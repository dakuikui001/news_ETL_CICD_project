Alarm clock sounds disrupt Tiong Bahru residents up to 8 times a day for over a month,"Jan 15, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 15, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/595b0ec2299bcdfa58b721dd4b4ea372343b95f10a65ca9475e8ada2cc1c5e3d,Residents believe the noise came from a unit in Block 55 Tiong Bahru Road that has been unoccupied since early December.ST PHOTO: JASEL POH,"['HDB', 'Community', 'Neighbours']","SINGAPORE – Alarm clocks have been disrupting the lives of residents in a Tiong Bahru neighbourhood since early December, ringing up to eight times a day for about an hour each time. Residents in Block 55 Tiong Bahru Road and Block 56 Eng Hoon Street told The Straits Times that the alarms, which go off at random hours, are a nuisance to those working from home and have jolted some awake in the middle of the night. Several residents have made police reports and filed complaints with Tanjong Pagar Town Council. They believe the noise came from a unit in Block 55 that has been unoccupied since early December. Residents said the sounds were last heard on Jan 12. When ST visited the unit on Jan 13, a property agent was conducting viewings there. The person denied that the sounds came from the property. Ms Sara K., 26, who rents a room in Block 55 near the source of the noise, said the loud ringing woke her up at 6am on some days. I would leave the house and still hear the ringing in my head, added Ms K., who works in tech and resorted to using noise-cancelling earphones. The sound, which varied in volume but was loud most times, started on Dec 3. Ms K. was overseas from mid-December to Jan 6 and was dismayed to find the noise still ongoing when she returned. Wouldnt an alarm clock run out of battery? she said. Ms Tamzin Adriaanse, 35, a South African who moved into a co-living unit in Block 55 in October, said the noise put a damper on her stay. It was also a disturbance when her mother visited her for two weeks in December. I thought I could ignore it and, hopefully, it would go away. I work from home so I try my best to block it out, said the personal assistant, who typically heard the noise around five times a day. Mr P.C. Chia, 45, who lives in Block 56, said the kitchen area of the unit he lives in faces the back alley where the sound originated. He said some of the alarms were extra loud – as if they were coming from outside a unit, rather than inside. According to Mr Chia, who is a freelancer, the sounds mainly occurred in 12-hour intervals and went off up to eight times a day. If I hear a 2pm alarm, I will be dreading another at 2am, he said. Mr Chia and his partner filed three police reports on the matter. Ms Danielle V., 31, who works in advertising, called the police on Jan 10 after hearing the alarm at around 1am. She said that when the police arrived, they shone a torchlight at the unit from the back alley, which triggered a loud siren-like sound that was different from the usual alarm. (The alarm) has been going on for more than a month, and its quite disruptive, so I hope it would be resolved soon, she added. In response to ST queries, a spokesman for Tanjong Pagar Town Council said on Jan 14 that the council and relevant agencies, including the Housing Board and police, are aware of the residents concerns and are conducting investigations. Blocks 55 and 56 are among flats built by the Singapore Improvement Trust, the predecessor to the HDB. Built in 1967, the three-storey walk-up flats are among 20 blocks given conservation status by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2003 to preserve their art deco architecture and unique features. Tiong Bahru recently made the headlines after two HDB blocks narrowly missed a75 per cent threshold for the Home Improvement Programme, disappointing some residents.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/alarm-clock-sounds-disrupt-tiong-bahru-residents-up-to-8-times-a-day-for-over-a-month
"Professional development, inter-team collaboration and well-being: Inside a workplace that prioritises its people","Jan 15, 2026, 04:00 AM",,https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0da18602ce586997ec843f6b34f784a96f13f9dee94f01a905541ec28441d030,"At the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), staff look forward to townhalls that often feature fun themes, such as this Super MHA HQ–themed session designed to build connection across divisions.PHOTO: MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS","['Ministry of Home Affairs', 'Careers', 'Working life', 'Branded content']","At the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) headquarters, townhalls are designed to be immersive experiences that play a role in shaping culture, reinforcing collective identity and enhancing collaboration. Everyone often comes away feeling energised and more connected to the people they work with. I remember one aviation-themed townhall where we were onboard the Phoenix Airlines, says Mr Jansen Tham, a deputy director of policy development and security at MHAs Policy Development Division. The fictional airline was a nod to the New Phoenix Park, where the MHA headquarters is located. He says: It was an apt theme because it signified that we were on the same flight, led by our captains – senior management – heading towards a common destination that we all agreed on. In other townhalls, MHA colleagues found themselves entering the worlds of Harry Potter, Formula One racing, Lego, Super MHA HQ – a reference to Super Mario, and even Multiverse, which coincided with the release of the Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness movie. These atypical townhalls are just one way MHA reinforces a people-centric culture, helping their team members relate more closely to the organisations mission and values. Apart from prioritising employee engagement, MHA continually invests in its officers through tailored training, and a broad spectrum of learning and development opportunities, ensuring that each individual can thrive and develop in their role. Ms Ashley Yeo, an assistant director of resource planning at the Planning and Organisation Division, has attained multiple accreditations in the past seven years – including Certified Internal Auditor – with MHAs support. She is also awarded the MHA Postgraduate Scholarship and plans to embark on a masters programme in 2028. For my colleagues in the finance and audit domain, they are highly encouraged to take on accreditations, says Ms Yeo. MHA places a lot of emphasis on training and upskilling. Mr Tham similarly benefited from the organisations support for lifelong learning. He took up a masters in public policy, along with a six-month student exchange programme in Washington, DC. That experience broadened my perspectives on international relations and allowed me to better appreciate Singapores place in the world, and how countries can and should work together to address geopolitical and security challenges, he says. At MHA, learning is also supported by structured mentorship programmes and initiatives that bring officers together to share experiences and insights. Mr Tham says: One perk here is that supervisors are very generous with their time to guide and advise staff, and lead by example. I have also benefitted from mentors in MHA who have helped me to navigate career transitions. Divisions in MHA Headquarters take turns to organise monthly Coffee Connect sessions, creating opportunities for employees to connect with one another including with senior management in casual settings. One formative shared experience that many MHA colleagues find memorable is the Home Team Foundation Course, an experiential programme that senior Home Team officers typically attend within their first two years of service. Its a two-week stay-in course where we get to visit all the Home Team agencies and understand each others work, Ms Yeo says. She notes that being able to see how the Home Team agencies – such as the Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority – work made her appreciate what they do on a daily basis more. It was memorable wearing the SCDF bunker gear, she says. Just wearing it helped me to appreciate the fitness level that our firefighters must have. To this day, she and her course mates from the Home Team Foundation Course meet at least once a year to catch up and swap the latest stories about their personal lives and work. In my work, one of the things I look at is manpower needs, says Ms Yeo. When my friends from the other Home Team agencies share about how manpower impacts their operations, it really helps me to see from their perspectives the impact of my resourcing work in achieving the safety and security of Singapore. At MHA, the seriousness of the mission to keep Singapore safe and secure is balanced by an appreciation that people need time to unwind and recharge to do their best work. Through Communities of Interest (COIs), employees regularly connect across departments over shared pursuits – whether on the pickleball court, at badminton sessions or even during trampoline workouts. Ms Yeo is co-leading one COI called Stare What Stair where members spend their lunchtime scaling up 18 floors at the MHA headquarters fives times, keeping fit while cultivating friendships. At MHA headquarters, every first Friday of the month MHA colleagues get to finish work early to spend quality time with their families. During Family Day, they can invite their family members to visit their workplace and during Wellness Week which takes place every year in October, employees can enjoy a range of initiatives including foot and shoulder massages, wellness workshops and dialogue sessions with senior management to explore new ideas on achieving a healthier work-life balance. Ms See Puay Ling, senior assistant director at the Finance and Administration Division, says: The people, a nurturing culture and the sense of purpose in the work are the three main reasons I enjoy working at MHA. There is a sense of warmth when it comes to the people here. These interactions are not transactional and that makes a big difference. You feel that you are being taken care of, and that you are valued. Kick-start your career at the Ministry of Home Affairs by applying for an MHA scholarship.

Whats next for Pritam Singh? Analysts weigh in,"Jan 14, 2026, 11:54 PM","Jan 15, 2026, 02:01 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/89b353049e442bcc4ebf4b838d0a033547b62f1dd156cc0013995b4529cff52c,WP chief Pritam Singh and his wife leaving Parliament House on Jan 14.ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Pritam Singh', 'Workers\' Party', 'Leader of the Opposition', 'Raeesah Khan']","SINGAPORE – With Parliament agreeingthat Workers Party chief Pritam Singh is unsuitable to continue as Leader of the Opposition (LO), political analysts expect Prime Minister Lawrence Wong to make a decision on the matter, though they are divided on how soon this could happen. Several analysts said they expect PM Wong to remove Mr Singh from the post, which is conferred by the prime minister. Singapore Management University associate law professor Eugene Tan reckons PM Wong will remove Pritam as LO swiftly. It is clear that Pritams days as LO are numbered, he said. Prof Tan added that as long as Mr Singh remains the WPs secretary-general, the Prime Minister is unlikely to appoint another MP from the party to be LO. This means the position could remain vacant for at least three months, the expected duration of the WPs disciplinary process. The WP had announced on Jan 3 that itwould form a disciplinary panelto assess whether Mr Singh had breached the partys Constitution following his conviction, with the process expected to conclude within three months. This came after a group of WP cadre members submitted a request to hold a special conference. On Jan 14, Parliament voted in support of a motion stating that Mr Singh was unsuitable to continue as LO after his conviction for lying to a parliamentary committee. Following a three-hour debate, the House agreed that his conduct overformer WP MP Raeesah Khans 2021 lie in Parliamentfell short of the standards expected of an LO and would undermine Parliaments standing and public confidence in Singapores political system. If Parliament has decided that Pritam should not retain the LO position, I dont see the PM disagreeing, said Mr Inderjit Singh, a former PAP MP who retired from politics in 2015. Independent political observer Felix Tan expects PM Wong to issue a statement on the matter within the week. Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) senior research fellow Gillian Koh said PM Wong could make a decision soon, or allow the WPs disciplinary process to run its course first. Under that scenario, if there is to be a Leader of the Opposition and the WP is the only opposition party in the House, it stands to reason that its secretary-general is offered the position, said Dr Koh. If there is a change in WPs leadership, the position of LO could be offered to the new secretary-general, she added. Dr Koh noted that voters had not appeared to penalise the WP overMr Singhs court conviction. In the 2025 General Election, the partys five-member team in Aljunied GRCretained the constituencywith 59.68 per cent of the vote, against the PAPs 40.32 per cent. The WP is expected to continue operating on a business as usual basis, she said. Any move to remove Mr Singh as LO would be largely symbolic, said BowerGroupAsia managing director Nydia Ngiow. Regardless of title, he remains leader of the Workers Party, which continues to anchor the opposition presence in Parliament and functions as the de facto LO, she said. Dr Felix Tan agreed, saying that even without an LO, the WP can still raise questions and motions in Parliament, and the opposition presence would remain unchanged. Analysts said the debate played out in a predictable manner, with MPs speaking and voting along party lines. They were not surprised that the WP MPs closed ranks around Mr Singh and put up a united front, with all 11 MPs in the House voting against the motion. The PAP MPs and Nominated MPs agreed with the motion. Prof Eugene Tan said the remarks by the WP MPs who joined the debate showed that they have put a lot of weight on Pritams continued belief that he is innocent and that his mistake was that he did not move quickly enough on Ms Khans lie in Parliament. IPS senior research fellow Teo Kay Key said the outcome of WPs internal processes would be more telling of his standing within the party. Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore, said the collective dissent against the motion by WP MPs may serve as a morale and political booster for Pritams standing within the party against the backdrop of an internal disciplinary hearing and a special cadre members conference thereafter. Dr Tan Ern Ser, an adjunct principal research fellow at IPS, said the WP may believe that the court of opinion is on their side, and stick to their guns. The WP will let its disciplinary tribunal and special cadre members conference run its course, and assess the broader publics response to the debate, Dr Koh said. WP will likely get a sense of how other Singaporeans view the matter; whether the principles of honesty and integrity in the most important decision-making body of the land and democratic processes have been compromised or at stake… or that it actually has no impact on public sentiment or perhaps is even brushed off, said Dr Koh. She added that the debate in the House provided a sobering reminder of the duty that all MPs, both PAP and Opposition, have in maintaining standards of honesty and integrity. If they falter, they have to answer the case against them but how much more so if they spoke untruths before a committee hearing designed specifically to uncover untruths, said Dr Koh.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/whats-next-for-pritam-singh-analysts-weigh-in

In a Facebook post on Jan 14, CASE president Melvin Yong said the organisation is aware of a listing on Carousell advertising BTS 2026 World Tour Singapore tickets at $88, although ticket sales have not yet begun. The Straits Times found, at about 10.30pm on Jan 14, two listings by the same seller on Carousell, purportedly selling tickets to the bands concert in Singapore. BTS is set to play in Singapore after seven years, on Dec 17, 19, 20 and 22 – the most number of shows to be held by the group here to date. In his Facebook post, Mr Yong added that as details of the concerts, including ticket sales, have not been announced, CASE advised consumers to not buy tickets from unauthorised online sellers as they risk getting scammed. Consumers are encouraged to purchase tickets only through official and authorised ticketing channels, and to avoid making advance payments to unverified sellers, especially when tickets have not yet been officially released, Mr Yong said in his post. He added that most ticket providers had stated in their terms and conditions that they would void tickets that were deemed to have been resold. The Consumer Protection Review Panel is actively engaging ticket service providers to expedite the roll-out of authorised ticket sale platforms, to provide consumers with greater certainty that tickets resold on proper platforms are legitimate, said Mr Yong. The panel is also studying suggestions, such as phasing out paper tickets and digital tickets with dynamic QR codes, he added.

Grouping HDB blocks with fewer units together for HIP voting under consideration: Chee Hong Tat,"Jan 14, 2026, 09:45 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 11:01 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/332284b4fd4dc05ca4b278874cb29449437a408e497ae9bfbf1fa206ca810a03,The Home Improvement Programme gets carried out after at least 75 per cent of a blocks eligible Singaporean households have voted for it.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI,"['Singapore Parliament', 'HDB', 'Public housing', 'Housing policy', 'Ministry of National Development']","SINGAPORE – The authorities are studying grouping HDB blocks with fewer units together to vote for the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) as a cluster, so that enough households participate in the voting process. In a written parliamentary reply on Jan 14, National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat said this is one option the authorities are considering to address the challenges faced by blocks with fewer units. We understand that under the current voting process, blocks with fewer eligible units may face greater risks of not reaching 75 per cent of votes to proceed with HIP, he said. This comes aftertwo HDB blocks in Tiong Bahru narrowly missed the voting thresholdin November 2025, which disappointed some residents who hoped for improvements to their ageing flats. Mr Chee said the authorities arereviewing the voting process for such blocks, in order to strike a balance between upgrading older flats and respecting the decisions of flat owners. He was responding to Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast-Jurong West GRC), who asked how many HDB blocks had failed to garner enough votes for HIP in the last 10 years, how many were allowed a re-poll, and what was the outcome of each re-poll. Six HDB blocks were unable to garner the 75 per cent of votes needed to undergo HIP over the last 10 years, Mr Chee said. These were:one block in Serangoon Avenue 2 in 2017 and three blocks in Lengkong Tiga in 2023, as well as the two Tiong Bahru blocks. For the Serangoon and Lengkong Tiga blocks, HDB received appeals from flat owners and the MP for a re-poll. After careful review, HDB allowed these blocks to re-poll after about one year from the first poll. All four blocks re-polled successfully for HIP, he said. Checks showed the Serangoon block, which was built in 1984, has eight executive flats. The Lengkong Tiga blocks, built in 1988 and 1989, have between 10 and 55 executive flats each. The two Tiong Bahru blocks – Block 34 Kim Cheng Street and Block 35 Lim Liak Street – had failed to garner enough votes to pass the 75 per cent threshold by a narrow margin of two votes and one vote, respectively. Block 34 comprises 24 units, while Block 35 has 15 units. They were among 29 blocks in the neighbourhood where residents voted on whether to carry out HIP improvements. Voting for HIP was successful for the other 27 blocks. All the blocks are four-storey, walk-up flats built in 1949 by Singapore Improvement Trust, the predecessor to HDB. Residents in the two blocks which were unsuccessful in voting for HIP could get a second chance to vote in 2026, depending on the level of support from residents, Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Foo Cexiang told The Straits Times in December 2025. He previously said that a sizeable proportion of units in the neighbourhood were rented out. Several owners were uncontactable or felt little incentive to support HIP, including those who had just moved in after doing major renovation works. HIP was launched in 2007 to spruce up older housing estates and resolve common maintenance problems, such as spalling concrete. The programme gets carried out after at least 75 per cent of a blocks eligible Singaporean households have voted for it. Permanent resident households are not eligible to vote. Mr Chee said that apart from HIP, HDB supports flat owners who face ceiling leaks and spalling concrete through the Goodwill Repair Assistance scheme, under which HDB subsidises 50 per cent of the repair cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners. Households with seniors can also apply directly to HDB for the installation of senior-friendly fittings under the Enhancement for Active Seniors programme.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/grouping-hdb-blocks-with-fewer-units-together-for-hip-voting-under-consideration-chee-hong-tat
Agencies reviewing plans to develop more vegetation in Serangoon River forest: Alvin Tan,"Jan 14, 2026, 09:30 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:42 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/81f8ce4e56b58ca5b1cf9d98119058011a29e0574c50414829ab4f297fd0b717,A coalition of residents and nature advocates has called for an environmental study for works on Lorong Halus bus depot.ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Environmental issues', 'Ministry of National Development', 'LTA', 'Public transport']","SINGAPORE – Government agencies are reviewing plans to develop more vegetation along the eastern bank of the Serangoon River, Minister of State for National Development Alvin Tan told Parliament on Jan 14.A coalition of residents and nature advocates has called for an environmental study for works onLorong Halus bus depot, which is sited on one of several tracts of woodland on the eastern bank of the river, informally dubbed the Serangoon River forest. Reiterating their call, Workers Party MP Dennis Tan (Hougang) gave a speech in Parliament about the need to rethink the redevelopment and preservation of green spaces in Singapore. In response, Mr Alvin Tan reiterated that the area east of the river, also known as Sungei Serangoon, has been zoned for industrial use since the 1998 Master Plan. He said the land was intended to be progressively developed to bring economic development and jobs closer to residents of nearby towns, such as Hougang and Sengkang, and to future residents of the upcoming towns at Defu andPaya Lebar Air Base. Plots of vegetation along the river stretch from Tampines Road to Serangoon East Dam. The bus depot that serves residents in the area was rezoned and published in the Government Gazette in December 2023, said Mr Alvin Tan, who is also Minister of State for Trade and Industry. It was deemed that an environmental study was not needed because it was not a sensitive nature area, the environmental impact of the depot was limited and its habitats generally had lower ecological value, he added. So this is a considered decision and we will not revisit the matter, he said. Beyond the bus depot, the agencies will review potential development plans for the remaining areas and continue to carefully plan for the provision of greenery and recreation spaces there. Citing the development of Serangoon River forest, Mr Dennis Tan had called for the Government to recognise the ecological premium of established greenery and prioritise green spaces based on their regional function, as part of a slew of suggestions to improve Singapores approach to developing green spaces. As the Government plans the massive new HDB town at the Paya Lebar Air Base site, it must recognise that large parts of the limited existing green spaces within and on the eastern fringe of the airbase will be developed or severely affected by the construction, he said. He suggested that the Government can retain Serangoon River forest to mitigate any heat impact from the future town, instead of relying on artificially created parks. He also called on agencies to clearly demonstrate that they had explored avoiding and minimising the reduction of green spaces, before mitigation measures are proposed. According to him, residents who appealed to the authorities for the bus depot site to be shifted were not given a reason why the bus depot had to be sited in the middle of the forested area between Buangkok East Drive and Tampines Road. A Land Transport Authority (LTA) spokesperson said on Jan 14 in a statement that the bus depot will serve as an operating base for bus services in the east and north-east regions, as the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base is expected to commence from the 2030s. LTA said: New public transport infrastructure needs to be introduced ahead of time to support public transport connectivity to these areas and provide additional capacity in the east and north-east regions for a growing bus fleet to better serve commuters, especially for growing towns and estates, and connect them to employment centres. It was responding to queries from The Straits Times sent in November 2025. The authority said the future Lorong Halus industrial area was assessed to be the most suitable site in the east and north-east regions to meet the requirements of a bus depot, considering factors such as its size, location and availability of other sites. It said measures will be put in place to limit environmental impact and protect any wildlife in the area. These include earth control measures to prevent untreated discharge and sediment from entering water bodies and forested areas, hoarding up the entire worksite, conducting pre-tree felling checks for bird nests and other wildlife before clearing the site. LTA also said it conducts environmental monitoring and compliance checks on its contractor. Areas zoned for business use have catered for adequate buffer between the development and nearby residential premises to minimise nuisance impacts. The bus depot is located 200m from the nearest residential development. A 12m-high temporary noise barrier facing the residential area has also been installed to insulate sound from construction activities, LTA added. When completed, the Lorong Halus bus depot is expected to house at least 550 buses.

Allowing shorter-term renewals will likely amplify peak and trough of COE cycles: Jeffrey Siow,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:45 PM","Jan 15, 2026, 06:48 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/60edc667c7d7bdf1637dfd195f3f621f9c96c07df99146668af81c12ac77ebf2,"Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow said that besides the needs of existing owners, the interest of those who want to buy a new car also needs to be considered.ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG","['Singapore Parliament', 'COE', 'Ministry of Transport', 'LTA']","SINGAPORE - Allowing the renewal of certificates of entitlement (COEs) for shorter periods than the current five or 10 years will likely amplify the peaks and troughs of the COE supply cycle and reduce the quota available for prospective car owners, said Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow. He was responding in Parliament on Jan 14 to a question by Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang West) about whether shorter-term COE renewal of one or two years could be considered as a potentially more affordable option for owners touse their vehicles beyond 10 years, given the high COE premiums. A COE allows a vehicle to be used for 10 years. The price to renew is the moving average of COE prices over the preceding three months. In 2025, a 10-year COE renewal cost between $92,064 and $116,000. Mr Siow said: We understand the concerns of existing car owners who wish to renew their COEs. However, we need to balance their interests with those who wish to buy a new car. Today, we already allow existing car owners to renew COEs for five years as a concession. If we allow for shorter renewals, its likely to amplify the peak and trough of the COE cycles further. It would mean that more car owners will renew their COEs when prices are high, and this would reduce the supply of new COEs for prospective car owners. So we will not make this move. While a five-year renewal costs half as much as a 10-year renewal, the COE cannot be extended further. When the five-year period lapses, the car must be deregistered and the COE returned to the pool for bidding. Shorter renewal periods could amplify the peak and trough of the COE cycles because more car owners would deregister their vehicles when COE prices are low, or renew their certificates when prices are high. Under the current policy, the main determinant of COE supply is the number of vehicles that are deregistered in the previous four quarters. Ms Poh asked if shorter-term COE renewals could be permitted for commercial vehicles to help small-business owners, such as hawkers, avoid the heavy cost of renewals to keep their vehicles on the road. Mr Siow said he fully understands the pressures small businesses face in an environment of high COE prices. He noted that commercial vehicle owners can already renew COEs for five-year periods repeatedly until the vehicle reaches its statutory lifespan. It is something that, I think, is fair because you also want to allow new businesses that wish to have access to vehicles to be able to compete for COEs. And I think the better approach is for them to be able to bid in the same market, and for the COE to be priced accordingly, he said.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/allowing-shorter-term-renewals-will-likely-amplify-peak-and-trough-of-coe-cycles-jeffrey-siow
Govt close to finalising details of retirement investment option: Tan See Leng,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:05 PM","Jan 15, 2026, 12:19 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/47a5a5aaac4b4c8642027d0e1a9bf23f6bb7ef972be8e2e024a513545c068e21,The previously proposed CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme is billed as a simple and low-cost investment alternative to the Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme products..ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Ministry of Manpower', 'CPF', 'Retirement', 'Financial planning']","SINGAPORE – CPF members who want to invest their savings in a retirement investment scheme,first announced and accepted by the Government in 2016, will have to wait a little longer to do so. The Ministry of Manpower is in the final stages of studying its response to the CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS) and will give updates when it is ready. The previously proposed LRIS is billed as a simple and low-cost investmentalternative to the Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme (CPFIS) products. It would be applicable for CPF members who want to invest but feel they lack the financial expertise and/or time and resources to actively manage their investments. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng was responding in Parliament to a question from Mr Shawn Loh (Jalan Besar GRC), who asked if the delay in implementing the LRIS may deprive CPF members of an option to take risks to earn higher expected returns. Mr Loh pointed out that a typical investment portfolio with 65 per cent invested in equities and 35 per cent in bonds had earned 9.5 per cent returns every year over the past five years. Dr Tan said the Government is studying how it can provide further support to CPF members to plan for their retirement. The retirement investment option that will eventually be introduced should strike the right balance between risk and return, he added. Dr Tan said CPF members can already invest their savings through a number of low-cost funds under the CPFIS for potentially higher returns. According to investment research firm Morningstar, the investment consultant for the CPFIS, all CPFIS funds – unit trusts and investment-linked insurance products – had an average one-year return of 11.78 per cent in Singapore dollar terms for the third quarter ended September 2025. Cumulative returns reached 37.03 per cent over three years, equivalent to a return of 10.74 per cent a year. Acknowledging Mr Lohs comment that time in the market is more important than timing the market, Dr Tan said he fully agreed with him. However, he added that much also depends on how much time each investor has in the market. For instance, if a product was launched recently and an investor had to liquidate his investments during a downturn for his retirement needs, he would have experienced a drop in the investment value. The investor would not have been able to benefit from enough time in the market to ride out the market falls, ultimately impacting his retirement adequacy, Dr Tan said. He added that the objective has always been to safeguard retirement adequacy. When pressed by Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) on whether there will be an update in 2026, Dr Tan would not be drawn into giving a specific timeframe. We are close to finalising the details, he said, noting that the CPF Board is reviewing the recommendations made by the CPF advisory panel in 2016. Dr Tan added that time has passed and markets have evolved since then, necessitating a deeper look into which suggestions can be incorporated into the retirement investment option. Associate Professor Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) wanted to find out more and asked if there will be one that is fully geared towards Singapore equities. Dr Tan said the construct of the retirement investment option would take into account different weightages of global equities and bonds. He added that it will be a glide path, an investment strategy where an investor takes more risks by holding more equities versus bonds when young. Then, as retirement nears, that investor will take less risk by holding more bonds. The investor is essentially gliding towards retirement with the aim of preserving/protecting his CPF savings as he gets older. Apart from investing their CPF savings, members can choose to leave their money in the Ordinary Account (OA) and Special Account (SA) to earn the risk-free rate of return. A CPF member who is below 55 would earn 2.5 per cent on his OA savings and 4 per cent on his SA savings, with an extra 1 per cent on the first $60,000 of combined balances. The extra interest is capped at $20,000 for the OA. CPF members who are 55 and above would earn 2.5 per cent on the OA and 4 per cent on the Retirement Account, with an extra 2 per cent on the first $30,000 of combined balances and an additional 1 per cent on the next $30,000 of combined balances. The extra interest is capped at $20,000 for the OA.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/govt-close-to-finalising-details-of-retirement-investment-option-tan-see-leng
Parliament deems Pritam Singh unsuitable to continue as Leader of the Opposition,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:03 PM","Jan 15, 2026, 01:53 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e3dd4a32a2a34f31098c01079933550d5019ad481c26a2ae077704ba382bc60f,The decision on whether to retain WP chief Pritam Singh in the Leader of the Opposition post rests with PM Lawrence Wong.PHOTO: MDDI,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Pritam Singh', 'Leader of the Opposition', 'Workers\' Party', 'Raeesah Khan']","SINGAPORE - The House has expressed the view that Workers Party chief Pritam Singh is unsuitable to stay on as the Leader of the Opposition (LO), following his conviction for lying to a parliamentary committee. Following a three-hour debate on Jan 14, the House approved a motion that said Mr Singhs conduct and conviction in relation to then WP MP Raeesah Khanslie in Parliament in 2021meant he had fallen short of the requirements and standards expected of an LO. Hence, Mr Singhs continuation as LO would undermine the standing of Parliament and public confidence in the integrity of Singapores political system, added the motion, which wasraised by Leader of the House Indranee Rajah. All 11 WP MPs in the House stood up to record their disagreement, while Non-Constituency MP Eileen Chong was not present. The Nominated MPs and the PAP MPs agreed with the motion. As the position of LO is conferred by the prime minister, the decision on whether to retain Mr Singh in the post rests with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. The Straits Times has contacted the Prime Ministers Office for comment. Opening the debate, Ms Indranee noted the High Courts decision on Dec 4, 2025, to uphold Mr Singhs conviction on two counts of lying to the Committee of Privileges (COP). In sum, she said, Mr Singh had guided Ms Khan twice to maintain her lie to Parliament; he lied twice before the COP; and he lied before the court. Mr Singh also lied to the public, and concealed material information from his own party, she added. There are simply too many lies – they pile up, one on top of another, each one to cover up a previous lie, she said. And that is a problem, as Mr Singh is also the Leader of the Opposition. The courts findings meant the matter had come full circle back to Parliament, she added. Ms Indranee said Parliament derives its authority from not only the law, but also the confidence and trust reposed by Singaporeans in its processes and MPs. An MPs lies to Parliament or before its committees are, therefore, not just a personal lapse or a tactical misjudgment. It strikes at the trust Singaporeans place in us... It undermines the high standards of integrity and incorruptibility which make the Singaporean system work, and for which Singapore is known, she said. That is why I have brought this motion before Parliament. Ms Indranee noted that the court had already fined Mr Singh, which dealt with the criminal offences. On Feb 17, 2025, the district courtfined Mr Singh the maximum of $7,000on each of his two charges. The House was not being asked to impose further penalties on Mr Singh, said Ms Indranee. But his conduct and conviction reflect directly on Parliament, and it must decide whether such conduct is acceptable for an MP, and in this case, the LO. The motion also asked the House to affirm that honesty and integrity are fundamental pillars of Singapores parliamentary system, she added. Members are entitled to, and I will argue have an obligation to, express a view on Mr Singhs suitability to continue in the role (of Leader of the Opposition), said Ms Indranee. It will then be for the Prime Minister to decide what to do after that. Speaking after Ms Indranee, Mr Singh said that while he accepted the courts verdict fully and without reservation, he was disappointed with the judgment and did not agree with the findings. A criminal conviction does not negate ones right to assert innocence... In my case, my conscience will always be clear insofar as my conviction on both charges is concerned, he said. The WP chief said his lawyers had tendered evidence to the court that, in their legal opinion, render(ed) a conviction on both charges unsafe. Mr Singh said the Leader of the Opposition appointment was neither written into the Constitution nor written laws, and that he had never hankered for it. Whatever Parliament decides, and as long as I am a Member of Parliament, I will continue my work as an MP on the ground in Aljunied GRC, he said. WP MPs who joined the debate, including Aljunied GRC MPs Sylvia Lim and Gerald Giam, questioned whether the motion was an attempt to further punish Mr Singh, who had already been sentenced by the court and had paid his fines. I believe this motion today does not serve Singaporeans, but is a party political exercise, and I can foresee that our Parliament will slip further down the rule of law rankings on the factor of being able to effectively check government power, said Ms Lim, who is WPs chairwoman. Three NMPs – Ms Kuah Boon Theng, Mr Mark Lee and Dr Neo Kok Beng – participated in the debate, and called on Mr Singh to voluntarily relinquish the title of Leader of the Opposition. Ms Kuah, a senior counsel, noted that professions such as medicine and law have disciplinary tribunals that may take away the right of doctors and lawyers to practise when a member of their fraternity has been convicted of a serious criminal offence, or when a complaint of professional misconduct has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Rounding up the debate, Ms Indranee said the motion went beyond any individual or party, and was about upholding the integrity and standing of Parliament and the standard of conduct of the Republics MPs. We cannot endorse dishonourable conduct or ignore the courts judgment, and we cannot talk about a First-World Parliament and effective checks and balances if fundamental values of honesty, integrity and accountability are not upheld, she said. We have a solemn duty to make sure that politics in Singapore remains upright and honourable.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/parliament-deems-pritam-singh-unsuitable-to-continue-as-leader-of-the-opposition
Trump administration accused of slow-walking help to Pacific island veterans,"Jan 15, 2026, 06:55 AM","Jan 15, 2026, 06:55 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a1c6c0831c7e2c0968e46225bbeb5ecad051159eb874fa6387ec34c1ae2705ee,,"['FAS/FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION OF SINGAPORE', 'Marshall Islands', 'China']","WASHINGTON, Jan 14 - The Trump administration was accused on Wednesday of dragging its feet in delivering congressionally agreed benefits to Pacific island nations being courted by China to try to woo them away from the U.S. strategic orbit. The ambassadors of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia as well as Democratic lawmakers told a congressional hearing that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) had yet to implement extended benefits to veterans from the island nations who served with the U.S. armed forces. The benefits are provided for as part of new 20-year programs the United States agreed to with the so-called Freely Associated States during the Biden administration, under which Washington provides the islands with economic assistance and other benefits, while gaining exclusive military access to strategic swaths of the Pacific China covets. Citizens from the remote islands can live, study, and work in the U.S. and serve in the armed forces, and congressional legislation granted the VA authority to provide FAS veterans with enhanced access to care, such as telehealth visits, beneficiary travel, and mail-order pharmacy services. Unfortunately, the VA has yet to implement these authorities, Micronesias ambassador, Jackson Soram, said in testimony to the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs, which deals with FAS relations. Sadly, when our veterans return home, they face significant cost and access barriers to VA health care, he said, adding that those who traveled for treatment not available locally were forced to pay for expensive tickets in hopes of reimbursement. Sometimes they get reimbursed, sometimes not, he said. Soram said the islanders held productive talks with the VA after the last congressional oversight hearing in September 2024, but these were suspended in April 2025. We stand ready to restart talks and finalize the agreement as soon as possible, he said. VA Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz said 2024 legislation gave VA the option to provide direct medical care to FAS veterans, but did not provide the funding for that care. He said VA provided FAS veterans with the same benefits available to other eligible veterans living abroad and continues to work with the U.S. Congress to consider options for improved care for all Veterans, including those in the Freely Associated States. Anton Greubel, head of the State Department office responsible for the Pacific islands, told the hearing the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Michael DeSombre, would visit the Marshall Islands and Micronesia next week for talks on ensuring effective implementation of the agreements with the islands, known as the Compacts of Free Association (COFA). He called the FAS states essential partners and added: Their trust and cooperation are vital to our national security and economic interests ... We are committed to doing even more for the FAS in the year ahead. Democratic Representative Jared Huffman said it was vital to fully implement the agreements and added: Many of us are concerned that President Trump has seemed to be slow-walking delivery of our end of that bargain. Republican Representative Jeff Hurd said China was seeking to undermine U.S. regional leadership and to exert influence over the FAS through coercion. Now more than ever, it is essential that the COFA agreements are faithfully implemented as Congress intended, he said.

Taiwans vice-premier Cheng Li-chiun and trade envoy Yang Jen-ni are expected in Washington by Jan 15 for meetings with Trump administration officials, the source told Reuters. Two people familiar with the matter said an announcement could come by the end of the month. Taiwan aims to cut tariffs on its exports to the US to 15 per cent from 20 per cent, the government said in December. Taipei said on Jan 13 it had reached a broad consensus with Washington on the talks and was discussing a timetable for a concluding meeting. It did not comment on the meetings in Washington. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the meetings in Washington, which were first reported by Bloomberg News. It was not immediately clear which US officials would take part. A major semiconductor producer, Taiwan has said its offer to the US included help in replicating the islands success in building tech clusters around dedicated science parks. Under the deal, it is expected that chipmaker TSMC would commit to building more facilities in Arizona, according to one of the people. TSMC has declined to comment on whether it would invest more in the US on top of the US$165 billion (S$212.6 billion) that it has already pledged. Taiwans chips are not subject to the US tariffs. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijings claims. The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the islands most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The issue has been an irritant in US-China relations for years. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-envoys-head-to-washington-for-trade-investment-talks-source-says
Visit Malaysia 2026 tests countrys upgrade from ageing border control system,"Jan 15, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 15, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/65615d181e811c2c696a960d144070fb0f1c265f33066c29975d50e252b1ea14,"Foreigners at the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex had to wait up to two hours to clear immigration on Jan 10.PHOTO: THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK","['Malaysia', 'Johor', 'Johor Bahru', 'Woodlands Checkpoint']","JOHOR BAHRU– The Malaysian authorities have vowed that there will be no repeat of thesystem failure that left thousands of travellers stranded for hoursat both Johor land checkpoints with Singapore over the weekend, as the Visit Malaysia 2026 tourism campaign kicks off. The severe disruption at the Causeway and Second Link between Jan 10 and 12 exposed coordination gaps and raised questions about Malaysias ability to upgrade its 30-year-old immigration system without further chaos. Malaysia Border Control and Protection Agency (AKPS) director-general Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said on Jan 12 that Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahiminstructed the agencyto ensure the autogate glitch must not happen again, especially during this Visit Malaysia year. I personally have given instructions to all commanders... Should they see signs that the system is not working well, please let headquarters know in advance so troubleshooting measures can be executed earlier, he told reporters at an event in Putrajaya. Visit Malaysia years are nationwide campaigns by Tourism Malaysia to attract tourists and spur the countrys tourism economy. The last campaign was in 2020, and in 2014 and 2007 before that. Malaysias autogates under the unmanned automated immigration entry and exit system require only a passport scan for clearance. The glitch affected only foreign passport holders at the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex (BSI) in Johor Bahru and the Sultan Abu Bakar Complex (KSAB) at the Second Link, and led to snaking queues in the departure and arrival halls. The checkpoints have 39 autogates for entry and 29 for exit at BSI, while KSAB has 12 autogates. They serve more than 300,000 travellers daily. Singaporean Nicholas Tan told The Straits Times he entered Johor Bahru for a short weekend break with ease on Jan 9, but it was a different story on his return leg. I had to scan twice, said Mr Tan, who arrived at BSI at around 2.20pm. His second attempt, after a 10-minute wait, was successful, and he was out of the complex within 20 minutes. Everyone was complaining that they could not scan their passports at the autogate. But I think I was quite lucky, I was at the front of the crowd, he added. Johor exco Fazli Salleh announced that the technical glitchwas resolvedonlyon Jan 12. The Malaysian authorities have yet to issue a reason behind the disruption. Analysts warned that glitches may persist as Malaysia undergoes both administrative and technological overhauls at its borders. Problems may be compounded by coordination gaps between the new border agency AKPS and immigration authorities, who still control key system assets. The challenge here is how we see this process through with minimal disruption to the end-user (travellers), said Mr Harris Zainul, director of research at think-tank Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia. Compounding the challenge are two things: first, it is a Visit Malaysia year, which raises the stakes; and second, this autogate system is as front and centre as it gets with digital public infrastructure, where any downtime would be immediately noticeable. Datuk Seri Shuhaily said on Jan 12 that the ageing immigration system is being replaced with the new National Integrated Immigration System (NIISe), which will be the backbone of Malaysias immigration system in the future. The legacy immigration system being used by immigration authorities is 30 years old. While its data is being transferred to the new one, glitches can be expected here and there, Mr Shuhaily said. Agreeing, ISIS Malaysias director for cyber and technology policy Farlina Said noted: The challenge of systems required to produce continuous service is that upgrading technologies without creating further inconveniences would be a problem. The NIISe project was launched in 2021 by then Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to replace the Malaysian Immigration System, which was deemed vulnerable and prone to hacking. The project, initially developed by Iris Corporation, was terminated in 2023 due to delays. Tech company HeiTech Padu took over the project in October 2024, and has been tasked with completing the system within five years. Among the enhancements under the new NIISe system is the use of artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to enhance border security and allow faster immigration clearance. During the Jan 10 to 12 disruption, AKPS encouraged travellers to use the new NIISe app MyNIISe to hasten immigration clearance, to speed up clearance at the manual counters. MyNIISe allows foreign passport holders from 63 countries, including Singapore, to clear immigration via QR codes as part of a trial from Sept 22, 2025, to Feb 28, 2026. From a bureaucratic perspective, such technical glitches may reflect the change Malaysias border administration is going through, with AKPS being a newly set up agency and still in the process of fully taking over immigration assets. AKPS, which began operations in January 2025, is expected to assume full control of all 125 international entry points into Malaysia, including airports and seaports, by 2026. Its duties are toact as a coordinatorto six core agencies managing Malaysias border control and enforcement operations: the Immigration Department, the Customs Department, the Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services Department, the Health Ministry, the Wildlife and National Parks Department, and the Road Transport Department. Cybersecurity expert Mohamed Ridza Wahiddin from the International Islamic University Malaysia said that without full takeover of BSI assets by AKPS, this creates coordination delays, fragmented accountability and slower responses. Such issues were seen in the multi-day outage when there were delays in deploying officers to assist stranded travellers and encourage them to use MyNIISe. From a tech security view, split ownership risks inconsistent patching, vulnerability exposure in data migration, and potential exploits if access controls or encryption standards differ across agencies, he said. Immigration system outages in Malaysia are not new. In July,a glitch affecting all 200 autogate systemsin Malaysia resulted in long queues in Johors checkpoints and Kuala Lumpurs two international airports affecting solely foreign passport holders. Johors Menteri Besar Onn Hafiz Ghazi had described the incident as an embarrassment to the country. In December 2024, local media reported a technical malfunction impacting BSIs QR code scanning systems and autogates, resulting in a six-hour delay for travellers.

I saw bodies piled up inside a carriage with metal wreckage all over when I looked through the window... We tried to pull them out but they were trapped, 28-year-old waitress Penporn Poomrateuk told AFP. I felt scared, said Ms Penporn, who rushed to the scene after hearing the sounds of a train and then a crash from her familys restaurant in Thailands rural Nakhon Ratchasima province, north-east of the capital Bangkok. She said she felt pity for the stricken passengers, some travelled with their loved ones – some who were rescued but the other one wasnt. A crane at a construction site of a high-speed rail projectcollapsed onto the passenger trainbelow, causing it to derail. Nearly 200 people were on board the train which left from Bangkok, authorities said. I ran to the train and heard people crying for help. I helped pull the injured out from a carriage, said Ms Penporn, whose family-run restaurant is just across the road. Her husband, a cook at the restaurant, was busy filling orders at the time, she said. At the scene, Ms Penporn saw fire and fuel leaking from the tilted carriages. I called to people who could help themselves out. Some who had less serious injuries could climb out of the carriage, she told AFP. Ms Penporn said she ultimately helped pull 20 or 30 people from the wrecked train, some with minor injuries and others with serious head wounds. The health ministry said 32 people were killed, 64 injured and three missing. The collapsed launching gantry crane was left resting across giant concrete pillars – built to hold up a future elevated high-speed rail line – while mangled train cars that ran on Thailands existing network lay askew. Dozens of rescuers walked around the twisted metal carriages, searching with sniffer dogs for people still inside, while others used cranes from the high-speed rail project contractor Italian-Thai Development to remove debris. The firm expressed condolences, and promised to compensate the victims families and cover medical expenses for the injured. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, visiting the scene hours after the accident, said it was clearly the fault of the construction company. We must determine the cause so this incident can serve as a lesson, he told reporters. Thailands state rail operator said it ordered Italian-Thai to halt construction until an investigation was completed. Ms Pasinee Klaharn, a 31-year-old homemaker, said she had just started making breakfast when she heard a loud noise. She ran outside and reached the site of the accident, about 300m from her house. There, Ms Pasinee said she saw three people on the ground with head wounds and broken limbs. My husband climbed down inside a carriage and helped a couple of people before rescue teams arrived. Rescuer Nopporn Somjit told AFP his team helped carry around 10 bodies from the train while another group went inside the carriages to pull victims out. This is one of the most serious accidents I have worked during my 30 years of experience, he said.

According to a report released earlierin Januaryby the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, babies conceived through medical support such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or artificial insemination accounted for 15.1 per cent of all newborns in 2024, up from 8.7 per cent in 2019. In headcount terms, babies born through infertility treatment rose by about 37 per cent, from roughly 26,000 in 2019 to 36,000 in 2024. The faster growth in the proportion reflects a broader demographic shift. During the same period, South Koreas total number of newborns declined from 302,000 to 238,000. Total infertility treatment costs recorded by the Health Ministry increased from 227.7 billion won (S$200 million) to 555.5 billion won between 2018 and 2024. The trend coincides with delayed marriage in the country. The average age at first marriage has continued to rise for both men and women, a factor that affects fertility in both genders. According to the Ministry of Data and Statistics, the average age at first marriage for men increased from 33.15 to 33.86 between 2018 and 2024, while the figure for women rose from 30.4 to 31.55 over the same period. Older age groups now account for a growing share of fertility care recipients. The proportion of patients in their 40s rose from 25.5 per cent to 40.3 per cent during the same period. In response to rising demand, the government has expanded its support for infertility treatment as part of efforts to address rapid population ageing. By easing eligibility standards and increasing the number of subsidised treatment cycles, the number of supported treatment cases grew by 142.6 per cent, from 92,000 in 2020 to 223,000 in 2024.

Explainer: Why Japans Takaichi is gambling on an early election,"Jan 14, 2026, 07:46 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:10 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7900e1569f60b4755b7ed84e1b471a0a9875f096046779ee6b952b872cbb6a89,"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi speaks during a joint news conference with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung (not pictured) after their talk in Nara, western Japan, January 13, 2026. Eugene Hoshiko/Pool via REUTERS","['Japan', 'Innovation']","TOKYO, Jan 14 - Japans Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve parliaments lower house next week, triggering a national election to decide all 465 seats in her first major election test since taking office in October. She will announce details of the election on Monday, ruling Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Shunichi Suzuki said. WHY CALL AN ELECTION NOW? Japans first female premier inherited a battered government, with the LDP having lost its majority in both houses of parliament after disgruntled voters punished it over rising prices and a funding scandal. By calling a snap election now, she hopes to capitalise on a surge in public support for a new leader who has promised to spur economic growth, tackle cost-of-living concerns and tighten immigration rules. Some media polls have put the LDPs support at more than 60%, giving Takaichi an opportunity to restore its majority in the more powerful lower chamber. A poll of 1,213 people published by public broadcaster NHK on January 13 showed she had the backing of 62% of voters. Even if she bags a lower-house majority, however, Takaichi will still have to govern with a minority in the upper house, which she cannot dissolve. Voters elect half of its members every three years and the next election is not due until 2028. WHAT WOULD A STRONG RESULT DELIVER? A decisive victory would strengthen her hand within the LDP and reduce her reliance on smaller political parties to pass key legislation. That, in turn, could allow her to push ahead with plans to boost government spending to revive economic growth and sharply increase defence outlays under a revised national security strategy amid heightened tension with Japans powerful neighbour China. The shift could mark a further step from Japans post-war pacifist constraints, including a long-standing principle that bars nuclear weapons from the countrys territory. With prices still rising and the yens value against the U.S. dollar sliding, the cost of living is likely to dominate the election campaign. In the NHK poll 45% of respondents said that was their main concern, followed by diplomacy and national security at 16%. Her government has proposed record spending of $770 billion for the next fiscal year, a move that has unnerved investors in one of the worlds most indebted industrial economies. WHATS UP FOR GRABS? All 465 seats in the lower house will be contested, 289 in single-member districts and 176 through proportional representation. A simple majority requires 233 seats. The LDP currently controls 199 seats in the chamber and governs with the support of its coalition partner the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, which has 34 seats. The main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), has 148 seats in the house, followed by the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) with 27. Komeito, which quit its 26-year coalition with the LDP after Takaichi became leader, has 24 seats. Attention may also focus on how Takaichi fares against the far-right Sanseito Party, whose calls for tighter immigration controls siphoned votes from the LDP in last Julys upper house election, where it won 14 seats. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? By dissolving the lower house on January 23, Takaichi will trigger an official campaign period of around two weeks before voting day. If the LDP and Ishin secure a majority, she would be confirmed as prime minister in a special parliamentary session. If not, she may be forced to seek new coalition partners or the support of other smaller parties, a setback that would weaken her authority.

Mixed views in South Korea over death sentence request for Yoon,"Jan 14, 2026, 06:34 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 06:36 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/8845d5198160a0f4ea8bf58d11e85d6c5defed8714f743883387aad761ac4b85,"The special counsel had requested the death penalty for former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, who imposed an overnight martial law in December 2024.PHOTO: EPA","['South Korea', 'Yoon Suk Yeol', 'Death penalty/Capital punishment']","SEOUL – South Korea watchers expressed mixed views on Jan 13 after the special counsel requested thedeath penalty for former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, alleging he led an insurrection through a failed self-coup attempt. Even if Yoon is sentenced to death in the Feb 19 ruling and the sentence is later upheld by the Supreme Court, it remains highly unlikely he would be executed. South Korea is considered a de facto death penalty abolitionist, with no executions since December 1997, despite around 60 people remaining on death row. While largely symbolic, the harshest possible sentence for Yoon could have significant implications in a country long haunted by memories of military coups, dictatorship and repression prior to democratisation in 1987. The special counsels request is symbolically rich, even though Yoon is highly unlikely to be executed, said Dr Mason Richey, professor of international studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. The message is that the judicial system and government take abuse of martial law – and the potential for its tyrannical misuse – with utmost seriousness. Another expert echoed this view, emphasising the importance of sending a strong message that any threat to democracy is intolerable. Given the gravity of the situation, it seems appropriate to request the maximum sentence, even though the likelihood of execution is virtually zero, said Dr Benjamin Engel, assistant professor of Korean studies at Dankook University. The request and any subsequent sentence would signal that Yoons self-coup attempt is completely unacceptable in a democratic South Korea. Others, however, questioned whether the death penalty is appropriate, regardless of the seriousness of Yoons alleged actions. (Yoon) must be held fully accountable for his abuse of power and insurrection, said an executive of the European Chamber of Commerce in Korea, speaking to The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. However, the special counsels call for the death penalty feels disproportionate to the crime. The executive added that a lesser sentence such as life imprisonment, the minimum punishment for insurrection, would be more in line with modern South Korean values. US communications professional Spencer Waters, based in Busan, warned that pursuing the harshest penalty could worsen social division, especially amid claims the judiciary is under political pressure. Allegations of insurrection must be investigated thoroughly and independently, free from political influence, Mr Waters said. But seeking the harshest punishment risks deepening polarisation and turning the legal process into a symbolic or retaliatory act. A human rights group advocating for the abolition of capital punishment also argued against the death penalty, regardless of how serious the crime. No one is above the law, including a former president, but seeking the death penalty is a step backward, said Amnesty Internationals death penalty adviser Chiara Sangiorgio in a statement on Jan 13. Yoonsimposition of martial law in December 2024endangered fundamental human rights, prompting prosecutors to seek his execution. While accountability is vital, the death penalty undermines the very principles of human rights and dignity that the rule of law is meant to protect. The special counsels request and the courts upcoming decision in February could reshape South Koreas political landscape just five months ahead of local elections. It could also deal a potential blow to the conservative People Power Party ahead of the June elections, as Yoons sentencing could split the party. A death sentence may be Yoons final disgrace, but it could also turn him into a martyr among hardline conservatives, said Dr Engel. He noted that since the party has not completely severed ties with Yoon, internal strife between moderates and extremists is likely to persist. If the extremists prevail, the PPP may struggle in Junes elections. Dr Richey said Yoons sentencing would likely have a limited impact on overall voter sentiment. However, he noted that a conviction could slightly suppress conservative turnout if it causes confusion or division within the partys messaging.

REUTERS/Marko Djurica","['Greenland', 'Donald Trump']","NUUK, Jan 14 - In a blue wooden house perched above Nuuks sprawling fjord, Liv Aurora Jensen sat in her living room surrounded by the trappings of Greenlandic life - handmade cutting boards and ceramics, and Greenlands red and white flags tucked in beside a potted plant. With her husband Peter Jensen and their son Inuk, she waited in near silence in front of the television as a meeting between U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark got under way in the White House, some 2,000 miles away. Like many in Greenland, which has a population of around 57,000, Jensen, 62, hoped to the high-stakes meeting could help quell President Donald Trumps ambition of taking over the Danish overseas territory. I have been sleeping very, very badly, really, Liv said, describing the anxiety shared by many of her neighbours in recent weeks as Trump ups pressure on Denmark over the island. I was talking to my sister yesterday and I told her: Im trying not to get a panic attack. I really have to control myself not to start crying or panicking, and not to let all my thoughts spin out of control. She paused, looking out toward the fjord visible through her window. Its really frightening. I GOT SO EMOTIONAL As the meeting concluded and cameras showed the Danish foreign minister emerging from the White House, Liv leaned forward. What was his facial expression? she asked aloud, referring to Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen. She smiled when she exited the car, Inuk, 22, said to his mother, referring to Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenlands top diplomat. When the broadcast showed the Danish minister giving a fist bump to the Danish ambassador, Liv and Peter stood arm in arm in front of the television. Its a good sign, Liv said. Relief was visible on both their faces. I think its a good sign for future communication with the United States, Peter, 63, said. I hope the outcome will be that we continue, as we have done before, that Greenland is not taken over by the United States, but we have cooperation with the other countries such as the European Union, Denmark, and of course the United States. We want to be a people and country as we always have been. I think its possible, he said. But despite the talks, Trump reiterated his views later on Wednesday that the U.S. needs Greenland and that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect the island, even as he said that something will work out with respect to the future governance of the Danish territory. I dont think they will come here with military, Liv said, then added quietly: It would take them five minutes. The past weeks have shifted how she views America. I have lost some respect for the Americans. And I have lost all respect for President Trump because his rhetoric is like a 14-year-old boy who is bullying everybody, she said. Greenlands government said on Monday it will increase efforts to ensure the defence of the Arctic territory takes place under the auspices of NATO, and again rejected Trumps ambition to take over the island. SOME OF MY FRIENDS SAY WE ARE COOKED Their son Inuk, sitting on the sofa in front of the TV, had been following the crisis closely with his friends. When Trump first started saying he wanted Greenland years ago, we were like, This guys crazy. But as the time went on and things got more serious, we were down. Yesterday we were really scared of what might happen today, he said. Some of my friends say we are cooked. What his mother fears is change. We are afraid that he can take us like that, she said, snapping her fingers. Our culture will disappear, our language will disappear, and the whole way of living in Greenland will disappear, and we will become American, Liv continued.

Lufthansa said on Jan 14 that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Jan 14 until Jan 19. Some flights could also be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement. Nationwide anti-government protests in Iran started over economic hardships at the end of December 2025 and have spiralled over the past month with several protesters reported killed while authorities moved to black out the internet to curb growing unrest. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran. Irans protests follow bouts of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East which have elevated tensions across the region. The situation has spiked volatility in markets. Investors have piled into safe havens such as gold and the dollar. The German airline group said in its statement that affected passengers would be automatically rebooked and proactively contacted and added that crews flying into Israel and Amman would fly back directly without an overnight stay on site. Separately, Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Jan 20.

The proclamation cited national security concerns for the tariffs, and is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places like Taiwan. The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 per cent of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains. This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk, the proclamation said. US President Donald Trump has deployed an array of tariffs aimed at bolstering American manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping new import tariffs, including 100 per cent duties on branded drugs and 25 per cent levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm. In April, the Trump administration announced probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat. While US companies like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips,most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The tariff will be narrowly focused and will not apply to chips imported for U.S. data centres - a huge consumer of AI chips - startups, non-data centre consumer applications, non-data centre civil industrial applications and US public sector applications. Mr Trump, in the near future, may also impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products to incentivize domestic manufacturing, according to the fact sheet.

Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Mr Rasmussen said the US and Denmark would form a working group to discuss a broad array of concerns regarding the Danish overseas territory. But he also made clear that Washington had not budged on its position that it must acquire Greenland, an outcome Mr Rasmussen and Ms Motzfeldt described as an unacceptable breach of sovereignty. We didnt manage to change the American position, Mr Rasmussen told reporters outside the Danish embassy in Washington after the meeting concluded. Its clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland. Mr Trump has repeatedly said in recent weeks that the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to US security, and the US must own it to prevent Russia or China from occupying it. He has said all options are on the table for securing the territory, rhetoric that has caused turmoil within the NATO alliance. Before the meeting, which lasted around two hours, Mr Trump argued on social media that NATO would becomefar more formidable and effectivewith Greenland in the hands of the US. Anything less than that is unacceptable, he wrote. In a follow-up post citing Russia and China, Mr Trump wrote: NATO: Tell Denmark to get them out of here, NOW! Two dogsleds wont do it! Only the USA can!!! Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale, and that threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies. Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark, which is a member of the NATO alliance. Ahead of the meeting, which lasted less than two hours, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun toincrease their military presencein and around Greenland in close cooperation with NATO allies, as part of their promise to beef up Arctic defence. The increased military presence would include a range of exercise activities throughout 2026, according to the Danish defence ministry. During the press conference, Mr Rasmussen and Ms Motzfeldt called the meeting respectful and emphasised that Denmark shared US concerns about Arctic security. But they firmly rejected the idea of the island becoming American. The meeting presented an opportunity for Copenhagen and Nuuk to de-escalate the crisis and find a diplomatic path to satisfy US demands for more control, analysts said. Mr Noa Redington, an analyst and former political adviser to previous Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said concerns were high in Denmark and Greenland that Ms Motzfeldt and Mr Rasmussen could be treated in the same way as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when hesuffered a public humiliationin a meeting with Mr Trump - and Mr Vance - at the White House in February 2025. This is the most important meeting in modern Greenlands history, he told Reuters. Denmark and Greenland had originally sought a meeting with Mr Rubio, hoping to have a discussion among top diplomats on resolving the crisis between the two NATO allies. But Denmarks Mr Rasmussen said Mr Vance had also wanted to participate and that the vice-president would host the meeting himself, at the White House. Greenlandic leaders appear to be shifting their approach in how they are handling the diplomatic crisis. Until recently, they were stressing Greenlands path to independence. But now their public statements put more emphasis on Greenlands unity with Denmark. Its not the time to gamble with our right to self-determination, when another country is talking about taking us over, Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told Greenland daily Sermitsiaq in an interview published on Jan 14. That doesnt mean that we dont want something in the future. But here and now, we are part of the kingdom, and we stand with the kingdom. Thats crucial in this serious situation, he said. Ms Motzfeldt had a similar message. We choose the Greenland we know today – as part of the Kingdom of Denmark, she said, in a statement released by the Danish ambassador to the US late on Jan 13. Mr Trumps desire for Greenland contrasts with Americans opposition to annexation of the Arctic island, according to a new poll. Just 17 per cent of Americans approvedof Mr Trumps efforts to acquire Greenland, and substantial majorities of Democrats and Republicans opposed using military force to annex the island, the Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Some 47 per cent of respondents disapproved of US efforts to acquire Greenland, while 35 per cent said they were unsure, in the two-day poll which concluded on Jan 13. Meanwhile, European allies reiterated their backing for Denmark and Greenland ahead of the White House meeting, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying on Jan 14 that Greenlanders could count on us. In Paris, Frances Emmanuel Macron said that, if the sovereignty of a European country and ally were to be affected, the knock-on effects would be unprecedented.

Trump threatens funding for states over sanctuary cities as clashes intensify in Minneapolis,"Jan 15, 2026, 04:40 AM","Jan 15, 2026, 07:10 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1f58b99a722f394876dfb5e2b1576419caa927eb7eed46407f82098a94fefef3,"Border Patrol agents deploy tear gas as they clash with residents in a neighbourhood on Jan 12 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.PHOTO: AFP","['Protests', 'Law enforcement', 'Police']","WASHINGTON – US President Donald Trump said on Jan 14 he would cut off federal funding in February for any state that includes sanctuary cities, expanding his attacks on mostly Democratic-run cities following days of chaotic clashes on the streets of Minneapolis. Mr Trumps vow, which he made on social media, repeated comments he first made during a speech in Detroit on Jan 13, when he said he would halt payments starting on Feb 1 to any state that had sanctuary cities, which limit local authorities cooperation with federal immigration officers. Any such effort would undoubtedly be challenged in court. A federal judge in August blocked a previous attempt to freeze funding for more than 30 sanctuary jurisdictions unless they cooperated with his immigration crackdown. Mr Trumps declaration came amid escalating tensions in Minneapolis, a week after a USimmigration officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, in her car. The Trump administration has dispatched more than 2,000 federal officers to the city despite fierce objections from Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat. Agents appear to be conducting roving sweeps and arresting people without warrants, based on resident accounts and videos. Reuters journalists have documented scores of armed agents carrying weapons through the icy streets of residential neighbourhoods, wearing military-style camouflage gear and masks that cover their faces and often met by residents blowing whistles and shouting at the officers. On occasion, the agents have smashed car windows and pulled people from their vehicles, videos show. Some have confronted non-white US citizens, demanding to see their identification before walking away, drawing angry jeers and accusations of racism from bystanders. The agents have used chemical irritants on protesters, sometimes firing orange pepper spray into faces at close range or igniting flash-bang grenades near groups in the street. The US Department of Homeland Security has defended against allegations of misconduct by agents, saying they have increasingly been subject to assaults while trying to find and detain immigration violators. DHS also has rejected allegations of racial profiling, saying arrests are based on reasonable suspicion that individuals lack legal immigration status. In 2025, the department won a Supreme Court ruling allowing a persons ethnicity to be a relevant factor alongside others in deciding if agents have sufficient cause to stop and question someone. Immigration officers have also arrested US citizens for allegedly disrupting enforcement. Groups of agents have chased protesters, including at least one dressed in a giraffe costume, before wrestling them to the ground to detain them. Two US citizen friends, Mr Brandon Siguenza and Ms Patty OKeefe, told local NBC affiliate KARE that they were arrested by ICE agents after following federal officers in Ms OKeefes car on Jan 11. In an incident last week, two US citizens were arrested at a Target store in the suburb of Richfield, including a 17-year-old employee, according to news reports. A DHS spokesperson said the employee had assaulted an officer. But a video of the encounter showed the employee insulting officers with an expletive and then running away as he was chased and tackled inside the store vestibule. Federal immigration officers also have arrested refugees in Minnesota with active legal status, according to resettlement groups. The nonprofit World Relief said dozens of legal refugees in the state, including children, had been arrested over the weekend and detained as part of a Trump effort to re-vet refugees who entered under Mr Trumps Democratic predecessor, Mr Joe Biden. These are innocent children and families who fled the worst wars and persecution imaginable, World Relief President Myal Greene said. Ms Beth Oppenheim, CEO of HIAS, another resettlement group, said the refugees taken into custody had not yet obtained permanent residence, and many were brought to detention centers in Texas, far from their homes. These people are here on legal status having been fully vetted extensively by our government, she said. When asked about the arrests of legal refugees, DHS referred to allegations of fraud against members of the Somali community in Minnesota. The Trump administration will not stand idly by as the U.S. immigration system is weaponised by those seeking to defraud the American people, a DHS spokesperson said. Mr Trump has zeroed in on the fraud allegations in recent months,calling Somali immigrants in Minnesota garbageand saying he wants them out of the country. Administration officials have sought to tie the crackdown in Minneapolis to the scandal. The president did not specify which states would face funding cuts under his threatened action, but the US Justice Department published a list of sanctuary jurisdictions in August that are located in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Nearly 160 million people live in those states, just under half of the US population. Mr Trump, a Republican, has argued that large-scale surges in Democratic-led cities are necessary because the cities do not sufficiently cooperate with immigration enforcement. Mr Trump and other administration officials have defended the Good shooting as self-defence and said she was trying to run the officer over with her car, despite video showing she was turning her wheels away from him as she drove forward. Mayor Frey and other Minnesota Democrats have rejected the governments account as false. Minnesota authorities have opened a criminal investigation into whether the agent who killed Good broke state law after they said the federal government withdrew from a joint investigation. At least six federal prosecutors resigned over a request from Justice Department leaders to investigate Ms Goods widow, Reuters has reported, deepening scrutiny of the way the department is conducting the investigation. On the morning of Jan 14, the Minnesota attorney generals office asked US District Judge Kate Menendez to issue a temporary order halting the Trump administrations surge in Minneapolis and the surrounding areas. The judge asked for additional responses from both sides before ruling.

The Government is committed to supporting Team Singapore athletes throughout their sporting journey. Sport Singapore (SportSG) provides comprehensive support throughout athletes careers, beginning from the early stages when they show potential, not just after significant wins at major games. Our tiered Sport Excellence Carding (spexCarding) system provides different levels of support upfront to help athletes achieve their potential. The spexScholarship provides full-time athletes with training, coaching, bespoke sport science and funding support to pursue success at the Asian and world levels. We recently introduced the spexPotential programme and established the High Performance Sport Institute to ensure more seamless support as our athletes progress from youth to adults. We have continuously enhanced our athlete support schemes over the years, including increased stipends and Central Provident Fund top-ups for spexScholars, and the spexEducation Undergraduate Scholarship to help athletes pursue both sport and academic aspirations. Non-full-time athletes also receive support through spexGLOW (Grant for Loss of Wages), which compensates them for income lost during major games preparation. All spexCarded athletes have access to sport science, sport medicine and athlete life management services. Collectively, these initiatives provide our athletes with certainty of support and development opportunities. SportSG also supports the broader sporting ecosystem through grants to over 50 national sports associations (NSAs) covering organisational operations, outreach programmes, training facilities and long-term planning. These grants invest in coaching expertise, cutting-edge training equipment, and opportunities to compete at top-level competitions locally and overseas. Building a sporting nation requires a collective effort. The Major Games Award Programme, administered by the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), provides monetary rewards for athletes who win medals at major games. SNOC determines reward structures in consultation with sponsors based on factors such as the level of competition and frequency of the games. The Government also matches donations raised by NSAs through the One Team Singapore Fund, while athletes not supported by existing grants or funding support may apply to the Athletes Inspire Fund. We encourage more private sector partnerships to support Team Singapore athletes pursuit of sporting excellence.

Forum: Normalise listing of caregiving roles on CVs,"Jan 15, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 15, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Employment', 'Caregivers/Caregiving']","We often say Singapore is built for families – yet we still expect people to work as if they have no family, and care for their family as if they have no job. This contradiction sits at the heart of why mother, father and caregiver almost never appear on curricula vitae (CVs), even though these roles shape us more profoundly than most job titles. People do not omit these roles because they inherently lack value. They omit them because workplaces have long treated caregiving as irrelevant, inconvenient or risky. This shapes what we choose to recognise as real work. The market rewards those who meet KPIs (key performance indicators), not those with responsibilities that come with sacrifice. Yet, caregiving is one of the most complex skill-building opportunities we have. It requires strategic prioritisation under pressure, stakeholder management, conflict resolution (sometimes with individuals who cannot articulate their needs), emotional intelligence, long-term planning and the ability to function through chronic uncertainty with no off switch. If this were a corporate role, it would be described as a multi-disciplinary executive position with high-stakes decision-making responsibilities. Caregiving is one of the most important forms of contribution and nation-building. For example, those who look after children are raising, supporting and sustaining the very people Singapore will rely on as workers, caregivers and leaders of the next generation. Recognising the value of caregiving will strengthen Singapore in many practical ways. It would help people balance work and family without fear of penalty, encourage more Singaporeans to start families or have more children, reduce strain on caregivers, improve workplace retention and build a more empathetic, resilient workforce. Singapores Workplace Fairness Act already prohibits discrimination based on caregiving responsibilities. The natural next step is to normalise listing caregiving roles on CVs – and to treat them as legitimate experiences, not liabilities. If we want a family-friendly nation, we must ensure people never feel they have to hide the very roles that strengthen our social fabric and build our future.

It was rightly pointed out that seniors may only visit a dentist if they experience an issue. In fact, among older adults, cost concerns, poor dental education and awareness, dental fear and the location of facilities have often been barriers to the utilisation of dental services. There have been improvements in geriatric dental education, research and service costs. For example, the Oral Health Education Programme trains non-dental healthcare professionals like caregivers in nursing homes to deliver basic oral healthcare and identify common dental conditions. There is also an increased emphasis on geriatric dental care in clinics, an increase in geriatric dental research and higher subsidies under the CHAS scheme. However, we still do not see a significant increase in dental visits. It seems that even though long-term programmes are being looked into, there is room for additional intervention. Providing basic dental education to domestic helpers who are caregivers for seniors in their homes could help bring increased dental awareness and provide emotional support to the seniors. The seniors would be able to freely express their concerns and symptoms to their caregivers, who in turn could help provide motivation and support to the older adults. There could also be regular dental camps conducted in community centres to screen older adults. With these interventions at the grassroots level, more seniors will understand the importance of their oral health and regular dental visits.

Playing the one-point, winner-takes-all first round against 24-year-old Australian Petar Jovic, Chou did not manage to get a hit of the ball at the famed Rod Laver Arena when his opponent hit an ace to the singers right. One point is all it takes in the One Point Slam, an exhibition tournament that has tennis amateurs and pros facing off, meaning Chou did not get to show off the fruit of his labour from practising with 20-time grand slam champion Roger Federer in Shanghai. Chou sportingly applauded and congratulated Jovic for his winning serve, before throwing into the crowd the shades he wore on the court, much to the delight of the two women who were able to collect the spoils of his defeat. His pre-tournament comments proved prescient. Its a one-point game, so I could be knocked out without even touching the ball, the Taiwanese star, 46,had said whenherevealed he would be participating. He had also asked fans not to travel to Melbourne for the competition, where matches could last less than a minute. Chou, a singer-songwriter more frequently seen behind a piano, is also an accomplished tennis player who often posts videos of himself hitting long rallies on court. He reportedly took up the sport to play with his son Romeo, a budding tennis player at the age of seven. He had earlier stolen the spotlight from many of the other tennis pros like top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz and Australian Open defending champion Jannik Sinner before the match, with his fans carrying posters into the arena to encourage him. His opponent Jovic quipped that Chous the most famous guy in the stadium. Joanna Garland, also representing Taiwan, had a longer run in the tournament, beating stars like Alex Zverev, Nick Kyrgios and Maria Sakkari before eventually losing the final to Australian and Sydney native Jordan Smith, who walked away with A$1 million (S$860,600).",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/jay-chou-draws-cheers-at-australian-open-one-point-slam-before-swift-first-round-defeat

Artist Lawrence Lek sends self-driving cars to therapy with Guanyin in new exhibition,"Jan 14, 2026, 03:35 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 06:03 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a45e3aa6adb8357684a69245dfb15ab954894f7bd156ca26613b49ceaf48a588,London-based artist Lawrence Leks exhibition NOX: Confessions Of A Machine is on at the ArtScience Museum from Jan 23 to April 19.ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH,"['Singapore Art Week', 'Visual arts', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'Marina Bay Sands', 'ArtScience Museum']","SINGAPORE – London-based artist Lawrence Leks upcoming exhibition conjures a rehabilitation centre – not for deviant humans, but for sentient self-driving vehicles which burn out and are sent for therapy with the mental health chatbot Guanyin, named after the goddess of mercy. This might sound like hardcore science fiction, but the 43-year-old thinks his world resembles the corporate logic of well-being today. Just like some companies have perks for their employees – massages at work, team-building activities to make people enjoy work more – what if you had a case where you had a super-intelligent self-driving car you forced to work 24/7 and the company created a mental health app for the car? NOX: Confessions Of A Machine – to be held at the ArtScience Museum from Jan 23 to April 19 as part of Singapore Art Week – invites visitors to step into the rehabilitation centre in a work that blends role-playing video game, music and architecture. Lek, who flew in to Singapore from London, spoke to The Straits Times at the museum ahead of the exhibitions installation and opening. Named in 2024 by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in artificial intelligence (AI), Lek is at the forefront of fleshing out speculative narratives about automations effects. The premise of NOX is especially timely asSingapore started trialling driverless shuttle services in Punggol on Jan 12, with plans to deploy between 100 and 150 self-driving vehicles by end-2026. In 2019, Lek staged a work titled 2065 at the Singapore Biennale, imagining a post-work society where people spend all their leisure time playing video games. That same year, he released a feature-length sci-fi musical AIDOL, about a fading idol who enlists an AI songwriter to mount a comeback. Both read as prescient today in the age of doomscrolling and new AI tools. Leks work, which premiered at the LAS Art Foundation in Berlin in 2023, has since travelled the world and makes its South-east Asian premiere in Singapore. He says: In each of these places where the project is shown, the car means a very different thing. In Germany, the car is a cultural object that has a relation to a local industry, population and society. In some places like Singapore, a car is a super high-end luxury item. In Los Angeles, a car is a complete necessity to function in society. But it is the first time that NOX and Guanyin (Confessions Of A Former Chatbot) are being shown together, and Lek hopes this will create multiple entry points for audiences to experience the perspectives of both the caregiver and the sentient car. The work is presented in collaboration with Farsight Corporation. This is a fictional Anglo-Chinese technology conglomerate Lek invented in 2017 which he has since legally registered as a real company. It is part of his work as a method artist which has informed how he thinks of the company as a non-human entity with certain rights and liabilities. Of course, Singapore being founded by a company is also an interesting thing, notes the artist, who was born to Malaysian-Chinese parents and spent his childhood in several Asian cities, including Singapore. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles, representing the British East India Company, established Singapore as a British trading post. Lek believes that art can be instructive for tech companies. When I realised that big, well-funded companies take video games very seriously, I thought, what if they took fine art very seriously as a field of human work worth studying? After NOX, Lek – who sees his work as part of an expanding cinematic universe – wants to venture further into the future. His next series, which he is calling Death Drive, gets even more existential than psychotherapy for automobiles. The idea of a fixed life and identity is really strange. If youre a self-driving car, what sense of mortality would there be?

Focus to an art hotel to a $10,000 prize","Jan 14, 2026, 03:35 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 06:29 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7c777a4f77a9aec1ebf0b91c018ff8cb466531d839629eeec2fdddd54f929bb6,"Filipino artist Elmer Borlongans paper works in coffee and ink, presented by gallery Ames Yavuz, at Art SG 2025.PHOTO: ART SG","['Art fairs/Art market', 'Exhibitions', 'Visual arts', 'Marina Bay Sands']","SINGAPORE – Art SG fair director Shuyin Yangs preparations for the annual mega fair begin almost immediately after each editions conclusion. Just two weeks after Art SG 2025, she was back on the road. Among her first excursions was to Shanghai to see the inaugural staging of the Wan Hai Hotel – an itinerant art experience by Rockbund Art Museum that she invited to Singapore as part of Art SG 2026. Then, in Hampi, she huddled with Singapore artist Robert Zhao in the Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary as bears licked ghee and honey around her. The India trip cemented partnerships with institutions there for a new platform highlighting South Asian art, sponsored by automotive manufacturer TVS Motor. Zhao is presenting some of his works at art non-profit organisation The Institutums booth at the fair. Ms Yang tells The Straits Times: Because we are a hub, we touch so many regions. We connect with South Asia, on to East Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the broader Asia-Pacific. The art fair cant be an island, so we need to form these meaningful connections. Over 100 galleries from more than 30 countries and territories have signed up for the fourth edition at Marina Bay Sands – a comparable number with the past two editions. The anchor event of Singapore Art Week (SAW) runs from Jan 22 to 25, and is presented by multinational investment bank UBS. The 2026 edition boasts a slew of new initiatives that hopes to differentiate Art SG in an increasingly crowded Asian art fair landscape. Wan Hai Hotel: Singapore Strait will draw visitors into a world of video programmes, installations and performances at The Warehouse Hotel, and the TVS initiative is a three-year project that includes a keynote lecture and a South Asian exhibition space in Art SG. But the biggest change is the collapsing of S.E.A. Focus into Art SG,which made headlines in September. For seven editions, S.E.A. Focus was a separate exhibition of South-east Asian artists, which moved from Gillman Barracks to Tanjong Pagar Distripark, run by print and paper gallery and workshop STPI. The National Arts Council announced it would be taken over by Art SG to help grow South-east Asian art on a global scale, though it will retain its distinctive brand. Ms Yang, who advocated for this inclusion, says: S.E.A. Focus has been an amazing and meaningful platform, and it is at that point in time when it should be scaled up to reach broader audiences. Against fears that this could dilute S.E.A. Focus uniqueness, Ms Yang believes the re-invention will benefit both platforms. Now that they are under one roof, we can share audiences with single-ticket access. Were able to present a more complete narrative of South-east Asia. We want all the collectors to circulate through and then make the assessment on whats the most interesting and relevant for their own collections. Ms Yangs work to grow Art SG in the shadow of the pandemic culminates in an exciting guest list in 2026. These include the influential Tate patrons group, which supports Britains Tate galleries. The French Embassy is flying in curators from Paris Palais de Tokyo and arts centre LUMA Arles, while Shanghais Rockbund Art Museum brings a coterie of its own patrons. The director of Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Mr Michael Govan, is visiting Singapore to kick-start the museums acquisition for a permanent South-east Asia collection. Hong Kong non-profit Para Site, one of Asias most active independent art spaces, is hosting its first patrons event at the Wan Hai Hotel project. The project takes its name from a motel in Penang and evokes the borderless global networks of Chinatowns. More than 20 artists have been invited to show work related to oceans, rivers and migration, including Singapore artist Ming Wongs Bloody Marys Bar at the hotel bar and Malaysian artist Hoo Fan Chons fish station. These can be experienced in the hotels reception area, restaurant, bar and corridors over 10 days from morning to midnight and are open to non-hotel guests. Rockbund Art Museums executive director X Zhu-Nowell, who conceptualised the project, says: When we turned to Singapore, it became clear that it needed a different vocabulary. The Singapore Strait is not just a passage, it is also a dense zone shaped by shipping, finance, labour migration, surveillance and extraction. Singapore Art Week moves at a fast and overwhelming pace that can sometimes feel almost transactional. Wan Hai Hotel offers a different rhythm. The project deliberately creates conditions for slower encounters. Mr John Tung remains curator for S.E.A. Focus and has assembled 16 participating galleries under the theme of The Humane Agency. He promises that the platforms curatorial rigour has not been diminished with the move to Marina Bay Sands. Visitors can look forward to new works but also pieces already significant in South-east Asian art history. Titanic figures like Indonesian artist Arahmaiani and the Philippines Imelda Cajipe-Endaya are balanced with younger names like Filipino artist Nicole Coson. Singapore artist Tang Da Wus prerequisite for being included was that he had to be shown together with younger artists. I didnt need to be blackmailed, Mr Tung, who says his curation has been incredibly price-blind, jokes. The common refrain Ive heard is that S.E.A. Focus is a barometer of practices in the region, and you cannot be a good barometer if your sample size is exceedingly skewed. Referencing Americas capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro on Jan 3, he says: 2025 was a traumatic year on a global level and 2026 is off to an even worse start. I wanted to put out there something that could be a beacon of light that not only recognises the situation we are in, but also gives focus as to what we could do to make it better. Artists are essentially trying to communicate a more noble path forward. Ms Yang has worked to add a third art cluster in the River Valley area in addition to Tanjong Pagar Distripark and Gillman Barracks. There will be a map, with dining options marked out, helping visitors navigate the area that contains the Wan Hai Hotel project, STPIs inaugural The Print Show & Symposium, Tanoto Art Foundations first exhibition at New Bahru, Kim Associations presentation of Chinese artist Shuang Li, Singapore artist Dawn Ngs solo at the Singapore Repertory Theatre black box and JW Projects show of Shanghai artist Ge Hui. The cherry on top for Art SG 2026 is a new US$10,000 (S$12,900) Art SG Futures Prize presented by UBS to an outstanding emerging artist featured in the fairs young galleries section. Ms Yang says her work has been helped by exciting developments in South-east Asia, which add to Singapores allure as the regions gateway. Many international visitors are taking the chance to fly on to the ongoing Thailand Biennale in Phuket or the much-hyped private museum Dib Bangkok that opened in late 2025. People like to compare different countries, she says of this rich hinterland for Singapore. But honestly, we are all part of the same ecosystem. We all rise together.

Worlds most influential artist Ibrahim Mahama holds solo show at Singapore Art Week,"Jan 14, 2026, 03:35 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 06:19 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/4f976a3ad2c28a56ee43081e1a069f509e2de2c56750677e1bcf7152f798745b,Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama topped ArtReview magazines annual power list in 2025.PHOTO: COURTESY OF IBRAHIM MAHAMA,"['Singapore Art Week', 'Visual arts', 'Exhibitions']","SINGAPORE – The worlds most influential figure in the art world, Ibrahim Mahama, is sitting on the floor of his studio in his home town of Tamale, Ghana. He harbours no airs, and maybe even looks a little sleepy as he chats with The Straits Times over Zoom. To anyone who asks about his topping of ArtReview magazines annual power list in 2025, his go-to reply has been that it was humbling. Gesturing to his surroundings, he says: Where I live is a village. Were surrounded by farms and children whose parents can barely pay for them to go to school. Ibrahim calls such external validation part of the paradox of the art world where, to make the kind of socially conscious, community-oriented work he is known for, he has had to hold shows in the Western Hemisphere to generate capital. Now that Ive been named No. 1, people have to pay me my money, he jokes. One of the first events Ibrahim is attending after receiving his accolade in December is Singapore Art Week, which kicks off on Jan 22. Under the auspices of non-profit Art Outreach and The Pierre Lorinet Collection, he has made new works for a solo show titled Digging Stars, on at Gillman Barracks from Jan 16 to Feb 8. The 39-year-old will also conduct a performance lecture at Art Outreachs symposium on Jan 24 at Marina Bay Sands. This will be centred on his obsession with excavating materials and making meaning of their residues. He says: Its not a difficult thing at all, but it requires effort. It doesnt make any sense to do it every day, but we artists constantly dwell in the realm of stupidity and senselessness. Its not like medicine, where it can save a human body. Art starts from failure, but somehow the body is renewed in a way that it becomes a lot more sensitive to the world. Though Ibrahim confesses he has not had much contact with South-east Asia, the material that made his name – the jute fibre sack – is largely manufactured in the region. He first used it to engulf a corridor artery at the Venice Biennale in 2015 and his ambitions have only expanded. Since then, he and his collaborators have stitched tens of thousands of fragments of the coarse and tattered material into giant structures enveloping buildings, monuments and gallery spaces like the National Theatre of Ghana and the Porta Venezia, or Venice Gate, in Milan, Italy. Recalling his undergraduate years, Ibrahim cites a professor who drew comparisons between Ghana and Singapore and Malaysia as aspiring nations of a class gaining independence in the 1950s and 1960s. That is a now forgotten history. Ghana was sending engineers to Singapore and Malaysia, and certain intellectuals from there came to Ghana, he says. It was all about expanding our economic capabilities and reinforcing our sovereignty. Theres a sharp contrast now in terms of how developed Singapore is. When he first paid attention to the ubiquitous jute sacks transporting vegetables, cocoa and rice while visiting a friend in Burkina Faso in 2011, it was not the bags enmeshing in systems of labour and production but their aesthetics that first enticed him. I was very curious about the forms they took, he says. I started collecting specifically the ones that charcoal centres used – with the scars, the patina and the dark stains. I realised there was something that the material did when you laid it against a building. Meaning came after and easily. The scale of his projects meant he needed collaborators, and who better than the women most familiar with them in Ghanian markets? He also got audiences to sew the material, like in Syntagma Square in Athens, Greece, in 2017, inverting global systems of extraction. The same idea can take on severely different meanings depending on time and place, in the way the works of fellow wrappers Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whom he is frequently compared with, might not. He says of his project in Milans Porta Venezia: Those two towers were the gates into the city of Milan back in the mediaeval period, and you paid your taxes when you entered. 2019 was during the height of the refugee crisis, and a lot of people didnt want to accept them. But the material speaks of global transactions, the commodities we consume and the relationships those create. The bag doesnt forget and records what humanity neglects. There are unexpected parallels between his new works for Singapore and South-east Asias history. There will still be some jute, but he has also explored rubber residues taken from Ghanas defunct factories, which were built during the countrys drive for self-reliance in the 1960s but later neglected. Pressures under colonialism made Malaysia and Singapore the major rubber exporters in the 20th century, at one point producing half the worlds supply. A lot of the works are quite beautiful, he promises of his Brutalist creations. Ibrahim frowns at the idea of artists from the Global South moving to Western metropoles after gaining global recognition. In Tamale, he has plugged his earnings into building cultural centres such as the Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art, the Red Clay Studio and Nkrumah Volini, attracting ordinary families, sometimes from faraway villages. Twenty kids pack themselves onto a single tricycle, precariously wobbling to see the fantasy ground where they will get their first exposure to art. We produce cocoa in Ghana, but a lot of farmers have never eaten chocolate, he says. We cannot forget what art represents. Art has always been about the quest for new freedoms. Im making work in museums all around the world, but everything I have intellectually and materially came from here. What about these peoples encounter with the work, not just at the point of making?

The case involves two boys who were appearing on a television drama that he was producing in New Mexico. Busfield, 68, went to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Albuquerque and will be booked on a warrant that was signed Friday by a Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court judge in Albuquerque. The warrant said that Busfield had been charged with two counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and one count of child abuse. Stanton Stein, a civil lawyer for Busfield, said his client had voluntarily appeared before the New Mexico authorities after travelling across the country to confront these false and deeply troubling allegations. He is innocent and is determined to clear his name, Stein said in a statement. Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesperson for the Albuquerque Police Department, said earlier Jan 13 that the department was working with federal marshals to take Busfield into custody because he was not in New Mexico. A police affidavit said the offences took place in 2022. At that time, Busfield was an executive producer and actor on the crime drama The Cleaning Lady (2022 to 2025). The police began investigating him in 2025 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital, where staff members requested a sexual-abuse investigation and said it appeared the boys were being groomed, the affidavit said. Stein said that after the womans son was terminated from the show, she had vowed to seek revenge against Busfield. What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing, Stein said. Warner Bros. Television, which produced the show, said in a statement Tuesday that the health safety of its cast and crew was always its top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have processes in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action, the company said. We are aware of the current charges against Mr Busfield and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement in a timely manner. Busfield won an Emmy Award for best supporting actor in a drama series for his work in ABCs Thirtysomething, which aired for four years beginning in 1987. He also portrayed a journalist on political drama The West Wing (1999 to 2006). He is married to American actress Melissa Gilbert. The affidavit said Busfield would invite the boys family to gatherings off the set, with his wife buying Christmas gifts to foster closeness. Gilberts publicist said in a statement that Gilbert was honouring a request from her husbands lawyers not to speak publicly about the case while it unfolds. During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment, the statement said. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.

Hour Glass co-founder Jannie Chans $18.9 million debt dispute sent to trial,"Jan 15, 2026, 07:14 AM","Jan 15, 2026, 07:17 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/79c3ac78d2a6832d2fb28231d7bf475b6d0ce3ee5c22e48530f959a001d1cc0f,The High Court has sent a $18.9 million dispute over alleged improper loans by bankrupt businesswoman Jannie Chans coffee-trading company to trial.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG,"['Singapore courts', 'Bankruptcy/Liquidation', 'Singapore companies', 'The Business Times']","SINGAPORE - The Appellate Division of the High Court has sent a $18.9 million dispute over alleged improper loans by bankrupt businesswoman Jannie Chans coffee-trading company to trial. This hands the Hour Glass co-founder a win in her years-long legal battle with creditors. The ruling, delivered on Jan 7, sets aside an earlier High Court decision that had admitted $18.9 million in debt claims against Ms Chans bankruptcy estate. The three-judge panel found that the High Court erred in deciding the matter based on affidavits and documents alone, given that there were significant disputes of fact that could be resolved only through the cross-examination of witnesses. The judges found that the allegations that Ms Chan breached her fiduciary duties are serious accusations, and the available evidence before us does not appear sufficient to establish such dishonesty and a lack of good faith. Having considered the parties written and oral submissions, we are of the view that the proper course of action is for us to order a trial before the judge to determine the admissibility of (the two sums claimed). The claims stem from Ms Chans role as a director of Timor Global Pte Ltd (TGPL), a Singapore-incorporated coffee-trading company that was wound up in 2018. Ms Chan, now 80, was the sole shareholder of TGPL and held between 60 and 70 per cent of the shares in a related company in Timor-Leste, known in court documents only as TL. The claims involve two main sums: $15.8 million as well as represented receivables allegedly owed by TL to TGPL; and US$2.3 million (S$3 million) related to the sales proceeds from coffee beans sold by TGPL in 2008 that were allegedly paid directly by customers to the Timor-Leste entity instead. These two sums are being claimed by Fulcrum Distressed Partners Ltd (FDPL), which purchased the debt claims from the liquidators of TGPL. FDPL argued that Ms Chan breached her fiduciary duties by allowing these transfers and failing to pursue their recovery, causing losses to TGPL and ultimately, its creditors. In February 2025, a High Court judge accepted these claims after Ms Chans private trustee in bankruptcy, Yit Chee Wah, had initially rejected them. This slapped an additional $18.9 million onto the claims against Ms Chans bankruptcy estate, which already included more than $4 million owed to licensed moneylender SME Care. One key issue was whether the $15.8 million were genuine debts under the joint-venture arrangements between TGPL, TL and another firm, Intraco Trading. The judges noted that the payments from TGPL to TL in 2007 roughly coincided with advance payments from Intraco meant for TL under the agreement, suggesting that the funds may have been merely channelled through TGPL. If Intraco was merely using TGPL as a conduit to make the 2007 payments to TL, then there can be no issue of any breach of fiduciary duty, the judges said. Ms Chan, other TGPL directors, or staff members could have shed some light on the issues regarding these funds had they been cross-examined and asked to give evidence, the judges noted. The judges also raised concerns about the reliability of TGPLs management accounts, which showed substantially different receivables from TL compared with audited financial statements. In 2008, management accounts recorded $16.9 million as receivables from TL, but audited accounts showed only $7.1 million – a difference of $9.8 million that auditors had written down. The judges also highlighted contradictions in Ms Chans own statements. While she admitted in earlier court proceedings that TGPL had lent money to TL, she later claimed in affidavits that she was merely a financial investor with no hands-on involvement in TGPLs operations, leaving management to fellow directors Bobby Lay and Tan Tjo Tek. Ms Chan had also stated that because she was travelling 90 per cent of the time, her staff had access to her digital signature, which they used when necessary. Ms Chans statements on affidavit, where she disclaimed that she oversaw the operations of TGPL or any management control over TGPL, might suggest that she would not be able to explain why the 2007 payments were made to TL, the judgment stated. The judges said that these contradictions ought to have been resolved through the cross-examination of witnesses, including Ms Chan herself, Mr Lay and Mr Tan. Without sufficient evidence to show that Ms Chan caused or authorised the disbursement of the TL sum to TL or that she instructed the customers to transfer the finished goods sum to TL, Ms Chan cannot be held in breach of her fiduciary duties in respect of those very acts.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/hour-glass-co-founder-jannie-chans-18-9-million-debt-dispute-sent-to-trial

The S&P 500 bank index dropped, with shares of Wells Fargo down 4.6 per cent after the company missed fourth-quarter profit expectations. Citigroup and Bank of America shares also fell, even after the companies beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter profit. Financials including the banks, which were up sharply in 2025, have fallen this week amid concerns overUS President Donald Trumps proposed capon credit-card interest rates, which JPMorgan executives warned could squeeze consumers and hurt financial sector profits. After a nice run, and so-so or mediocre earnings, youre seeing profit-taking and consolidation in the banks, said Mr Michael ORourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. Generally speaking, people are still optimistic on the group. In addition, he said, the credit-card cap plan may never go forward, but none of the bank executives could rule it out. In tech, he said, investors are looking to rotate out of expensive megacaps and into value and more defensive names. S&P 500 financials fell along with the S&P 500 technology sector while more defensive groups including consumer staples rose. The small-cap Russell 2000 index, which has been sharply outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 so far this year, hit a record closing high, along with the S&P 500 industrials index.

Shares of Broadcom and Fortinet dropped after Reuters reported, citing three people briefed on the matter, that Chinese authorities have told domestic companies to stop using cybersecurity software made by more than a dozen firms from the US and Israel. On the flip side, energy shares rose, with oil prices settling higher amid worries about Iranian supply disruptions. Oil eased later in the day. Investors also digested data earlier on Jan 14 showing producer prices in the US matched forecasts in November but that retail sales topped expectations. A report on Jan 13 showed December consumer prices rose as projected. Interest rates are widely expected to hold steady through the first half of the year, including at the Federal Reserves January meeting, with traders pricing in at least two cuts before year-end, according to LSEG data.

MPA offers more LNG bunkering licences to address growing demand for cleaner marine fuels,"Jan 14, 2026, 02:50 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:14 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/36e4869398d41a4c5c5237ad667590e74a8b0048439f8da07afd9dfe660d3d77,Industry experts say that demand for LNG bunkering has grown significantly over the past few years.ST PHOTO: BRIAN TEO,"['Oil and gas sector', 'Fossil fuels', 'Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore', 'Maritime and shipping', 'Environmental issues']","SINGAPORE -The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) is offering permits to existing and new applicants to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel in the Port of Singapore. Firms that obtain the licence will be required to implement end-to-end LNG bunkering supply arrangements, MPA said on Jan 14. These arrangements will include securing LNG supply, demand planning, cargo transfer operations, storage and safe handling of LNG, as well as the sale, supply and delivery of LNG fuel to vessels in Singapore – one of the worlds largest bunkering ports. Industry experts say demand for LNG bunkering has grown significantly over the past few years. The demand is driven not only by regulatory mandates – on reductions in greenhouse gas intensity for fuels used in shipping – but also by the growth of the LNG dual-fuel fleet, which consists of ships designed to run on both LNG and conventional marine fuels. According to Norwegian classification society and risk consultant DNVs Alternative Fuels Insight platform, 642 LNG-powered vessels were in operation in 2025 worldwide. Of these, 169 were delivered in 2024, the highest delivery of such vessels ever. The growth in demand is expected to continue, with 264 new orders for LNG-fuelled vessels placed in 2024 – also a record and more than double the number of orders placed in 2023. Experts believe the total addressable market for LNG pathway fuels – which include LNG, bio-LNG and e-methane – will grow exponentially by the end of this decade. The LNG pathway fuels use LNGs established infrastructure to fuel ships, and they are increasingly recognised as a practical route to take the shipping industry to net-zero emissions. Singapores call for additional applications follows the recent updates to the Singapore LNG bunkering licensing framework and standards. They now include the provision of sea-based LNG reloading and the supply of liquefied bio-methane and e-methane in the Port of Singapore, the port regulator said. MPA on Jan 14 said the licensees are now required to own or charter at least one LNG bunker vessel (LBV) for the entire licence period. The LBV must be registered with the Singapore Registry of Ships and comply with MPAs Standards for Port Limit LNG Bunker Vessels, it said. To support international shippings decarbonisation efforts, applicants are also required to submit a proposal detailing their technical readiness to supply LNG fuels with lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, such as liquefied bio-methane and e-methane. The proposal should also cover intended supply pathways and sourcing arrangements. Applicants for the new licences are also required to outline measures to monitor and mitigate methane slip – which refers to the leakage of methane fuel – from LNG bunker vessels. The outline of measures should include vessel design features, operational practices, and monitoring or reporting approaches. The measures will be assessed as part of the licence evaluation process, said MPA. In July 2025, MPA conducted a large-scale chemical spill drill simulating a methanol leak, ahead of issuance of the first batch of methanol bunkering licences in November to Global Energy Trading, Golden Island, and PetroChina International (Singapore). The regulator on Jan 14 said that to further enhance Singapores LNG bunkering ecosystem, MPA and Enterprise Singapore, through the Singapore Standards Council, will upgrade the existing Technical Reference for LNG Bunkering (TR56) to a Singapore Standard (SS) in the second quarter of 2026. The new SS will update and strengthen the requirements under TR56, aligning them with Singapores broader bunkering standards and serving as a key reference for LNG bunkering licence applicants. MPA has also published the Standards for Port Limit LNG Bunker Vessels, developed in consultation with the industry, to ensure the safe operation of LNG bunker vessels in Singapore. These standards specify requirements for equipment, operational performance and efficiency of LNG bunker vessels. Singapores LNG ecosystem has developed fast since the opening of its first terminal in 2013 – making LNG the top fuel for power generation. The first Request for Proposal for LNG bunkering was launched in July 2015. In the same year, MPA announced a co-funding scheme to support the building of LNG-fuelled vessels. In May 2021, FueLNG – a joint venture between Keppel and Shell Eastern Petroleum – completed Singapores first bunkering of an LNG-fuelled oil tanker. Shell has become one of the biggest players in LNG trading and bunkering in Singapore after it completed the acquisition of Pavilion Energy from Temasek in April 2025. The other big names in LNG bunkering in Singapore are TotalEnergies Marine Fuels, BP, Vitol and Chevron.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/singapore-mpa-offers-more-lng-bunkering-licences-to-address-growing-demand-for-cleaner-marine-fuels

The Catalist-listed mining stock rose as much as 5.9 per cent to $1.25 in morning trade on Jan 14, and was up 3.4 per cent at $1.22 at 1.40pm. About eight million shares had changed hands. The counter closed 5.1 per cent higher at $1.24 on Jan 14. Spot gold, meanwhile, rose 1.1 per cent to a new record high of US$4,639.42 an ounce on Jan 14. The precious metal has surged more than 60 per cent over the past year amid heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, including the Russia-Ukraine war, conflict in Gaza, and policy uncertainty stemming from US President Donald Trumps tariffs. The latest spikes have been driven by Mr Trumps capture of Venezuelas leader, his renewed threats to annex Greenland, and violent protests in Iran that could lead to a toppling of the Islamic regime there. Other precious metals have also rallied. Silver broke above US$90 an ounce for the first time on Jan 14, while platinum and palladium both jumped more than 4 per cent. CNMC Goldmine in August posted record earnings of US$15.8 million (S$20.4 million) for the first half of the 2025 financial year, a 256.1 per cent jump from a year earlier. Revenue for the six months ended June 2025 surged 78 per cent to US$52.8 million, driven by higher gold production and stronger selling prices. In comparison, the group earned US$9.8 million for the whole of the 2024 financial year. Its previous earnings record was US$12.2 million in the 2014 financial year. Mr Zavier Wong, market analyst at trading platform eToro, said CNMC Goldmine Holdings share price strength appears to be tied to a broader shift in global sentiment towards gold. Gold has been well bid for months, but the latest bout of geopolitical uncertainty and persistent rate ambiguity has sharpened investor focus on the metal again... For a small, pure-play producer like CNMC, that tends to feed through quickly into their share price, given how tightly it tracks movements in gold, he said. CNMCs earlier record earnings have definitely helped anchor confidence that higher gold prices can translate into real cash flow for them – if geopolitical risks remain sticky and central bank demand stays firm, golds support looks intact, and companies like CNMC are likely to remain on investors radar. Ms Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, noted that golds ongoing strength, underpinned by safe-haven demand and positive flows into precious metals, continues to support mining stocks. She added that CNMCs expanded processing capacity at its Sokor operation in Kelantan, Malaysia, remains a key growth driver. Ms Sachdeva also noted that CNMCs share register is relatively retail-heavy, with individual investors and insiders collectively holding the majority stake, while institutional presence remains limited. This can contribute to heightened price volatility, a common feature in smaller, sector-specific stocks, but does not, in itself, indicate fundamental weakness, she said. In short, while the near-term surge is largely sentiment-driven by the bullion rally, CNMCs earnings trajectory and asset expansion lend credibility to the uptrend, even as the stock remains a small-cap play rather than a large institutional favourite.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/cnmc-goldmine-shares-shine-amid-soaring-gold-prices

The move cast uncertainty over the future of US luxury fashion, though the retailer said early on Jan 14 that its stores would remain open for now after it finalised a US$1.75 billion (S$2.3 billion) financing package and appointed a new chief executive officer. Former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck will replace Mr Richard Baker, who was the architect of the acquisition strategy that left Saks Global saddled with debt. Saks Fifth Avenue, the retail arm of Saks Global, listed US$1 billion to US$10 billion in assets and liabilities, according to court documents. The court process is meant to give the luxury retailer room to negotiate a debt restructuring with creditors or sell itself to a new owner to stave off liquidation. Failing that, the company may be forced to shutter. A retailer long loved by the rich and famous, from Gary Cooper to Grace Kelly, Saks fell on hard times after the pandemic, as competition from online outlets rose, and brands started selling items through their own storesmore frequently. The new financing deal would provide an immediate cash infusion of US$1 billion through a debtor-in-possession loan from an investor group, Saks Global said. Reuters earlier reported the loan was led by Pentwater Capital Management in Naples, Florida, and Boston-based Bracebridge Capital. Financing worth US$240 million would be available through an asset-backed loan provided by the companys asset-based lenders, according to Saks Global. The luxury retailer will have access to US$500 million of financing from the investor group once it successfully exits bankruptcy protection, expected later in 2026, the company added. A host of luxury brands were among the unsecured creditors, led by Chanel and Gucci owner Kering at about US$136 million and US$60 million, respectively, the court filing said. The worlds biggest luxury conglomerate, LVMH, was listed as an unsecured creditor at US$26 million. In total, Saks Global estimated that there were between 10,001 and 25,000 creditors. In 2024, Mr Baker had masterminded the takeover of Neiman Marcus by Canadas Hudsons Bay, which had owned Saks since 2013, and later spun off the US luxury assets to create Saks Global, bringing together three names that have defined American high fashion for over a century.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/saks-global-files-for-bankruptcy-after-neiman-marcus-takeover-leads-to-financial-collapse
Global EV sales growth likely to slow after 20% jump in rocky 2025: Research firm,"Jan 14, 2026, 01:06 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 02:38 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/de13dcbfaeabcc305476a2e679e9e57a9e4f6664094361d1397e584bc320f365,"BMI expects 23.9 million EVs will be sold globally in 2026, with growth accelerating in China but slowing in Europe and the rest of the world.PHOTO: AFP","['Electric and hybrid vehicles', 'Automobile sector', 'China', 'United States']","Gdansk, Poland- Global electric vehicle (EV) registrations grew 20 per cent in 2025 but are likely to lose pace in 2026, data showed on Jan 14, as a slowdown in China and a relaxation of electrification targets worldwide led in December to the smallest sales increase since February 2024. Monthly registrations of electric vehicles, including battery electric and plug-in hybrids, dropped further in North America after the end in October of an EV tax credit scheme in the US, consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) said. Radical policy shifts, includingUS President Donald Trumps U-turn on electrificationand a relaxation of emission standards in the European Union, shook the global EV market in 2025 into a virtually unrecognisable landscape, according to BMI data manager Charles Lester. Rising competition in Europe and cooling demand in China are likely to intensify the debate between electrification proponents who emphasise the need to curb planet-warming CO2 emissions, and carmakers who say a quick transition threatens jobs and profits. Global EV registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 6 per cent to almost 2.1 million units in December, reaching 20.7 million vehicles in 2025, the data showed. They were up 2 per cent in China to more than 1.3 million, the lowest year-on-year increase since February 2024, leading to a 17 per cent increase to 12.9 million units in 2025. The country produced 71 per cent of EVs sold worldwide. North American registrations fell 39 per cent in December to just over 100,000 cars sold, following similar declines in October and November at the end of US tax credits. They were down 4 per cent for whole of 2025. Europe was up 34 per cent in December to over 450,000 registrations and 33 per cent for 2025, while in the rest of the world sales were up 41 per cent to over 160,000 units in December, and 48 per cent for the year. BMI expects 23.9 million EVs will be sold globally in 2026, a 15.7 per cent increase, with growth sharply accelerating in China to 21 per cent and slowing in Europe and the rest of the world to 15 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively. It forecasts a sharper drop of 23 per cent in North America due to a 29 per cent slump in the US.

The tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada and feature 48 teams for the first time, attracted applications from fans in all 211 FIFA member countries and territories, the football governing body said in a statement. Each application was validated by unique credit card data, with fans submitting an average of 15 million ticket requests per day. Beyond the three host nations, the highest number of applications came from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. The most sought-after match was a group stage encounter between Colombia and Portugal in Miami on June 27. Half a billion ticket requests in just over a month is more than demand, its a global statement, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said. Fans will be notified of their application results by email no earlier than February 5. Where demand exceeds supply, tickets will be allocated through a random selection process, FIFA added. Unsuccessful applicants will have another chance to purchase tickets closer to the tournament during a last-minute sales phase on a first-come, first-served basis. FIFA also operates an official resale and exchange marketplace for eligible ticket holders, which aims to protect fans and is subject to federal and local regulations. The tournament starts on June 11 with Mexico facing South Africa in Mexico City. The final is on July 19 in New Jersey.

On a misty night at the Carlos Belmonte stadium, the energetic 17,000-strong crowd created an electric atmosphere as Albacete stunned the European powerhouses, who had sacked manager Xabi Alonso earlier in the week. Former Real defender Arbeloa, who was handed the reins in the wake of Alonsos dismissal, selected a largely second-string side and they struggled to impose themselves on their lowly opponents, while dense fog that shrouded large portions of the match added to the drama. Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo were among the absentees, alongside Thibaut Courtois and Aurelien Tchouameni. Arbeloa promoted right back David Jimenez and midfielder Jorge Cestero from the clubs Castilla reserve set-up, while fielding Vinicius Jr. as the focal point of the attack. The night was marred before kickoff, however, with fans outside the stadium targeting Vinicius with racist chants. Once the match began, the Brazilian was booed throughout and struggled to influence proceedings as Albacete double- and triple-marked him on the left wing. The hosts took the lead in the 42nd minute after a spell of pressure. A dangerous corner from Jose Lazo found Javier Villar at the near post, with the defender rising highest to head past Reals stand-in goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, sending the crowd into raptures. However, their joy was short-lived, as Real struck back just before halftime when a marauding Vinicius won a corner, which Arda Guler swung into the six-yard box. Dean Huijsens initial header was brilliantly saved by Albacete keeper Raul Lizoain, but Franco Mastantuono pounced on the rebound and smashed it home to level the score. REAL STRUGGLE TO BREAK DOWN HOSTS After the break, Real Madrid dominated possession but struggled to break down Albacetes disciplined five-man defence. The home side remained a constant threat on the counter-attack, and Reals Gonzalo Garcia missed a gilt-edged opportunity in the 70th minute, heading wide from close range. Albacete regained the lead in the 82nd minute after substitute Agus Medinas shot from the edge of the box forced a superb save from Lunin. From the resulting corner, Reals defence failed to clear their lines, allowing an unmarked Betancor to find the net with a venomous strike at the far post. Real Madrid thought they had rescued the tie in stoppage time when Gulers cross was met by Gonzalo, whose towering header beat Lizoain to make it 2-2. But as the visitors pressed for a late winner, they left themselves exposed at the back. Four minutes into added time, Jefte broke free on the counter-attack. His initial effort was blocked by Dani Carvajal, but the forward kept his composure, collected the rebound, and unleashed a sublime right-footed strike into the top corner to seal a shock victory for the hosts. Weve hit rock bottom; weve been knocked out by a second division team, Real captain Dani Carvajal told reporters. You have to face up to it when you lose, and thats what we have to do now. We, the players, are the ones ultimately responsible. Theres little else I can say. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/albacete-stun-real-madrid-in-thrilling-3-2-copa-del-rey-upset

Action Images via Reuters/Andrew BoyersREUTERS",['Surgery'],"SHEFFIELD, England, Jan 14 - Defending champion Niina Petrokina seized the lead in the womens short programme at the European Figure Skating Championships on Wednesday despite missing most of the season after undergoing Achilles tendon surgery in October. The Estonian delivered a gutsy, virtually flawless skate to score 70.61 points, putting her comfortably ahead of Nina Pinzarrone and Anna Pezzetta. It was a stunning comeback for an athlete who had been uncertain about being healthy enough to compete in Sheffield, the final international event for Europes Olympic-bound skaters before next months Milano Cortina Games. Belgiums Pinzarrone scored 64.97 to sit second heading into Fridays free skate, while Pezzetta of Italy was third with 64.85. Georgias Anastasiia Metelkina and Luka Berulava stormed to the top of the pairs short programme with a crisp skate that left the reigning champions trailing. The double world junior champions scored 75.96 points for their programme to Bolero, powered by side‑by‑side triple Salchows and a throw triple flip. Germanys reigning European champions Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin scored 74.81 points for second place heading into Thursdays free programme, losing marks when Fabienne Hase touched a hand down on their side-by-side triple Salchows. Their side-by-side spins were also not synchronised. Maria Pavlova and Alexei Sviatchenko of Hungary were third with 73.32. The Georgians superb skate -- which opened with Metelkina in a handstand while Berulava spun her by the feet -- came despite their late arrival in Sheffield on Tuesday evening due to a delay with their visas. Their only practice was on Wednesday morning. Metelkina complained about her 0400 GMT wake-up for hair and makeup, while Berulava got up at 0800. This is the difference between women and men in figure skating, a laughing Metelkina said, via an interpreter. World silver medallists Fabienne Hase and Volodin executed a breathtakingly low death spiral, with her head virtually grazing the ice, but they lacked synchronisation in their combination spin. Its a little bit sad about the spin, in the practice we always do it perfectly synchronised, Fabienne Hase said. And then in the competition, I dont know who is fast or slower, but the rhythm is not together anymore. But the rest of the elements were solid. There is a silver lining, they said, to sitting second heading into the free programme, since the skaters are seeded, with the short programme leaders taking the ice last. Its just nice to not skate last, to be honest, Fabienne Hase said. If you skate last, its always like 25, 30 minutes to wait, so at least a shorter wait time, which is pretty nice, to be honest.

Bayern came from a goal down to earn their sixth league win in the last seven matches and moved up to 47 points with a goal difference of +53. The previous best mark after 17 matches belonged to Pep Guardiolas Bayern from the 2013/14 season, also with 47 points but a goal difference of +35.

Inter move to 46 points, six ahead of both AC Milan, who are away to Como on Thursday, and Napoli. The home side were boosted by defending champions Napolis 0-0 draw with Parma earlier on Wednesday, but for a long time it looked like Inter would fail to take advantage. Inter laboured against a stubborn Lecce side before substitute Francesco Pio Esposito scored from a rebound with 12 minutes remaining for what could end up being a major turning point in this seasons title race. A great team victory, even the players who dont play as much are always ready to help the team, Inter midfielder Carlos Augusto told DAZN. The first half was complicated, but that was our own fault as we were too slow with the ball. We werent quite ourselves but you cant score five goals in every game. Ange-Yoan Bonny, in for the rested Lautaro Martinez, created an early chance for himself, dancing his way past three Lecce players in the area but his shot was parried away by Wladimiro Falcone at full-stretch. ESPOSITO TO THE RESCUE From an almost identical situation, Bonny, surrounded by the Lecce defenders, was awarded a penalty by the referee but a VAR check ruled that Danilo Veiga had played the ball. Inter huffed and puffed for the rest of the opening half, desperation pushing Henrikh Mkhitaryan to take a chance from distance, smashing his strike well over the bar and into the stands. Falcone punched away a Nicolo Barella header from close-range shortly after the break and easily gathered a shot from Andy Diouf as the hosts continued to struggle to open up a dogged Lecce defence. The loudest applause of the night came when Martinez was launched from the bench with less than 20 minutes remaining and the replacement played a large part in Inter finally finding a way through. Martinez had a volleyed effort parried away by Falcone and Esposito was quickest to react and slammed home the rebound to the relief of the home crowd.

At the head of the fleet, the MOD70 trimarans are putting on a breathtaking exhibition of extreme ocean racing. Argo and Zoulou are routinely tearing along in the high twenties and surging beyond 30 knots as the breeze builds. On board Argo, helms are rotated every 45 minutes, drivers stepping away with red, stinging eyes after wrestling with the jet-wash of relentless salt spray. As of Wednesday, Argo held a lead of around 50 nautical miles over Zoulou and lay just over 1,000 miles from the finish. At this relentless pace, the MOD70s are on course for a sub-five-day crossing - a staggering benchmark that underlines how far offshore multihull performance has advanced. Among the monohulls, Raven continues to assert her authority, leading on the water by nearly 200 nautical miles. On corrected time, the contest remains finely balanced. Palanad 4 currently leads overall under IRC handicapping, with James Nevilles Carkeek 45 Ino Noir roughly 80 nautical miles astern, separated by only five hours on corrected time. Maxitude is also in the race. Last night was rather busy, said navigator Xavier Bellouard. The sea became chaotic as the northerly swell fought the north-easterly chop. We beat our speed record at 21.7 knots. At the tail of the fleet but very much embodying the spirit of the race, Stimmy - the Finnish Sun Fast 3300 raced two-handed by Ari Huusela and Annika Paasikivi - still has more than 2,300 miles to sail. Huusela reports the boat is in fine shape, morale remains high and, just as importantly, fresh food is still on the menu. With no major technical issues reported and conditions aligning almost perfectly, the RORC Transatlantic Race is shaping up to be the fastest edition since its launch in 2014, with the first finishers expected in Antigua from Friday, January 16. The race is a biennial offshore sailing event organised by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, sending a mixed fleet of professional and amateur crews west across the Atlantic Ocean from Lanzarote in Spains Canary Islands to Antigua. The race covers some 3,000 nautical miles and is sailed under a range of handicap and class rules, allowing radically different yachts - from high-performance multihulls to powerful offshore monohulls - to compete on the same course. The event attracts a diverse international field that includes fully crewed racing yachts, double-handed teams and some of the most advanced ocean-racing designs in the sport. Competitors range from elite professionals - including Olympic sailors, Americas Cup veterans and round-the-world racers - to experienced Corinthian crews taking on one of offshore sailings classic passages, with victory decided both by elapsed time and by corrected time under handicap rules.

It was as much as Senegal deserved after they dominated the match, with Egypt, spearheaded by talisman Mohamed Salah, not having any shots at goal or even forcing a corner before they conceded. Senegal found it tough, however, to break down a resolute Egypt defence and it was only a fortuitous deflection that set up Manes chance. Yet his shot from the edge of the area was worthy of winning any match and sent Senegal through to take on either hosts Morocco or Nigeria in Sundays final. Lamine Camaras effort from the edge of the area was blocked but it fell to Mane nearby and he wasted no time bulleting the ball along the ground with a grass-cutting shot that gave Egypt goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy no chance. I was a bit lucky, you have to admit, because the ball came from nowhere, said Mane. It hit my stomach, it was well-positioned, and I instinctively took a first-time shot. Senegal probed throughout the game as they tried to force an opening, but opportunities were rare. Nicolas Jackson, restored to the team, fired a powerful effort over the top in the 19th minute, followed by shots from Habib Diarra and Pape Gueye that drew routine saves from El Shenawy. In the second half, Senegal continued to dominate possession but were again restricted to speculative efforts from range before Manes goal. But after they scored, it finally prompted Egypt to push forward with three strikers brought on in a late, and desperate, bid to get back into the game. Omar Marmoushs shot in stoppage time, which Edouard Mendy saved, was their only effort of substance. We totally deserved this victory, said Senegal defender Moussa Niakhate. We prevented them from playing their game. We were determined to impose our style of play. When were at this level, were very strong. Defeat ended Salahs hopes of securing a first title with his national team with the Liverpool star having little impact on the game. He had twice been a losing finalist at the Cup of Nations.

Napolis title defence hit by scoreless draw with Parma,"Jan 15, 2026, 04:55 AM","Jan 15, 2026, 04:55 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/990a9fdd78e234c7487b54691cf077ecde7bd01113fc3f6e8e764b5a88600287,"Soccer Football - Serie A - Napoli v Parma - Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Naples, Italy - January 14, 2026 Napolis Scott McTominay in action with Parmas Enrico Delprato REUTERS/Ciro De Luca",[],"NAPLES, Italy, Jan 14 - Napolis Serie A title defence was dealt another blow when they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Parma on Wednesday, a third successive stalemate for the hosts which could see them lose further ground at the top. Napoli remain third in the standings, level on 40 points with second-placed AC Milan who are away to Como on Thursday and three points off leaders Inter Milan before they host Lecce later on Wednesday. Parma are 14th on 22 points. The home side came in on the back of two 2-2 draws, coming from behind in both games with Hellas Verona and Inter Milan, and against Parma they were unable to make their dominance count in a disappointing display at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. These are the type of games where you need to score as quickly as possible, open the match up, and then it becomes a completely different match, Napoli defender Amir Rrahmani told reporters. We definitely need to be quicker, more decisive, bring more quality to our play going forward, not always two touches, sometimes just one. The first chance fell to Scott McTominay - who scored both goals against Inter - with his half-volley from a Giovanni Di Lorenzo through ball into the box deflected into the side netting. McTominay had the ball in the net minutes later but the goal was ruled out after a VAR check for an offside in the build-up and Napoli continued to probe for the opener. RINALDI IMPRESSES ON DEBUT Parma keeper Filippo Rinaldi, making his club debut, pulled off a point-blank save from Alessandro Buongiornos header after Noa Lang floated the ball into the box following a short corner. Rinaldi then parried away Rasmus Hojlunds shot on the turn, the keeper impressing in his first-ever Serie A appearance as Parma continued to frustrate the hosts and the sides went in goalless at the break. There is nothing to thank, we make the choices we think are right, Parma manager Carlos Cuesta told DAZN when asked if he had thanked his keeper after the game. We thought Filippo was ready for a great performance, so it proved. Hojlund had a great opportunity to open the scoring early in the second half when Rinaldi spilled the ball after colliding with his own defender, but the Napoli striker took too long to get a shot away, and Parma cleared the danger. Napoli made a triple substitution before the hour mark, sending on Leonardo Spinazzola, Eljif Elmas and David Neres but there was little change as the hosts were reduced to half-chances. Shots from McTominay and Stanislav Lobotka failed to trouble Rinaldi, who took a late booking for time-wasting as Parma were content to hang on and earn a point.
