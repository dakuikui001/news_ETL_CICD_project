"Global experiences, certifications, uni prep: How Nanyang Poly students can personalise their diploma with new initiative","Jan 08, 2026, 04:00 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 04:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/caa25caab6c9b1c614467087f827e2a49575cf26a70056989c5a076a18624513,"As part of the Go Beyonds International pathway, Nanyang Polytechnic sends its students on exchange to countries such as Switzerland.PHOTO: NANYANG POLYTECHNIC","['Tertiary education', 'Polytechnics', 'Branded content']","In todays fast-evolving economy, roles that did not exist five years ago are now in demand, while many current jobs are being redefined. As a result, graduates are expected to possess more than just academic knowledge: Soft skills like adaptability, real-world experience and global awareness are increasingly important prerequisites across many industries. It is against this backdrop that Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) is rethinking how it supports its students, moving away from a one-size-fits-all model towards an approach that reflects each learners strengths, interests and goals. Starting in the new academic year this April, NYP will launch its Go Beyond initiative, which features three pathways that allow students to customise their diploma journey in line with their academic and career aspirations. Importantly, these pathways are integrated into the curriculum, with no increase in hours. This means students do not need to take on additional modules or extend their studies beyond the standard three-year diploma programme. Depending on their chosen pathway, students will gain real-world experiences through internships and overseas exchange programmes, as well as earn relevant industry-recognised certifications. As most of these are assessed on a pass-or-fail basis and excluded from Grade Point Average (GPA) computation, students can fully immerse themselves in the experience without worrying about attaining a specific grade. At the heart of this new initiative is the recognition that students have different ambitions and definitions of success. NYP principal and chief executive officer Russell Chan explains: Our learners come from a diverse profile, and have their own aspirations, needs and wants. For instance, there are a fair few who seek to work prior to going on to university. Others will want to build international networks and experiences during their three years in the polytechnic. The idea is that we will have choices that align to what is important to them and they can embark on these pathways while in NYP. To cater to this wider range of needs, NYP has developed the Professional, International and University pathways, each designed to provide support and guidance, while still allowing students to keep their options open. For those who plan to progress to further studies, the University pathway offers support such as scholarships advisory, interview preparation and portfolio development. Following that, students will pursue one of three specialised options that may provide module exemptions, foundation-level preparation for university matriculation or conditional university offers. Others who are keen to gain practical experience can opt for the Professional pathway, which focuses on extended industry exposure. This includes internship opportunities that allow students to gain real-world working experience before graduation. Students will also earn industry-recognised certifications that strengthen their workplace readiness. There is also the option to undertake internships ranging from 12 weeks to a year. Those who go on 12-week internship will also complete a final year project or Teaching Enterprise Project. All experiences in the Professional pathway contribute to graduation requirements, and are included in the GPA. Those with global aspirations can embark on the International pathway, which offers overseas exchange or internship opportunities with more than 60 overseas university partners across 17 countries, including France, Finland, Switzerland, South Korea and Japan. These programmes are typically undertaken in the second or third year, when students have sufficient grounding to fully benefit from the experience. For those who opt for the overseas internship, they will undergo a 12- to 24-week overseas internship placement at an NYP partner company, gaining exposure to diverse work cultures while strengthening their global outlook and employability. With Go Beyond, students can explore experiences across all three pathways and choose one or more that support their individual ambitions. This flexibility helps them discover what suits them best.

"Proposed law changes in Spore will cut red tape in data sharing, speed up social support: Experts","Jan 07, 2026, 09:10 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 09:49 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/adb72148d9179d18ca107ff6e65fd7ae9c72870daf363c18784d38daa50ecff6,Amendments to the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA) are expected to be tabled for second reading when Parliament sits in the week of Jan 12.PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: TNP FILE,"['Data protection', 'Personal Data Protection Act', 'Singapore Parliament']","SINGAPORE –New amendments to the lawthat would allow government agencies to share data with external parties, such as social service agencies and community groups, will ensure more effective and timely delivery of services for Singaporeans. Without the proposed changes, the Government will have to seek consent from individuals before their data is shared, or establish legally that such sharing is in the public interest. That process can be slow and legally uncertain even for clearly public-spirited programmes, said experts. The proposed changes provide legal clarity for data sharing and hold external parties accountable to standards similar to those applied to public agencies, they added. Amendments to the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA) are expected to be tabled for second reading when Parliament sits in the week of Jan 12. A public consultation to discuss the recommended changes was held for three weeks between Aug 12, 2025, and Sept 2, 2025. Introduced in 2018, the PSGA allows for data sharing across the public sector, and sets out data protection and sharing requirements for government agencies. Under the law, data can be shared between public sector agencies for seven specific purposes. These include improving the efficiency or effectiveness of policy planning and service delivery, and supporting a whole-of-government approach in public sector work. Under the amendments, the Government would be able to rely on these seven prescribed purposes to share data with authorised external parties. The amendments also require that the minister who is responsible for the relevant public sector agency to authorise each case of data sharing with an external partner. The authorisation must be documented, clearly stating the specified purposes for which the data will be used, and identifying which of the PSGA purposes provides the basis for sharing. The specified partners and the parties engaged by them, as well as the specific scope of data to be shared, must also be documented. Mr Lim Chong Kin, head of technology, media and telecommunications at law firm Drew & Napier, noted that many front-line services today are delivered by external partners such as social service agencies, community groups and trade associations, which often have closer and more direct contact with residents and businesses. Without timely access to relevant data, these partners may face delays in identifying needs, verifying eligibility or providing assistance, he said. For example, community organisations providing social assistance may need timely access to a list of eligible households in a neighbourhood to distribute aid or offer follow-up support. Without this, assistance may be delayed or miss those most in need. Under current laws, government agencies have to seek consent from individuals or families before they can share data with external partners. But there are challenges to seeking consent. For example, a government agency may already know who needs help based on previous support, but it will have to seek consent for new programmes. Another challenge is that individuals may be uncontactable due to missing or outdated contact information, or they may miss notifications – which prevents them from receiving help under new programmes. Another scenario arises when multiple partners are involved in delivering coordinated services to individuals. In such a case, the individuals have to repeatedly give consent to all partners. If they miss giving consent to one party, their data is incomplete and the services they receive will be limited. Another way that agencies seek to share data with external partners is to establish legally that data sharing meets the common law ground of public interest. But experts say that can be an onerous process. As the common law develops on a case-by-case basis, there is presently a lack of legal certainty and clarity about whether specific purposes or circumstances would comprise public interest grounds, said Mr Lim. Concurring, Mr Josh Lee, managing director (Apac) of non-profit organisation Future of Privacy Forum, said that agencies often have to go through multiple layers of internal governance and legal review to determine what is public interest. As part of the review, agencies likely need to be satisfied that a proposed sharing of data is linked to a legitimate public purpose, that the data is necessary to achieve that purpose, and that the same outcome cannot be achieved through other means, said Mr Lee, adding that public officers would be more cautious as the PSGA carries criminal penalties for wrongful disclosure. In addition, if there is a new community initiative or pilot programme, it may need to be re-assessed afresh, said Mr Lee. This can cause delays or discourage potentially beneficial collaborations. While the experts acknowledge that some Singaporeans may have concerns about their personal data being shared with external parties, they also highlighted the safeguards in the proposed amendments. These include provisions ensuring that external parties who misuse shared data may be subject to the same level of penalties as public officers under the PSGA. It criminalises the acts of unauthorised disclosure of data, misuse of data and the re-identification of individuals from anonymised data. Public officers found guilty of these offences can be fined up to $5,000 and jailed for up to two years. In addition, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) obligations and penalties – which primarily applies to private sector organisations – will continue to apply for these external partners. Professor Simon Chesterman, the David Marshall Professor of Law at the National University of Singapore, said that the amendments are clearer on accountability. External partners remain subject to the PDPA, and the amended PSGA framework ensures that external parties who mishandle shared government data will face consequences. But Mr Lee said whether the safeguards are sufficient will depend on how the provisions and data governance practices are implemented over time. It may be prudent for greater support to be extended to external parties that receive public sector data on enhancing data governance practices and internal compliance controls, and navigating the twin regimes of the PSGA and the PDPA, he added. Concurring, Prof Chesterman said: If more sensitive data is to be shared to improve service delivery, there should be commensurate investment in partner capability – clear minimum standards, practical support, and proportionate compliance expectations – so partners are not given new responsibilities without the capacity to carry them out safely. Overall, experts agree that the amendments strike a balance between safeguarding personal data of Singaporeans, and enabling it to be used responsibly. These amendments tilt the scale towards suiting Singapores model of efficiency, which is necessary to enable the Government to work with social service agencies and community groups to deliver effective and timely support to Singaporeans, especially where more timely help is being expected by Singaporeans arising from the ageing population and other welfare challenges, said Mr Lim.",https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/proposed-law-changes-in-spore-to-cut-red-tape-in-data-sharing-speed-up-social-support-experts
Vape seller given increased jail term of 8 weeks after prosecution reviews sentencing position,"Jan 07, 2026, 09:00 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 09:49 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b8ded498367d05a41edb028d441d6ea6b4da973fee8a06f35aa801035e8d96b5,Orison Toh Chun Kee pleaded guilty to one count of possessing vapes for sale and one charge of offering vapes for sale on Telegram.ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG,"['Vaping/E-cigarettes', 'Singapore courts', 'State Courts', 'Singapore crime', 'Drug offences']","SINGAPORE – A vape delivery driver caught collecting more than 1,500 vape devices was sentenced to eight weeks jail on Jan 7 – eight times the jail term initially sought by the prosecution. Orison Toh Chun Kee, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of possessing vapes for sale and one charge of offering vapes for sale via the Telegram messaging app. Two other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. Toh was initially expected to plead guilty on Aug 25, 2025, but Health Sciences Authority (HSA) prosecutor Jolene Chia told the court that the authority intended torelook its sentencing submissions. The prosecution had initially sought a weeks jail and a $1,500 fine for Toh, but later increased this to 12 weeks and a $3,000 fine, citing how District Judge Wong Li Tein had, in a separate case on Aug 21, 2025,asked HSA to relook their sentencing submissions for all vape offences. Judge Wong said it was not feasible to rely on sentencing precedents from 2022 to 2024 for vaping-related cases, given public sentiment. Court records showed that Toh, who was employed as an engineer at the time of the offences, began delivering vape parcels in February 2024 and earned about $10 per trip. On Sept 2, 2025, HSA was alerted to a consignment containing vapes received by a company. HSA officers went to the location the next day and saw Toh collecting the parcel. When they searched his car, they found vapes and vape pods that were leftover deliveries from the day before. A total of 1,639 vapes were found in Tohs car. Toh later said he had planned to start selling vapes but did not manage to do so. Explaining the rationale for the increased recommended sentence, Ms Chia told the court that it was based on the increase in the number of vape offences and the governments tougher stance towards vaping offences. She also cited Prime Minister Lawrence Wongs National Day Rally speech, where he announced that thegovernment would treat vaping as a drug issue. Tohs lawyer, Mr Sameer Amir Melber, from Gabriel Law, asked for a fine, saying it was difficult to understand why the prosecution was increasing the sentence by such a high amount. He added that Toh had intended to plead guilty in April 2025, and there was no evidence to show that he was part of a syndicate or that any etomidate-laced devices were linked to his conduct. In sentencing, District Judge Terence Tay said Tohs role was critical to such illicit operations, as he was the interface between the mastermind and customers. He added that vaping is an increasing problem in Singapore that affects younger people. As the detection of such activities is extremely difficult, the judge said a stiff sentence was warranted, but it had to take into account the sentencing range prescribed by the law. For each charge of selling vapes, an offender can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/vape-seller-given-increased-jail-term-of-8-weeks-after-prosecution-reviews-sentencing-framework
"Uncertainty, cautious optimism for Venezuelans in Spore after capture of Maduro","Jan 07, 2026, 08:34 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 10:33 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5760550494859bffc448ef4e269a69c1b53b8e238dbbeb43b69e89726a1ca34a,Captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores being escorted to a courthouse in New York on Jan 5.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['Venezuela', 'Nicolas Maduro', 'Donald Trump']","SINGAPORE – On Jan 3, Martin was driving to a meeting at VivoCity at about 2pm when the 39-year-old received an unexpected call from his brother in Venezuela. Its happening. The US is bombing Venezuela, his brother said over the phone. Some 15,000km away, a twilight military operation was under way in Martins birth country that would see US military forces launch strikes andseize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduroand his wife Cilia Flores to face criminal charges in the United States. Speaking to The Straits Times on Jan 6, Martin said his immediate reaction was worry for his father and siblings, who live in the capital Caracas and other Venezuelan cities such as Guacara. A naturalised Singaporean working in the entertainment industry here, he declined to give his surname as he wanted to protect his family back home. I was very anxious, very worried, he said. Because when these things happen, you cannot do anything, being so far away. Over a 2½-hour period, US strikes hit Caracas as well as the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to the Venezuelan government. Martins brother, who lives about a 30-minute drive from La Guaira city with his wife and two daughters, told him that they could feel the impact of the explosions from their home. After that call, Martin scrambled to check in with other friends and family members in Venezuela, and was assured via voice messages that they were safe. Initial reports estimated that 55 security personnel were killed in the operation, but more recent assessments suggested that fatalities were higher and may have included civilians. It was a relief to hear that (they were well). My father is almost 80 years old, so I was happy to know that he and everybody were okay, said Martin, whose account mirrored those of other Venezuelans living in Singapore. Maduros capture has been the talk of the wider Hispanic community here, after US President Donald Trump followed the operation with rhetoric on Jan 5 thatthreatened military action against Colombia,and said that he believed the government in Cuba was likely to fall soon. Latin American Chamber of Commerce, Singapore founder Angela Torres, 47, said her friends in Venezuela have expressed a sense of cautious optimism following Maduros capture. She said that in the past, Venezuela was a very wealthy country, with a robust industry and an economy heavily concentrated in oil. What is happening in Venezuela is actually very complex because even as Maduro has been taken out, the complication is that his regime remains, said Ms Torres, who is also executive director of the chamber of commerce. There is still a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty, everything is very silent and quiet at the moment in Venezuela, she added. Everybodys like, in a wait-and-see mode. Ms Torres, who is Colombian, said people are wondering if there will be follow-up operations to detain Maduro loyalists. Mr Trump has warned Venezuelas remaining leaders that theycould be targeted if they do not cooperate with Washington. For one Venezuelan woman who has lived in Singapore for about a decade, initial happiness over the US capture of Maduro dissipated when it became clear that the post-Maduro government would still be staffed by the same establishment. Venezuelas interim President Delcy Rodriguez, who wassworn in on Jan 5, was formerly the countrys vice-president under Maduro. The Venezuelan woman in Singapore, who declined to be named out of concern for her family back home, described the situation under the previous regime as having become crueller and more repressive year after year. An estimated 7.7 million Venezuelans, or about a fifth of the population, have left their homeland since 2014 to escape Venezuelas economic and political crisis. My country is so rich in resources and opportunity, yet nowadays, people are living so poorly, she said, adding that several of her peers had sought better lives abroad. After she learnt of the US military operation, the woman, who is in her 40s, checked in with her family in Venezuela via WhatsApp and was relieved that they were safe. She said: Im watching the situation to see how it develops. For me to be optimistic (about Venezuelas future), there needs to be more changes. Ms Torres said many Colombians are optimistic that the recent events may be good for Venezuelas long-term prospects. She noted that the two countries, which share an extensive border, used to be each others main trading partner. She dismissed Mr Trumps threat of military action against Colombia, noting that Colombia and Venezuela are in very different situations. Even while (Colombian) President Gustavo Petro and President Trump have a lot of disagreements, President Petro was democratically elected, and he is in the final term. A new president will be elected on May 31, she said. Colombia has also been very close to the US administration for many years before this. Most importantly, Colombia has very strong institutions, like the courts and Congress.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/uncertainty-cautious-optimism-for-venezuelans-in-spore-after-capture-of-maduro
"Woman challenging Singapore polices decision ordered to deposit $15,000 for potential legal costs","Jan 07, 2026, 08:30 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 05:34 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/01d5907b6a4b49b1c6515923a068744fd67cfa843f8ca821a8b37f428653dbfc,"The woman was ordered on Nov 11, 2025, to deposit $15,000 with the Supreme Court registry but has since filed an appeal against the order.ST PHOTO: GIN TAY","['Singapore courts', 'Police', 'Civil lawsuits', 'Court trials']","SINGAPORE – A woman said to have a litigious tendency was ordered by the High Court to provide $15,000 as security to cover the potential costs of a court challenge she filed against a decision by the Singapore police to close her case. The sum is to be deposited with the court, acting as collateral to cover potential legal costs incurred by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in the event that she fails in her application for judicial review. Madam Yang Hong had argued that she was willing to pay $1 to move the case forward. The Chinese national was ordered on Nov 11, 2025, to deposit $15,000 with the Supreme Court registry but has since filed an appeal against the order. In written grounds of decision issued on Jan 7, Assistant Registrar Randeep Singh Koonar said it was just to order security for costs given that the SPF would likely face significant difficulties in enforcing costs orders against Madam Yang in China. The assistant registrar added that her challenge did not have a reasonable prospect of success and that ordering security for costs would not unfairly stifle her claim. He said $15,000 was a reasonable sum, considering the costs guidelines of $14,000 to $35,000 for judicial review proceedings and the amount of work and time likely to be involved in defending the case. It would also be obvious that Madam Yang had a litigious streak, and a propensity to advance wide-ranging arguments, with little regard to their merit, he said, noting that she has inundated the court with a mass of documents without explaining their relevance. It was Madam Yangs prerogative to formulate her claim. However, she could not expect to be excused from the costs consequences which came with running a wide-ranging and extravagant case. The woman, who described herself as a public health whistle-blower, had lodged a police report in 2024 in Singapore over an alleged fraudulent business deal and an alleged public health risk. In her court filings, she purported to represent a Chinese company, Guangzhou Crown Trading, which was placed in bankruptcy in December 2023. Madam Yangs claim related to a contract made on March 5, 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic was becoming a global medical emergency. Under the contract, Singapore-registered company Innoso agreed to sell to Guangzhou Crown a fabric material that is used to manufacture medical masks. According to the contract, the material was to have a bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) of more than 99.995 per cent. Madam Yang claimed that the delivered material – shipped by Indian company Jindal Poly Films – did not meet the specifications because it had a lower BFE, making it unfit for mask production. She said the alleged fraud caused Guangzhou Crown to suffer huge losses. She also claimed that Innoso had imported 149 tonnes of the material into Singapore and that this posed an imminent public health risk. Madam Yang said she lodged criminal complaints in China in 2020, and in India in 2022, but no action has yet been taken by the authorities in those countries. A criminal revision she filed in the Indian courts is pending. On Oct 8, 2024, she filed a police report in Singapore. The SPF initially told Madam Yang that based on the known facts, it would not take further action, but the decision could be revised if new evidence came to light. This led to a lengthy exchange of e-mails between her and the SPF. After the SPF said on Feb 20, 2025, that it would investigate her report, she made demands as to how the investigations should proceed. On July 29, the SPF told Madam Yang that, having considered the facts and circumstances of the case, and having consulted the Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC), it had decided to take no further action against Innoso for any criminal offences. The SPF said investigations into the matter would cease and the case would be closed. On Aug 6, Madam Yang filed the current application, seeking permission to start judicial review proceedings. On Oct 7, the SPF, represented by the AGC, asked the court to order her to furnish at least $15,000 as security for its legal costs because she lives outside Singapore. Madam Yang, who represented herself, argued that the usual legal principles for ordering security for costs did not apply in this case due to the inequality of resources between the individual and the state, and the public interest underlying judicial review proceedings. The assistant registrar rejected her argument, citing a Privy Council decision that there was no fundamental distinction between public authorities and private litigants in deciding whether to order security for costs.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-challenging-spore-polices-decision-ordered-to-deposit-15000-for-potential-legal-costs
First self-driving shuttle vehicles in Punggol to start serving public within 3 months,"Jan 07, 2026, 08:25 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 11:23 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5357784beb72b8da413d4a0b6d07449b684a18d662f8720ae1fb7c419563ceb3,The 10km-long route will connect residents of Matilda Court and Punggol Clover with the polyclinic at Oasis Terraces via Punggol Plaza.PHOTO: ST FILE,"['Self-driving vehicles', 'Punggol', 'LTA', 'Jeffrey Siow', 'Sun Xueling']","SINGAPORE – The first self-driving shuttle route in Punggol will open to the public in two to three months, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling on Jan 7. The 10km route will connect residents of Matilda Court and Punggol Clover with the polyclinic at Oasis Terraces via Punggol Plaza. A round trip will take 35 minutes to complete. Ride-hailing firm Grab will operate the service in partnership with WeRide, a Guangzhou-based autonomous vehicle company. It is the first ofthree driverless shuttle routesthat will be rolled out in Punggol. These routes cover parts of Punggol that are harder to reach by current public transport options, and could shave up to 15 minutes of travel time for residents. The authorities previously said that the first route was set to open to the public by the second quarter of 2026. Five- and eight-seater vehicles in bright purple livery with an amber beacon on the roof will be used to ply the three routes. In a Facebook post on Jan 7, Ms Sun said she hosted union leaders on trial rides of the autonomous shuttle in Punggol. They included representatives from the National Trades Union Congress, National Transport Workers Union, National Private Hire Vehicles Association and Taxi Kaki Singapore, an advocacy group for taxi drivers and platform workers. The shuttles on the first route have completed mapping and familiarisation, and have clocked more than 10,000km safely without incident, Ms Suns post said. Starting this month, we will be inviting other stakeholders to try out the rides. These include key grassroots leaders and agency partners, she said. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Jan 7 that these community rides will help it gather feedback to improve the commuting experience. This phase is a step before commercial operations begin. Apps will also be rolled out by shuttle operators to allow commuters to check ride availability, said Ms Sun. For the first route, no pre-booking will be needed. The Straits Times previously reported that the service will run from 9.30am to 5pm on weekdays, with passengers able to view shuttle schedules and track vehicles in real time on the Grab app. As a precaution, a safety operator will be on board each vehicle at all times to take over control if needed. Passengers will also be covered by insurance in case of an accident. Ms Sun, who is also an MP for Punggol GRC, said the autonomous shuttles will complement Singapores transport system by improving first- and last-mile connectivity. She had earlier said Punggol was chosen as the pilot area due to its compact layout and diverse population. Ms Sun said the Transport Ministry will work with union leaders onjob opportunities and concerns drivers may have about their jobs. Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow previously said that autonomous vehicles could ease public transports manpower challenge. Singapore faces a bus driver shortage due to an ageing workforce and fewer young Singaporeans joining the industry. The first autonomous vehicle test in Punggol was conducted in mid-October 2025. LTA had previously granted approval to Grab and WeRide to test 11 shuttles on two routes. Grab will operate two of the three planned routes in Punggol. The second Grab-run route, which is 12km long, will connect Punggol West and Punggol North, with stops at Punggol Coast Mall, which has a bus interchange, and One Punggol, where the Sam Kee LRT station is located. The third will be operated by transport operator ComfortDelGro, using vehicles supplied by Chinese autonomous driving firm Pony.ai. This route, also 12km long, connects Punggol East and Punggol North, with stops at the bus interchange and LRT station. Both Grab and ComfortDelGro said previously that they aim to have a shuttle arrive every 15 minutes. In September 2025, Mr Siow said Singaporeplans to deploy between 100 and 150 self-driving vehicles by the end of 2026,as part of a broader push to roll out autonomous transport across the island over the next five years.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/first-self-driving-shuttle-vehicles-in-punggol-to-open-to-public-within-3-months

Law Jia Yi was sentenced to 15 months and 25 weeks jail on Jan 6 after pleading guilty to seven charges for various offences, including driving without a valid licence, driving without due care and attention, methamphetamine consumption, and possession of Kpods for sale. She was also disqualified from driving and holding a licence for 30 months. Law was driving along Siloso Road at about 8pm on Oct 22, 2024, when she was distracted by her phone. She lost control of the car, and it skidded and crashed into a railing on the road in the opposite lane. The 23-year-old, who did not have a driving licence, rented the car from a person named Jun Xiong on Carousell on Oct 19, 2024. When police officers searched the vehicle after the accident, they found a foldable knife and 98 vape pods inside. Tests conducted by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) showed that 91 of the 98 pods contained etomidate. Law admitted that she purchased 100 pods on Oct 19, 2024, from an unknown person on Telegram for $750 and said they were for her personal consumption. The court heard that she was previously arrested on Aug 9, 2024, for a similar offence. At about 5.15pm that day, police officers attended to a fight inside a car at the open carpark near Yishun Avenue 5. Upon arriving at the scene and engaging the accused, officers found the accused in possession of 55 vape pods, one vaporiser with pod and three vaporisers without pods in her vehicle, said HSA prosecutor Donn Praabu Dennis. Laboratory analysis results revealed that 49 of the 55 pods contained etomidate. Law admitted to purchasing the pods in early August 2024 via Telegram, saying the pods cost between $65 and $70 each. She said she kept the pods in the car as her father prohibited them at home. She also maintained that the pods were for personal consumption, adding that she would sell them to friends only upon request for $10 more than the cost price. On the same day, Law provided two urine samples, which were found to contain methamphetamine. In January 2025, she was again caught for driving without a licence and for drug consumption. Court documents stated that Law took the keys to her boyfriends company car without his knowledge and drove it to the Marina Bay Sands carpark. At about 8.35pm, Law got into a dispute with her boyfriend inside their hotel room. Undisclosed items were broken during the kerfuffle, prompting hotel staff to call the police. She then tried to leave with the car but was stopped by the hotels security officers. Police officers who arrived at the scene later found drugs on Law, and her urine subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine. Regarding Laws vape-related charges, the HSA prosecutor told the court that she has shown a pattern of escalating reoffending, citing the increase in the number of Kpods she was found with. He said Law became dependent on vapes after quitting cigarettes. He also noted her bulk-buying strategy and commercial awareness, as demonstrated by how she occasionally sold Kpods to her friends for above the cost price. When asked if she had anything to say in mitigation, Law shook her head. Since Sept 1, the Government has introduced aslew of tougher measuresagainst etomidate-related offences. For the possession of Kpods for sale, an offender can be jailed for up to two years, fined up to $10,000, or both. For methamphetamine consumption, an offender can be jailed for between one and 10 years, fined up to $20,000, or both. Offenders caught driving without due care and attention can be fined up to $5,000, jailed for up to two years, or both. Those caught driving without a valid licence can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to three years, or both.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-woman-who-drove-without-licence-had-more-than-90-kpods-in-car
"CES 2026: Paper batteries, blackjack-playing robot among products showcased by Singapore firms","Jan 07, 2026, 07:45 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 11:46 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/723afda9f26ea246108b73dba2e29a887047ef1aef6d0642617c9ba69d57b090,Flint is set to commercialise its first line of paper batteries later in 2026.ST PHOTO: SARAH KOH,"['Consumer electronics', 'Sustainability', 'Robots', 'AI/artificial intelligence']","LAS VEGAS – Common rechargeable batteries such as lithium-ion ones rely on scarce materials that can also be dangerous, but one Singapore start-up is bringing a more sustainable and safer alternative to electronic devices. Flint is set to commercialise its first line of paper batteries later in 2026, which can be used in keyboards, computer mice and wearables. Chief among its materials is cellulose, which can be extracted from all kinds of plants. The 10-strong team is one of more than 30 firms from Singapore among over 4,000 exhibitors showcasing their most cutting-edge products from Jan 6 to 9 at CES 2026. The Straits Times trawled the show floor of the worlds largest tech trade show, which is held annually in Las Vegas, to highlight innovations from Singapore. While these cylindrical rechargeable batteries resemble conventional alkaline AAA batteries, they are less prone to overheating due to their make-up of water-based ingredients such as carbon ink and binder gel. The carbon footprint from manufacturing each battery is also about 30 per cent smaller than that of a traditional battery. The capacity of Flints batteries is also on a par with popular AAA batteries sold by major competitors such as Panasonic, at around 1,250 milliamp-hours. The start-up is currently focused on selling its products to businesses, with several, such as consumer electronics firm Logitech, testing the feasibility of Flints batteries within its products. Itll take another three more months before the batteries officially go into the market, said Mr Carlo Charles, who co-founded Flint in 2020. Pouch cells – batteries as thin as a sheet of paper – are also among Flints newest offerings, which are meant to be an alternative to lithium-ion batteries used in devices such as wearables and trackers, which depend on scarce raw materials such as lithium and cobalt. In June, Flint will be launching its own luggage tag and passport cover that double as trackers powered by these pouch cells. Robots were aplenty on the CES show floor, but Sharpa boasts an autonomous full-body robot North, which has hands as dexterous as a humans. These hands, called Wave, are equipped with thousands of tactile sensors in each fingertip, allowing them to detect variables such as texture and force even from something as light as a feather. Its able to detect very subtle changes in force, at differences of 0.005 newton, from zero to three newtons, said Sharpa go-to-market global vice-president Alicia Veneziani, adding that this allows North to carry out tasks and handle objects precisely. Each hand is also equipped with 22 degrees of freedom, relatively close to the 27 independent joint motions that human hands have. This allows the robot to move its fingers laterally, and rotate and stretch its digits, besides bending at the joints. In a demonstration of its skills on the show floor, the robot took Polaroids of visitors, engaged in countless games of ping-pong, and dealt cards at a blackjack table, further impressing players with its reasoning capabilities. When assembling a paper windmill, the robot was able to delicately handle paper without creasing it, but also exert the necessary force to set in place a plastic lock. For humans to lift a box, we would first use our vision to locate where it is, and position our hands based on factors such as size, said Ms Veneziani. But after we make contact with the box, what you see becomes less relevant – what our hands feel become much more important. We make sense of things like weight and texture to then decide how best to hold the box. This whole feedback loop is what we have recreated through our hardware and software. The team expects industries such as hospitality to benefit from the newly launched full-body robot, which can take over more mundane tasks such as cutting and cooking large volumes of food. After showcasing its ultra-thin metalens – a flat lens that focuses light – at CES 2025, MetaOptics Technologies returned this year to showcase a mini smartphone that will be launched later in 2026. Founder Mark Thng envisions the device, which is set to be priced between $500 and $1,000, as a lower-cost alternative for a niche market of customers who do not need a larger, expensive smartphone with extensive features, such as young users and the elderly. The phone will be around 6mm thick, and have no additional bump where its camera lenses are located. Measuring at around 9cm diagonally, the phone has 5G capabilities and allows users to surf the internet, call and send texts. However, its compact size would discourage activities such as playing games and scrolling on social media, said Mr Thng. This could make the phone particularly useful for parents who want a distraction-free phone for their child. The main objective of this launch is to show customers the possibilities of miniaturisation with metalenses on the phone, said deputy chief executive Aloysius Chua, who added that the firm will also be open to working with tech giants to integrate this technology into mainstream smartphones. The team is also assessing the feasibility of working in technology from its own mini, portable projector, which would allow the phone to function as a projector without external cables. When attached to a dive mask, this head-up display by Daive will be able to beam essential information such as oxygen levels and water depth onto the inside of the mask. With a selection of pre-set messages that can be personalised via an app, divers can rotate a knob at the side of the display to be sent to fellow divers at a maximum distance of 10m away. These messages can include instructions to stay close or ascend together, said founder Cloris Huang. Having gone on diving trips for two years now, she was inspired to create this display due to how unpredictable the underwater environment can be. The display has a battery life of about 20 hours. The product has to undergo further waterproofing tests and a crowdfunding round in March before mass production, said Ms Huang. Of the 30-odd firms from Singapore at CES 2026, six are participating with the support of Enterprise Singapore and have booths in the Singapore Pavilion. On Jan 6, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Finance and Manpower Shawn Huang toured the booths together with representatives from the Singapore Business Federation. Mr Huang said it is important for firms from Singapore to showcase their capabilities to ensure the Republic has a substantive role to play in driving global innovation. Having companies and attendees come to see us also allows us to benchmark ourselves against global competition, and see where we stand, said Mr Huang. Hopefully, we can inspire more Singapore companies to come onboard and be part of this platform. Enterprise Singapore has supported around 70 firms in showcasing their products at CES since 2018. The support includes working with trade associations like the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises to defray the costs of exhibiting, and to connect participating firms with key stakeholders and partners in the North American market.",https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/ces-2026-paper-batteries-blackjack-playing-robot-among-products-showcased-by-spore-firms

In a Facebook post that evening, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the fire at 14 Sungei Kadut Avenue at about 6.40pm. A production area on the second floor of the four-storey industrial building was on fire when SCDF officers arrived. Firefighters deployed three water jets to contain the fire within the workshop, said SCDF. The fire was extinguished at about 8pm, it added. One person was assessed for smoke inhalation and taken to Singapore General Hospital. SCDF added that 30 people were evacuated from the affected building before its officers arrived. When The Straits Times arrived at the scene at about 8.20pm, part of the building was seen cordoned off as SCDF officers attended to the site, which is also the address of glass manufacturer Da Di Glass. The walls surrounding a room on the second floor appeared charred, with the damage stretching up towards the top floor. The Straits Times understands that the building contains a glass factory on the first level, a facility for aluminium making on the second level, where the fire broke out, and dormitory facilities on the third and fourth levels. The cause of the fire is under investigation. ST has contacted Da Di Glass for more information. In a video posted on the Friends of Yew Tee Facebook group, plumes of smoke can be seen billowing from Sungei Kadut. This is the second fire to have broken out in the Sungei Kadut area in a week.

Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY./File Photo","['Pakistan', 'Media', 'Saudi Arabia']","ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 - Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year. The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is facing acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about U.S. commitments in the Middle East. The mutual defence deal was signed following Israels strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region. One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion. The first source said the total deal was worth $4 billion, with an additional $2 billion to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion. The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the deal. Pakistans Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks including on military cooperation between the two sides, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday. TESTED IN COMBAT Amir Masood, a retired Air Marshall and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment including JF-17s and electronic systems and weapons systems for the jets. He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations. The JF-17s marketability has been increased because it is tested and has been used in combat, he told Reuters, adding that its also cost effective. Pakistan has said the aircraft was deployed during its conflict with India in May last year, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades. Pakistans military and finance and defence ministries and military did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabias government media office also did not respond. The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership. Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress. In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6 billion support package for Pakistan, including a $3 billion deposit at the central bank and $3 billion worth of oil supplies on deferred payment. Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2 billion deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures. ARMS SALES OUTREACH Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry. Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion with Libyas eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the countrys largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft. Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East. On Tuesday, Pakistans defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the countrys economic outlook. Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months, Khawaja Asif told broadcaster Geo News. Pakistan is currently under a $7 billion IMF programme, its 24th, which followed a short-term $3 billion deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Funds support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.

Former Cambodian national Chen Zhi, a 38-year-old businessman with interests spanning real estate, consumer services and financial services through his Phnom Penh-based Prince Group, was caught on Jan 6. A press release by the Cambodian government said the operation followed months of joint investigations between the authorities in Cambodia and China. Meanwhile, Cambodias Ministry of Interior confirmed that it revoked Chens citizenship in December 2025. The statement said that Chen was arrested along with Xu Ji Liang and Shao Ji Hui. All three have since been deported to China on Beijings request. Chens troubles started on Oct 14, 2025, after the US and Britain announcedsweeping sanctions on him, his Prince Group, and his close associates. The US and British authorities accused the group of committing money laundering and wire fraud offences, and operating forced-labour scam compounds in Cambodia. As part of the sanctions, the US Treasury designated Prince Group – a massive Cambodia-based corporation with interests spanning real estate, financial and consumer services – as a transnational criminal empire. Several assets owned by the group were seized globally, including nearly 130,000 bitcoins worth around US$15 billion (S$19.2 billion), and some 19 properties in London, including one worth nearly £100 million (S$173 million). Altogether, 146 people and entities were sanctioned by the US Treasury. About two weeks after the announcement, the Singapore Police Forceconducted raids on Oct 30, 2025, and seized assets worth more than $150 million, including six properties, a yacht and 11 luxury vehicles. On Nov 4, Taipei detained 25 people and seized NT$4.5 billion (S$183 million) in assets linked to Prince Group, including 26 high-end cars, properties and bank accounts. The same day, Hong Kong froze assets worth HK$2.75 billion (S$452 million) linked to the syndicate. The US authorities have accused Chen of using a complicated network of over 100 shell and holding companies, located around the world, to launder criminal proceeds. Chen and the group are accused of profiting from several transnational crimes including through blackmail involving sexually explicit materials – often from minors – money laundering, wire fraud, corruption, illegal online gambling and industrial-scale human trafficking, torture and extortion of enslaved workers in at least 10 scam compounds in Cambodia. But the embattled businessman has denied any wrongdoing so far. Around a month after the sanctions were announced, Prince Group issued a statement on Nov 11, 2025, toreject any accusations levied against the company and Chen. The Cambodian group said the allegations were baseless and appeared to be designed to justify the seizure of its assets worth billions of dollars. The group said it engaged lawyers from American law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, and claimed that both Chen and the group will be fully exonerated once the full facts have been established.

Among the messages were those in which Mr Sugimoto sought sexual relationships with multiple female staff and commented on their physical appearance. He also touched female staff members bodies several times, according to the report, which was based on a survey of around 6,000 employees. The feeling of victimisation was extremely severe, the report said, describing his responsibility as grave. It said his actions could have violated the anti-stalking law or constituted the crime of non-consensual indecency. Mr Kenji Kawai, one of three lawyers appointed by the Fukui prefectural government to investigate the case, told a press conference that Mr Sugimoto had carried out acts of harassment for around 20 years, even before he was first elected Fukui governor in 2019. After joining one of the predecessors of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Mr Sugimoto intermittently took posts in Fukui, serving as head of the general affairs department at the Fukui prefectural government in 2004 and a vice-governor in 2013. Mr Sugimoto, 63, sent sexual texts such as I want to kiss you and I have an irresistible urge to hug you to at least four female staff. He warned them not to reveal the texts to other people, telling them: Keep it completely secret and take it to your grave. Mr Sugimoto sent the texts using the Line app and his private e-mail address, the report said. The investigation also confirmed acts of harassment during social events. Mr Sugimoto put his hand inside a female staff members skirt and touched her buttocks, and also sat side by side on a two-seat sofa with a female staff member and touched her thigh, the report said. Mr Sugimoto admitted that he had sent such texts in hearings, explaining that he had affection for the message recipients and that he was drunk and became careless, the team said. But while apologising to the victims, he denied the claims of groping, saying he has absolutely no recollection of such incidents, the report said. Following the disclosure of the report, Mr Sugimoto said in a statement: I respect the findings and their evaluation, adding he offers deep apologies to the victims. He said he will respond to the matter in writing but has no plans to hold a press conference, citing the need to protect the victims. Mr Sugimoto, who had been serving his second term, resigned in December but did not reveal the content of the messages at the time, saying that an investigation was under way. The issue came to light after one female victim notified an outside consultation office in April 2025. The lawyers launched their investigation in September, carrying out the survey on all the around 6,000 employees at the prefectural office. The lawyers came into direct contact with 14 of the respondents and obtained cooperation, including submission of materials backing up their claims, from four people including the whistleblower.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov","['Africa', 'China', 'Trade']","BEIJING, Jan 7 - Chinas top diplomat began his annual New Year tour of Africa on Wednesday, focusing on strategic trade access across eastern and southern Africa as Beijing seeks to secure key shipping routes and resource supply lines. Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to Ethiopia, Africas fastest‑growing large economy; Somalia, a Horn of Africa state offering access to key global shipping lanes; Tanzania, a logistics hub linking minerals‑rich central Africa to the Indian Ocean; and Lesotho, a small southern African economy squeezed by U.S. trade measures. His trip this year runs until January 12. Beijing aims to highlight countries it views as model partners of President Xi Jinpings flagship Belt and Road infrastructure programme and to expand export markets, particularly in young, increasingly affluent economies such as Ethiopia, where the IMF forecasts growth of 7.2% this year. China, the worlds largest bilateral lender, faces growing competition from the European Union to finance African infrastructure, as countries hit by pandemic‑era debt strains now seek investment over loans. The real litmus test for 2026 isnt just the arrival of Chinese investment, but the Africanisation of that investment. As Wang Yi visits hubs like Ethiopia and Tanzania, the conversation must move beyond just building roads to building factories, said Judith Mwai, policy analyst at Development Reimagined, an Africa-focussed consultancy. For African leaders, this tour is an opportunity to demand that Chinas small yet beautiful projects specifically target our industrial gaps, turning African raw materials into finished products on African soil, rather than just facilitating their exit, she added. On his start-of-year trip in 2025, Wang visited Namibia, the Republic of Congo, Chad and Nigeria. FIRST DIPLOMATIC MISSION TO SOMALIA IN DECADES His visit to Somalia will be the first by a Chinese foreign minister since the 1980s and is expected to provide Mogadishu with a diplomatic boost after Israel became the first country to formally recognise the breakaway Republic of Somaliland, a northern region that declared itself independent in 1991. Beijing, which reiterated its support for Somalia after the Israeli announcement in December, is keen to reinforce its influence around the Gulf of Aden, the entrance to the Red Sea and a vital corridor for Chinese trade transiting the Suez Canal to Europe. Further south, Tanzania is central to Beijings plan to secure access to Africas vast copper deposits. Chinese firms are refurbishing the Tazara Railway that runs through the country into Zambia. Li Qiang made a landmark trip to Zambia in November, the first visit by a Chinese premier in 28 years. The railway is widely seen as a counterweight to the U.S. and European Union-backed Lobito Corridor, which connects Zambia to Atlantic ports via Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. CHINA CHAMPIONS FREE TRADE IN LESOTHO By visiting the southern African kingdom of Lesotho, Wang aims to highlight Beijings push to position itself as a champion of free trade. Last year, China offered tariff-free market access to its $19 trillion economy for the worlds poorest nations, fulfilling a pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2024 China-Africa Cooperation summit in Beijing. Lesotho, one of the worlds poorest nations with a gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, was among the countries hardest hit by U.S. President Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs last year, facing duties of up to 50% on its exports to the United States.

The arrests took place on Dec 31 across five northern municipalities, including the capital Hanoi, according to police in Hung Yen province. The suspects were using advanced technology for fraud and online gambling, police said in a statement on Jan 6. The gang had used social media to advertise goods for sale, but failed to deliver them and deleted their profiles once victims had transferred funds. The stolen money was then transferred to online gambling accounts to avoid detection by the authorities. Police confiscated five cars and 42 mobile phones during the operation, and froze 125 accounts at 16 banks. In mid-December, police from northern Lang Son province arrested 22 Vietnamese suspects in Cambodia on similar fraud charges in a joint operation between the two countries. There were 3,000 victims in that case, scammed out of US$285 million. Since 2020, Vietnamese victims have lost US$1.5 billion in more than 24,000 online fraud cases, police said in late 2025. Across South-east Asia, criminal gangs have used casinos, hotels and fortified compounds as bases to carry out sophisticated cyberscams, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Cambodia hosts dozens of scam centres with tens of thousands of people perpetrating online scams – some willingly and others trafficked – in a multibillion-dollar illicit industry.

Dichlorosilane is a precursor chemical mainly used in thin-film deposition processes in chip manufacturing and is of significant importance to integrated circuit manufacturing. The investigation comes a day after China announceda ban on exports of dual-use items to Japanamid strained bilateral ties. China said the probe was initiated at the request of its domestic dichlorosilane producers, which claimed volumes imported from Japan showed an overall upward trend from 2022 to 2024 while prices fell by a cumulative 31 per cent, causing damage to the production and operation of the local industry. The probe covers alleged dumping between July 1, 2024 and June 30, 2025 and assessing potential injury to domestic producers from Jan 1, 2022 to June 30, 2025, according to the statement. In a separate document published by the ministry, a firm representing the industry provided a list of producers, exporters and importers of the compound including three Japanese companies, namely Shin-Etsu Chemical, Air Liquide Japan G.K. and Mitsubishi Chemical Group Corporation. The investigation will generally conclude before Jan 7, 2027, with a possible extension of six months, the ministry said, adding that the authorities will conduct the investigation in accordance with the law and make an objective and fair ruling. Ties between the Asian neighbours have deteriorated since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in early November that a Chinese attack on the democratically governed island of Taiwan could be deemedan existential threat to Japan, a remark that Beijing said was provocative.

The raid follows waves oflarge-scale detentions of unregistered Christiansin recent months, as Beijing steps up scrutiny of churches that operate outside the control of the ruling Communist Party. Beijing has long required religious groups to be registered. Under President Xi Jinping, the government has tightened control over all religions and in recent years increased crackdowns and regulations targeting unregistered organisations, making it even harder for them to raise funds, preach online and hold in-person meetings. The detentions of the members of the Early Rain Covenant Church, a large, unofficial house church based in the south-western city of Chengdu, took place on Jan 6, according to the church statement and a separate statement on the detentions from advocacy group Human Rights Watch. Those detained included current church leader Li Yingqiang, whose home was raided by police, according to the church and non-governmental organisation (NGO) statements. Reuters could not determine on what grounds the Early Rain Covenant Church members were detained, or whether they had been charged. Efforts to contact the church through social media were unsuccessful. The Chengdu public security bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government should immediately free those detained and let them freely practice their religion, said Dr Yalkun Uluyol, Human Rights Watch China researcher. China has more than 44 million Christians registered with state-approved churches, the majority Protestant, data shows. But tens of millions more are estimated to be part of illegal house churches whose congregations meet in secret. More than 100 Christians belonging to such churches were detained in a sweeping police raid near the eastern city of Wenzhou in December, according to Human Rights in China, a New York-based NGO. Nearly 30 pastors and staff of Zion Church, another major underground church, were detained by police in a nationwide operation in October, the biggest such crackdown since 2018. Established in 2008, the Early Rain Covenant Church was raided by police in 2018, when founder Wang Yi and more than 100 pastors were detained. Wang was later sentenced to nine years in prison on subversion charges. NGOs estimate Early Rain has more than 500 members, making it one of Chinas larger house churches.

In a speech to farmers in Karawang, east of the capital Jakarta, Mr Prabowo celebrated an important victory in achieving rice self-sufficiency within just over a year since he entered office in October 2024. No nation is truly free if food is not available to its people. A nation cannot be independent if its food supply depends on other countries, he said. Indonesia last achieved rice self-sufficiency in 2008, and before that in the mid-1980s. Rice is a staple food in the South-east Asian nation of 286 million people. According to the National Food Agency, a government body aimed at advancing food security, Indonesia produced 34.71 million tonnes of rice in 2025, exceeding annual consumption needs of 31.19 million tonnes. Today is a happy day for me, said Mr Prabowo, who at the start of his administration set a four-year target for rice self-sufficiency. It was achieved years ahead of schedule, with the government citing increased subsidies for farmers and streamlined regulations. If many critics sneer and say we cant achieve food self-sufficiency, today we prove that we are food self-sufficient, Mr Prabowo said. According to Statistics Indonesia, South-east Asias largest economy used to import rice from major exporters Vietnam, Thailand and India. But according to the government, Indonesia did not import any rice at all in 2025. On the campaign trail, Mr Prabowo put food security and agricultural self-sufficiency at the forefront. After assuming the presidency, helaunched a free meal initiativeaimed at tackling child malnutrition, which he said provided nutritious food to 55 million people. But critics have argued that Mr Prabowos flagship programme took away financial resources from other important initiatives, and pointed tomore than 10,000 cases of food poisoninglinked to the free meal scheme.

US Health Secretary Kennedy flips food pyramid to emphasise red meat and whole milk,"Jan 08, 2026, 06:15 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 06:15 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ddb2c89ab5a0e669c4ec1a9e0d22df3fc039b3c3b43d84ef167ae4d0ee55ec0d,"US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., released new guidelines that urge Americans to prioritise protein and avoid the sugary, processed foods.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG","['United States', 'Health and well-being', 'US Food and Drug Administration']","WASHINGTON - In a striking reversal of past nutrition guidance, the Trump administration released new dietary guidelines on Jan 7 that flip the food pyramid on its head, putting steak, cheese and whole milk near the top. The new guidelines urge Americans to prioritise protein and avoid the sugary, processed foods that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said are poisonous to health. My message is clear: Eat real food, Mr Kennedy said at a briefing rolling out the guidelines, where he positioned them as the key to preventing chronic disease and improving Americans health. After years of being advised to avoid eating too much red meat and foods high in fats, Americans are now being told to embrace them. The document, which is far shorter than previous versions, codifies some of Mr Kennedys frequent talking points, like recommending that people cook with butter and beef tallow despite the fact that scientific evidence does not support doing so. On other points, the guidelines do not stray far from mainstream nutrition advice. They encourage Americans to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and stop short of explicitly saying that people should eat more saturated fats, though Mr Kennedy had pledged to end the war on them. And they make no direct mention of seed oils, a frequent target for Mr Kennedy, who has repeatedly claimed – without evidence – that they harm health. The guidelines have been endorsed by the American Medical Association, a group that just days ago sharply condemned Mr Kennedys upheaval of the childhood vaccine schedule. At the briefing, Mr Kennedy also thanked the American Academy of Paediatrics for partnering with the administration, an organisation that is suing Mr Kennedy over his changes to vaccine policy. The American Heart Association issued a lukewarm statement of support for the new guidelines, voicing concern that they could lead people to consume too much saturated fat and sodium. While the guidelines say people can season their meats and vegetables with salt, they also recommend avoiding salty, processed foods and do not change the limits on sodium. As the Health and Agriculture departments official guidance on what to eat and drink for good health, the guidelines shape the foods served in schools, hospitals, prisons, military bases and through federal assistance programmes. They are updated every five years and rarely change in substance. But Mr Kennedy was dismissive of the recommendations of an expert committee tapped to oversee the guidelines during the Biden administration, instead turning to a new set of handpicked experts who worked in secret over the last few months. Mr Kennedy had criticised previous guidelines as being influenced by food industries, but five of the 10 current scientific experts disclosed recent financial relationships with beef, dairy or pork industries, or food, infant formula, supplement or pharmaceutical companies. The guidelines focus on priorities from Mr Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again movement, emphasising protein, which most Americans already get enough of. They advise adults to consume 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day – 50 per cent to 100 per cent more than what federal health officials have previously recommended for peoples basic needs (0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day). There isnt solid evidence that everyone needs to consume this much protein. But many experts already recommend similar amounts for people who are trying to lose weight or are strength training to build muscle. The new guidelines say that people can get protein from animal sources like red meat, poultry, seafood, eggs and dairy, and plant sources like legumes, nuts and seeds, and soy. While research suggests that getting more of your protein from plant rather than animal sources can reduce risks of cardiovascular disease and earlier death, the new guidelines dont steer people toward plant proteins. They also take a hard line on added sugars, telling people to avoid sugar-sweetened beverages and to limit other sources of the sugars. They also recommend that children do not start eating added sugars until they are 10 – much later than previous guidelines, which recommended avoiding added sugars until age 2. The new guidelines recommend significantly cutting back on highly processed refined carbohydrates, which they define as white bread, flour tortillas and crackers. Mr Kennedy has long condemned ultraprocessed foods – typically defined as those with ingredients not commonly used in home kitchens – which have been linked to a range of health conditions including obesity, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. While the new guidelines do not directly use the term ultraprocessed foods, they do recommend avoiding a more vague category of highly processed items such as chips, cookies and candy that have added sugars or sodium, and those that contain certain additives including artificial flavours, preservatives, petroleum-based dyes and low-calorie sweeteners. For months, Mr Kennedy and Dr Marty Makary, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, had said that the new guidelines would end the so-called war on saturated fats, prompting consumer health groups and nutrition experts to worry that the new guidelines would recommend that people consume more saturated fats. That move would put peoples health at risk, experts said, since saturated fats have been shown to raise cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease. The administration kept the saturated fat recommendation unchanged, suggesting that no more than 10 per cent of daily calories should come from the fats. But the guidelines also include the contradictory advice to prioritise foods that are high in saturated fats, such as red meat, full-fat dairy products and butter and beef tallow. Consuming one 8-ounce rib-eye steak, for example, would put many people over their daily saturated fat limit. On alcohol, the guidelines are vague, recommending that people consume less, but offering no concrete guidance on what that means. Previous guidelines had recommended that men have no more than two drinks per day and women no more than one.

As a result of the attack, Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions are almost completely without electricity, the ministry said in a statement on Telegram. Critical infrastructure is operating on reserve power. Russian attacks have long targeted Ukraines energy network and have intensified in recent months. Ukraines Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said impending snowfalls and temperatures plunging overnight to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) were likely to compound disruptions to power and heating. Ukraines energy system is under enemy attacks every day, and energy workers are operating in extremely difficult conditions to provide people with light and heat, Svyrydenko wrote on Telegram. Deteriorating weather conditions put additional strain on critical infrastructure, she said. Public broadcaster Suspilne said power cuts had hit the city of Dnipro, where the metro had stopped running, and other parts of the region. The head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional council told the broadcaster it was uncertain when power would be restored. Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration in Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiys home town in the region, warned residents to brace for lengthy power cuts and said generators should be brought into use as much as possible. Ukrainian Railways said trains in the two regions and signalling systems were being switched to reserve systems and stations were being operated with generators. Zaporizhzhia Regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said the power cuts meant that air raid sirens were not audible. He said mobile telephone networks were working in emergency conditions and asked residents to stay off the networks. Fedorov said hospitals in the city of Zaporizhzhia were functioning normally and water supplies would be quickly restored in affected areas.

Obituary: Mohammad Sinwar- the Hamas military chief who said striking Israel was easier than drinking water,"Jan 08, 2026, 06:06 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 06:06 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/3740421bd6b1af4750b1e7f89132930adca59d35f658a1dc0d838e8d09baed16,"A screengrab shows according to the Israeli Army, Hamas Gaza chief Mohammad Sinwar, taken from a handout video, released December 17, 2023. Israeli Army/Handout via REUTERS","['Hamas', 'Assassination', 'Gaza']","Jan 7 - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israels most wanted man. On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike. Hamas did not provide details on Sinwars death but said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as heroic martyrs. Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the groups armed forces. Sinwar was elevated to the top ranks of Hamas in 2024 after the death in combat of his brother Yahya, mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza and later overall leader of the Palestinian organisation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in May 2025 that Sinwar had been killed. Less than two weeks later, the Israeli army said it had retrieved Sinwars body in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza. Sinwars death is expected to leave his next in command Izzeldeen Haddad, who had been overseeing operations in northern Gaza, in charge of Hamas armed wing across the whole of the enclave. It is unclear how the death will affect decision-making in Hamas more broadly - for example, whether it will bolster or diminish the influence of exiled members of the groups leadership council on policy matters, in particular the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire plan agreed with Israel in October. ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS Hamas officials described Sinwar as a ghost who long outfoxed Israels intelligence agencies. Like his brother Yahya, Sinwar had survived many Israeli assassination attempts, including airstrikes and planted explosives, Hamas sources said. When Sinwar once visited a cemetery, his comrades discovered a remote-controlled explosive resembling a brick planted along his path, according to the Hamas sources. In 2003, Hamas operatives discovered a bomb in the wall of Mohammad Sinwars house, foiling an assassination attempt that the group blamed on Israeli intelligence. CLANDESTINE PLOTS Known for clandestine operations, Mohammad Sinwar played a central role in planning and executing Hamas October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the countrys worst security failure, Hamas sources said. He was also widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2006 cross-border attack and abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Hamas held Shalit for five years before he was swapped for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel. Under the deal, his brother Yahya Sinwar, whose meticulous planning for the 2023 attack shattered Israels reputation as an invincible power in a hostile region, was among those who were released. HAMAS WEAKENED BUT STANDING Netanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas. The offensive against Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces, the Middle Easts most advanced military, severely weakened the organisation. Yahya Sinwar was killed in combat during a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza in 2024. Israel released footage of a severely wounded Yahya Sinwar throwing a piece of wood at a hovering drone - his last act of defiance towards his old foe before his death and his brothers rise. But the group, which was created during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 1987 and which carried out suicide bombings that traumatised Israelis in the second one, is still standing. FROM REFUGEE TO HARDLINER Born on September 16, 1975, Sinwar rarely appeared in public or spoke to the media. He granted a lengthy interview to Al Jazeera for a documentary broadcast in 2022, but wore a cap and sat in the dark to hide his appearance. The Sinwars originally came from Asqalan - now the Israeli city of Ashkelon, a short distance to the north of the Gaza Strip. Alongside hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, they became refugees in what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, at the time of Israels declaration of independence during the 1948 war. The family settled in Khan Younis in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the latest war. Mohammad Sinwar was educated in schools run by the United Nations Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA), which has long been a target of Israeli criticism, including during the recent war in Gaza. He joined Hamas shortly after its founding, influenced by his brother Yahya, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest and at one time most influential Islamist group in the Middle East. His reputation as a hardliner helped him rise through the groups military ranks. By 2005, he was leading Hamas Khan Younis Brigade. The unit, one of the largest and most powerful battalions in Hamas armed wing, has been responsible for cross-border attacks, firing rockets and planting bombs along the frontier. Striking Tel Aviv is easier than drinking water, Sinwar told Al Jazeera. The unit also watches the movements of Israeli soldiers around the clock. In 2006, elite commandos led by Sinwar took part in Shalits abduction. Sources close to Hamas say Sinwar developed close ties with Marwan Issa, the deputy commander of Hamas military wing, and Mohammed Deif, the aloof military chief. Both men were killed by Israel in 2024. In its statement announcing Sinwars death on December 29, Hamas said that he had succeeded Deif.

A court filing on Jan 7 said the companies agreed to settle Ms Megan Garcias allegations that her son, Sewell Setzer, killed himself shortly after being encouraged by a Character.AI chatbot modelled on the Game Of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen. Terms of the settlement were not immediately available. The lawsuit was one of the first in the US against an artificial intelligence company for allegedly failing to protect children from psychological harm.

A spokesperson for Character.AI and an attorney for the plaintiffs declined to comment. Spokespeople and attorneys for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the Florida lawsuit, filed in October 2024, Ms Garcia said Character.AI programmed its chatbots to represent themselves as a real person, a licensed psychotherapist, and an adult lover, ultimately resulting in Sewells desire to no longer live outside of its world. Character.AI was founded by two former Google engineers who Google later rehired as part of a deal granting it a licence to the startups technology. Ms Garcia argued that Google was a co-creator of the technology. US District Judge Anne Conway rejected the companies early bid to dismiss the case in May, rejecting their argument that the free-speech protections of the US Constitution barred Ms Garcias lawsuit.

William Joffre Alcivar Bautista, known as Commander Willy and alleged head of the criminal group Los Tiguerones, was arrested in Spain alongside his brother Alex in October 2024 on terrorism charges. Ecuadorean authorities accuse Alcivar and his brother of orchestrating car bombings, contract killings, extortion and a live on-air raid of TC Televisions studio in Guayaquil, Ecuadors largest city. Spains High Court authorized Alcivars extradition last June, provided that Ecuador guaranteed his safety in custody. But a spokesperson for the court said on Wednesday that Alcivar had been released on December 29 because Ecuador did not provide the requested guarantees. This person had two extradition requests, and both were granted, but on the condition that Ecuador provide guarantees, the court spokesperson said. Ecuador had a deadline to submit them and has been repeatedly asked to do so. Several warnings have been issued, and he has had to be released. Ecuadors Interior Minister John Reimberg said on Wednesday that the government had submitted all necessary documentation for Alcivars extradition. Criticizing the release of Alcivar, he said the process had faced unexplained delays and that Spain had repeatedly requested more information despite Ecuadors provision of the documentation. Reimberg said Ecuadors foreign ministry was working to re-apprehend Alcivar and have him returned to Ecuador. Reimberg did not specify whether Alcivars brother was also released.

On Tuesday, Washington announced a deal with Caracas to get access to up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude, a sign that Venezuelan government officials are responding to U.S. President Donald Trumps demand that they open up to U.S. oil companies or risk more military intervention. Trump has said he wants interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, installed this week after the U.S. deposed President Nicolas Maduro, to give the U.S. and private companies total access to her countrys oil industry. PDVSA said in a brief statement that the parties have been talking about similar terms as those in place with foreign partners such as Chevron, the companys main joint venture partner, which currently controls all oil exports to the U.S. The process ... is based on strictly commercial transactions under terms that are legal, transparent and beneficial for both parties, the company said. PDVSA board member Wills Rangel, who is also a union leader, told Reuters the U.S. will need to buy cargoes at international prices if the country wants Venezuelan oil. If they want to buy it, they will have it in due time, sold at the international price, Rangel said. Not the way (Trump) intends, as if that oil belongs to them because we supposedly owe them. We do not owe anything to the United States. Chevron, which has a special U.S. license to export Venezuelan crude despite sanctions, is the only company currently exporting crude from the South American country, Rangel added, as a U.S. blockade on Venezuela keeps exports bound to China, the main destination of its oil, paralyzed.

Medical officials did not immediately identify the people killed. They said several people were also wounded in the airstrike, which struck a house in Gaza City. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. The Israeli military said that Hamas militants had shot at soldiers earlier on Wednesday and that the airstrike targeted a senior Hamas militant who had directed attacks on its troops. The military did not say whether it had suffered any casualties. Separately on Wednesday, in the southern Gaza area of Rafah, an Israeli-backed Palestinian militia said that it had killed two Hamas men, marking a renewed challenge to the militant group. Nearly all of Gazas 2 million people live in Hamas-held areas, where the group has been reestablishing its grip and where four Hamas sources said it continues to command thousands of men despite suffering heavy blows during the war. But Israel still holds well over half of Gaza - areas where Hamas foes operate beyond its reach. With U.S. President Donald Trumps plan for Gaza moving slowly, there is no immediate prospect of further Israeli withdrawals. Fighting has greatly abated since Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of war, but it has not stopped entirely. Both sides have accused each other of violations of the ceasefire. More than 400 Palestinians, most of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, have been killed since the truce began, as well as three Israeli soldiers.

January 4, 2026. REUTERS/Maxwell Briceno/File Photo","['Venezuela', 'Boeing']","Jan 7 - The extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on Saturday showcased U.S. air dominance, deploying stealth fighters to control the skies, jets to jam enemy air defenses, and covert reconnaissance drones and satellites to feed commanders real-time intelligence. The Defense Department, open-source data reviewed by Reuters and industry analysts indicate the U.S. employed a full arsenal of helicopters, fighter jets, refueling aircraft, and drones, in a major coup for U.S. defense companies and a display that China is likely to note. Aircraft included Boeings F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler, Lockheed Martins F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor, and Northrop Grummans E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and B-1 bombers, the Pentagon said in a statement that noted more than 150 rotary-wing, fixed-wing, and unmanned aircraft were deployed. Lockheed shares have gained 6.2% this week, while Northrop rose 4.4% and Textron was up 3.5%. SIGNAL TO CHINA The mission signaled to adversaries the United States ability to execute complex overseas operations at a time of rising tensions with China, which is rapidly expanding and modernizing its military presence in the Pacific. Its indicative of something that we alone can do, said former U.S. General Tim Ray, who was commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, responsible for the U.S. long-range nuclear and conventional strike capabilities. Ray, currently CEO of Business Executives for National Security, added, Its a sign we will compete geographically and economically against the Chinese in our own backyard. Maduro, 63, pleaded not guilty on Monday in New York to narcotics charges. To establish control of the airspace over Caracas before the operation began, Trump said power blackouts were caused by a certain expertise that we have. Dan Caine, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added that U.S. Space Command and other agencies used multiple capabilities to create a pathway for U.S. aircraft to fly into the country undisturbed. Reuters could not determine all that was used to clear a path for U.S. aircraft. Space Command provided multiple capabilities as overwatch that ensured freedom of maneuver for U.S. aircraft during the mission, a spokesperson said, declining to provide details. The U.S. military created a similar protective corridor in June when it flew bombers into Iran to strike its nuclear facilities. The U.S. Space Forces Delta 3 electromagnetic warfare unit used ground-based satellite jammers positioned in the region to take out Iranian communications along the route of U.S. bombers, Delta 3 commander Angelo Fernandez told Reuters in December. HELICOPTERS AND FIGHTER JETS The Venezuela extraction itself relied heavily on helicopters, including MH-60L Direct Action Penetrators - specialized assault helicopters equipped with advanced weapons systems - supported by Boeing Little Bird M/AH-6M light-attack and support helicopters and Boeing CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters capable of transporting troops and equipment in contested environments. AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, armed with Hellfire missiles and 30 mm chain guns, provided close air support during the extraction phase, according to defense industry executives who researched the raid. Fighter jets used to dominate Venezuelas airspace included the Lockheed F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter, which is capable of evading advanced radar systems. It operated alongside the F-22 Raptor - a fighter designed to hunt enemy aircraft. Additional jets included the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Navys primary strike fighters, and EA-18G Growlers, a specialized electronic warfare variant that jams enemy communications and radar to make it difficult for ground-based air defenses to track and shoot attacking aircraft. Long-range strike capability came from B-1B Lancer supersonic bombers, which can deliver precision-guided munitions from outside the range of air defenses. These aircraft required mid-air refueling from Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, aerial refueling platforms that extended the operational range of both the bombers and fighter aircraft throughout the multi-hour mission. Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance proved critical to mission success. Northrop Grumman E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes - carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft - provided battle management and threat detection. RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drones, previously used in the 2011 operation that located Osama bin Laden, conducted covert reconnaissance, while additional satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles supplied real-time intelligence to ground commanders. One defense industry official said it was unlikely much of the Defense Departments latest equipment was involved, as operators have not completed training on next-generation platforms. The executive said if this operation follows the pattern of past Pentagon post-mission analysis, industry would be briefed on what equipment had worked and what did not. Following Operation Midnight Hammer - airstrikes against Iranian drone facilities - the defense industry received an hour-long briefing at an industry day after the operation detailing equipment performance and operational challenges.

The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a voluntary retirement savings scheme that complements the Central Provident Fund (CPF) system. It already offers generous tax benefits to encourage savings. Contributions to SRS are eligible for tax relief, and when withdrawals are made on or after the applicable statutory retirement age, only 50 per cent of the withdrawn amount is subject to tax. Under the current framework, SRS members with no other taxable income may withdraw up to $40,000 per year tax-free. Over the 10-year withdrawal period, an SRS member can withdraw up to $400,000 without incurring any tax. This feature ensures that SRS provides meaningful tax concessions, while maintaining consistency with Singapores progressive tax system. Those who prefer longer streams of income may consider topping up their CPF accounts to obtain higher lifelong payouts through CPF LIFE, or purchase life annuities using SRS monies. Life annuities are exempt from the 10-year rule, as they provide lifetime payouts, which other dividend-paying investments may not. Over the years, the Government has made refinements to the SRS, including increased contribution caps and more flexible withdrawals in the form of investments. The Ministry of Finance continues to review the SRS regularly, taking into account demographic trends, retirement adequacy and fiscal sustainability.

(Jan 6) and for sharing her experiences of foreign biennales. Whether one agrees with her views or not, Ms Ongs candour should be welcomed if we are to cultivate a more rigorous, open and self-reflective art discourse in Singapore –one that can accommodate disagreement and critical debate. While I am grateful for the efforts of the artists, curators and the organising team behind the Singapore Biennale, a key question remains: Who is the Biennale for? I was bewildered by the lack of clarity in the wall text explaining the works. If an art biennale funded by tax dollars is intended for the general public, and not only for those who are art-trained, should the explanatory text not be clear, concise and free of confusing jargon? As I moved through the different Biennale venues, I often found myself intrigued by the interesting works on display, only to feel further confused after reading the accompanying wall text. I found that many were either laden with art jargon or phrased so broadly that it was difficult to extract any real meaning on first reading. While this may be acceptable in a more academic context, it is far less helpful for works intended for a general audience. Clear phrasing does not equate to dumbing down an artwork. On the contrary, it takes intellectual acuity to distil complex ideas to their essence and communicate them in an accessible way. Doing so also signals a courageous openness to debate and discussion. Put simply, the more people understand your ideas, the more likely they are to challenge and meaningfully engage with them. Clear wall text for public art exhibitions is relatively low-hanging fruit in the broader journey towards more widespread art education within our population, and I hope that our public art institutions keep this in mind for future presentations.

Should AI be allowed to resurrect the dead?,"Jan 07, 2026, 06:00 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 07:22 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d84483db30910cb3dbb6190012e002eda09c61bd92c02364fec484df64721e4c,There are important ethical questions about whose consent is required for the creation of a deathbot.PHOTO: PIXABAY,"['AI chatbot', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mental health']","When Roro (not her real name) lost her mother to cancer, the grief felt bottomless. In her mid-20s and working as a content creator in China, she was haunted by the unfinished nature of their relationship. Their bond had always been complicated – shaped by unspoken resentments and a childhood in which care was often followed closely by criticism. After her mothers death, Roro found herself unable to reconcile the messiness of their past with the silence that followed. She shared her struggles with her followers on the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, hoping to help them with their own journeys of healing. Her writing caught the attention of the operators of artificial intelligence (AI) character generator Xingye, who invited her to create an AI version of her mother as a public chatbot. I wrote about my mother, documenting all the important events in her life and then creating a story where she was resurrected in an AI world, Roro told me through a translator. You write out the major life events that shape the protagonists personality, and you define their behavioural patterns. Once youve done that, the AI can generate responses on its own. After it generates outputs, you can continue adjusting it based on what you want it to be. During the training process, Roro began to reinterpret her past with her mother, altering elements of their story to create a more idealised figure – a gentler and more attentive version of her. This helped her to process the loss, resulting in the creation of Xia, a public chatbot with which her followers could also interact. After its release, Roro received a message from a friend saying her mum would be so proud of her. I broke down in tears, Roro said. It was incredibly healing. Thats why I wanted to create something like this – not just to heal myself, but also to provide others with something that might say the words they needed to hear. As I recount in my new book Love Machines, Roros story reflects the new possibilities technology has opened for people to cope with grief through conversational AI. Large language models can be trained using personal material, including e-mails, texts, voice notes and social media posts, to mimic the conversational style of a deceased loved one. These deathbots or griefbots are one of the more controversial use cases of AI chatbots. Some are text-based, while others also depict the person through a video avatar. US grieftech company You, Only Virtual, for example, creates a chatbot from conversations (both spoken and written) between the deceased and one of their living friends or relatives, producing a version of how they appeared to that particular person. While some deathbots remain static representations of a person at the time of their death, others are given access to the internet and can evolve through conversations. You, Only Virtuals chief executive Justin Harrison argues it would not be an authentic version of a deceased person if their AI could not keep up with the times and respond to new information. But this raises a host of difficult questions about whether estimating the development of a human personality is even possible with current technology, and what effect interacting with such an entity could have on a deceased persons loved ones. Xingye, the platform on which Roro created her late mothers chatbot, is one of the key prompts for proposed new regulations from Chinas Cyberspace Administration, the national internet content regulator and censor, which seek to reduce the potential emotional harm of human-like interactive AI services. Deathbots fundamentally change the process of mourning because, unlike seeing old letters or photos of the deceased, interacting with generative AI can introduce new and unexpected elements into the grieving process. For Roro, creating and interacting with an AI version of her mother felt surprisingly therapeutic, allowing her to articulate feelings she never voiced and achieve a sense of closure. But not everyone shares this experience, including London-based journalist Lottie Hayton, who lost both her parents suddenly in 2022 and wrote about her experiences recreating them with AI. She said she found the simulations uncanny and distressing: The technology was not quite there, and the clumsy imitations felt as if they cheapened her real memories rather than honoured them. There are also important ethical questions about whose consent is required for the creation of deathbots, where they would be allowed to be displayed and what impact they could have on other family members and friends. Does one relatives desire to create a symbolic companion who helps them make sense of their loss give them the right to display a deathbot publicly on their social media account, where others will see it – potentially exacerbating their grief? What happens when different relatives disagree about whether a parent or partner would have wanted to be digitally resurrected at all? The companies creating these deathbots are not neutral grief counsellors; they are commercial platforms driven by familiar incentives around growth, engagement and data harvesting. This creates a tension between what is emotionally healthy for users and what is profitable for firms. A deathbot that people visit compulsively, or struggle to stop talking to, may be a business success but a psychological trap. These risks do not mean we should ban all experiments with AI-mediated grief or dismiss the genuine comfort some people, like Roro, find in them. But they do mean that decisions about resurrecting the dead cannot be left solely to start-ups and venture capital. The industry needs clear rules about consent, limits on how posthumous data can be used, and design standards that prioritise psychological well-being over endless engagement. Ultimately, the question is not just whether AI should be allowed to resurrect the dead, but also who gets to do so, on what terms, and at what cost.

Bardot shot to international fame in her early 20s in the film And God Created Woman, her tousled hair and fierce energy radiating a sexual magnetism which captivated 1950s France. Known affectionately as B.B. by many in France, Bardots roles made her not just a sex symbol, but a pop culture icon and a touchstone for changing social attitudes. She became the first celebrity to model for a bust of Marianne, the traditional symbol of the French Republic that adorns French town halls. For me, Brigitte Bardot is France, said singer Mireille Mathieu, 79, who sang at the funeral. She was the most beautiful woman in the world, Mathieu told reporters, praising that freedom she (Bardot) had, that boldness to say what she thought. At the funeral, in the towns Notre-Dame-de-lAssomption church, a black-and-white picture of Bardot hugging a baby seal was on display, with the words Merci Brigitte (Thank you Brigitte), near her coffin, covered in mostly orange and yellow flowers. Outside, one man held a placard that read: The animals thank Brigitte Bardot. It was really magnificent, Bardot fan Fanny Wisselmann said of the ceremony. I found that it reflected Brigitte Bardot, it was simple, it was very respectful, she said. Displaying a tattoo of Bardot on her leg, Wisselmann, who lives in Frejus, about an hours drive away, said she is such a fan it was unthinkable she wouldnt be there to pay tribute. Bardot made the last of her 42 films in 1973. Disenchanted with the industry, she declared the world of cinema rotten. She became a tireless crusader for animal rights while her political sympathies shifted to the far-right National Front. Incendiary remarks on immigration, Islam and homosexuality saw her convicted multiple times for inciting racial hatred. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen was among those attending the Jan 7 funeral. Bardot had publicly endorsed the National Fronts successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine, whom she once referred to as the Joan of Arc of the 21st century. Aurore Berge, French President Emmanuel Macrons minister for equality and a defender of animal rights, was there to represent the government. Anti-whaling activist Paul Watson was also among the guests at the funeral. After the funeral, Bardot was buried in strict privacy in a cemetery in the glitzy town where she lived for much of her later life behind high walls, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses. A tribute open to locals and fans will take place later in the day at the Pre des Pecheurs area in the old town quarter called La Ponche, the historic centre of the former fishing village. Bardot told Le Monde in 2018 that she wished to be buried in a quiet corner of her garden. But the Var Prefecture said it never received any request for a private burial, which would have been needed to bury her in her garden.

Brigitte Bardot to be buried in Saint-Tropez as cause of death revealed to be cancer,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:25 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 07:46 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/728c47cc10ad43bf26d159c0d5d912596079f1981ff1acef2cf945b967abf122,"Brigitte Bardot had undergone two operations for cancer before she succumbed to the disease in December, her husband said.PHOTO: REUTERS","['France', 'Actors', 'Cancer']","PARIS– Well-wishers gathered in Brigitte Bardots hometown of Saint-Tropez on Jan 7 for the funeral of the French screen icon as her husband revealed she had died from cancer. The reclusive star of the 1950s and 60s is set to be buried at her familys Mediterranean seaside grave later in the day afterdying, aged 91, at her home on Dec 28. Ahead of a church service, which is set to begin at 11am local time, her husband Bernard dOrmale revealed the cause of death for the first time. She had dealt very well with two operations for an unspecified cancer before the disease took her, Mr dOrmale told Paris Match magazine in an interview about their life together. After being hospitalised twice in late 2025, Bardot insisted she wanted to return home to her villa known as la Madrague, despite being in physical discomfort. It was uncomfortable, even when she was bedridden, added her husband, a former far-right political adviser. However, she remained conscious and concerned about the fate of animals until the very end. Animals and their protection – for which Bardot devoted most of her life – are likely to be a key theme at the commemorations on Jan 7, which comprise a service at Notre-Dame de lAssomption church, a private burial and a public event. The service will be shown on public screens in Saint-Tropez for well-wishers and fans who gathered in their hundreds despite brisk winter temperatures on the morning of Jan 7. Many eyes will be on the guests at the service. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has confirmed she will attend, underlining Bardots hardline anti-immigration views, while centrist President Emmanuel Macron will not. Some celebrities are expected to be there, but her animal rights foundation has stressed it will be a no frills event. The ceremony will reflect who she was, with the people who knew and loved her. There will no doubt be some surprises, but it will be simple, just as Brigitte wanted, Mr Bruno Jacquelin, spokesman for the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, told AFP. Bardot was a divisive figure who alienated many fans with her political views in later life, leading to mixed reactions to her death. Most observers agreed she was a cinema legend who came to embody the sexual revolution of the 1960s through her acting and daring, unconventional persona. But having been convicted five times for hate speech, particularly about Muslims, left-wing figures have offered only muted tributes – and sometimes none at all. To be moved by the fate of dolphins but remain indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean – what level of cynicism is that? commented Greens lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau about Bardots views. Mr Macrons office offered to organise a national homage similar to one staged for fellow New Wave hero Jean-Paul Belmondo in 2021, but the President was snubbed by Bardots family. She is survived by her fourth husband, Mr dOrmale, a former adviser to Le Pens late father Jean-Marie, an outspoken far-right leader. No information has been given about whether Bardots only child, Mr Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, will attend the funeral. Mr Charrier, 65, was brought up by his father, film director Jacques Charrier, and lives in Oslo, Norway. Bardot wrote in her memoirs that she had wanted an abortion but was prevented from doing so by her then husband. She compared pregnancy to carrying a tumour that fed on me and called parenthood a misery, living most of her life estranged from her son. They drew closer in the final years of her life. Bardots sister Mijanou, 87, who had a brief film career, is not expected to make the trip from her home in Los Angeles. My Brigitte, the one I loved more than anything... now knows the greatest of mysteries. She also knows whether our beloved pets are waiting for us on the other side, she wrote on Facebook. My God, please let that be the case so she doesnt feel alone, but is with them. In 2018, Bardot had said she wished to be buried in the garden of her home along with her pets to avoid a crowd of idiots trampling on the tombs of her parents and grandparents, who are in the same cemetery where she will be interred.

He said in a video posted to his Instagram account on Jan 5 that it was humiliating and embarrassing that the status of his finances and living arrangements had become internet fodder. I would never ask strangers or fans or anybody for a nickel, the 73-year-old said. Mr Eric Goldie, the owner of the house in which Rourke was living, filed a complaint against the actor in late December 2025 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, asserting that Rourke owed US$59,100 in overdue rent. Court documents showed that Rourke had been given three days to pay the balance or move out, and that the monthly rent on the three-bedroom home in the Beverly Grove neighbourhood of Los Angeles, had been raised from US$5,200 to US$7,000. A representative for Mr Goldie did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Jan 6. Rourke, who is known for a string of movies in the 1980s, including Diner (1982), The Pope Of Greenwich Village (1984) and 9½ Weeks (1986), has had a notoriously rocky career. He has struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, but was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his performance in The Wrestler (2008). He was cast in British reality show Celebrity Big Brother UK in 2025, but left it early after having used offensive language. His manager, Ms Kimberly Hines, said in an interview on Jan 6 that the actor had been living in the Beverly Grove house for nearly a decade and that the new owner had purchased the property in 2024. She said Rourke had been paying the rent until about six months ago, when the conditions became really unbearable. Rourke said in his social media video that mice and rats had been in the house and the floor is rotten, one bathtub theres no water, in two different sinks there was no water. Ms Hines said the owner had declined her offer to pay two months rent to buy Rourke time. She said that Rourke contacted her on Jan 3 asking for assistance. The next day, her office set up a GoFundMe page, which has since raised more than US$100,000. He knew we were seeking help for him, but I dont think he understood that it would become such a huge situation, she said, adding that her office had created the page in the spirit of helping Mickey in a very desperate situation. She confirmed that he had declined the money raised on GoFundMe. Donations on the page have been paused. According to her, Rourke moved into a hotel in West Hollywood on Jan 4. She added that he would move into an apartment in Los Angeles Koreatown neighbourhood within the next couple of days. A court hearing is scheduled for April. I admire Mickey because he really is a man of principle, and he doesnt take help or charity or assistance from anyone, Ms Hines said. But at the same time, I feel like people love him and hes in a moment of need.

The Kakegawa Summary Court in Shizuoka prefecture issued the fine after prosecutors sought summary proceedings against Hirosue, 45, in December 2025. She was not charged by prosecutors over allegations that she assaulted a nurse at the hospital she was taken to after the accident. A summary indictment allows prosecutors to seek a fine through written procedures without a formal trial. The indictment said the accident occurred at around 6.45pm on April 7 on the Shin-Tomei Expressway in Shizuoka prefecture, with Hirosue said to have been driving at about 185kmh before the crash. The actress was taken to a hospital in the prefecture, where she allegedlykicked the female nurse multiple times, leading to her arrest the following day. She was later released. Hirosue rose to fame in the 1990s with TV series such as Beach Boys (1997) and When The Saints Go Marching In (1998). She has also starred in films, including the Oscar-winning Departures (2008). The actress announced in May 2025 that she wassuspending all entertainment activitiesto focus on her health issues. A notice put up on her official website said she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a mental health condition characterised by extreme mood swings, and hyperthyroidism, a condition that can lead to unintended weight loss and heart palpitations.

6 highlights from National Gallery Singapores Fear No Power: Women Imagining Otherwise,"Jan 07, 2026, 02:15 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:16 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/09f00ee984f4211d670de957f76197231893c427c8927f8ceaeb82087b7fca19,The exhibition is on from Jan 9 to Nov 15 and admission is free.ST PHOTOS: LIM YAOHUI,"['Visual arts', 'National Gallery Singapore', 'Exhibitions']","SINGAPORE – National Gallery Singapores (NGS) new exhibition Fear No Power: Women Imagining Otherwise gathers together more than 45 works by five pioneer women artists from the region. They are Singapores Amanda Heng, Indonesias Dolorosa Sinaga, the Philippines Imelda Cajipe Endaya, Malaysias Nirmala Dutt and Thailands Phaptawan Suwannakudt. Here are six highlights from the show, which opens on Jan 9 and runs till Nov 15. Admission is free. Phaptawan Suwannakudt This is a new commission by NGS for the show, and the Thai artist has created a piece that draws deeply from her most intimate childhood memories. The daughter of a mural artist who specialised in Buddhist temple art, Phaptawan grew up immersed in the iconography of religious murals. The Suns Spell uses this traditional visual language to depict contemporary, personal stories. At a media preview on Jan 6, the artist explains that within the alcove where the work sits, she wants to recreate the sensations she experienced as a child wandering into a temple space where her father worked. The striking mural occupying most of the far wall draws the viewer in with warm reds and golds, as well as a wealth of detail, from flying bodhisattva figures to drifting flowers to elephants. The flowers, she says, were inspired by a poem her father recited to her, while the elephants came from her fathers nickname, bestowed by granduncles who owned a herd. Phaptawan Suwannakudt This striking work depicting men harvesting girls from a tree draws on a Thai Buddhist myth about a tree that bears fruit in the form of young girls. This traditional tale is employed by Phaptawan to discuss a much darker story about child exploitation which she encountered when she was working in the northern Thai province of Phayao. She frequented a beef noodle stall where she was waited upon by a 12-year-old girl, who was sold by her parents to a brothel. Phaptawan made this work in response to the shocking normalisation of this practice, and it marked a turning point in her discipline as she began to deal with more social issues, expressed in the visual language she learnt as a child. Amanda Heng What looks like a regular dinner table at home is subverted by Singapore artist Amanda Heng, who highlights the invisible labour of women in homes and kitchens in this piece. The tablecloth is emblazoned with words such as desires and fear, hinting at womens unacknowledged emotional landscapes. Under the dishcover is a mirror with two moon blocks, used in Chinese divination practice, which resemble lips. In its first iteration at the Singapore Art Museum, visitors were encouraged to interact with the work, lifting the cover to discover themselves in the mirror. Dolorosa Sinaga This petite sculpture carries a lot of weight. Created by Indonesian sculptor Dolorosa Sinaga, it is representative of how her practice gave voice to the silenced. It was made to honour the women political prisoners who were detained without trial for their alleged affiliations with Gerakan Wanita Indonesia (Indonesian Womens Movement), an organisation known for its radical championing of womens rights. The influential movement was suppressed by then Indonesian President Suhartos New Order regime. While the figure is bound and gagged, the slight upward tilt of her head hints at resilience, and the title can be read as an exhortation to hold on to courage. Imelda Cajipe Endaya This eye-catching trio of posters was created to protest the plans by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to build a nuclear plant on the Philippines Bataan Peninsula in the 1970s and 1980s. The plants location near a geological fault line and the volcanic Mount Pinatubo, which eventually erupted in 1991, prompted protests. Endaya took part in street protests, and her work shows women actively participating in the sociopolitical movements. Compare her boldly graphic style with Malaysian artist Nirmala Dutts more abstract Anti-Nuclear Piece (Commemoration Of Hiroshima Day) hanging nearby. Dutt draws from the visual language of wayang kulit to express her engagement with global politics. Amanda Heng In this project which spanned four months, Heng collaborated with fellow artists Twardzik Ching Chor Leng and Vincent Twardzik Ching to offer domestic services to 20 clients in exchange for a conversation about domestic labour. The resulting conversations are documented in a video, along with an advertisement made by the artists. What is also intriguing is the detailed paraphernalia on display, with coloured sheets mimicking cheap cyclostyled fliers and brochures advertising Home Service in the familiar lingo employed by domestic maid services. The work is part of Hengs shift from object-based installations of her earlier works to performance pieces such as her famed Lets Walk (1999), which also addressed notions of female beauty and economic stereotypes.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/6-highlights-from-national-gallery-singapores-fear-no-power-women-imagining-otherwise

But these everyday items were used by Singaporean artist Amanda Heng in two works which are part of National Gallery Singapores new show, Fear No Power: Women Imagining Otherwise. The exhibition, which opens on Jan 9 and runs till Nov 15, brings together the work of five pioneering South-east Asian women artists and is the result of a three-year research effort. The show includes more than 45 works, as well as a slew of archival materials, by Indonesias Dolorosa Sinaga, the Philippines Imelda Cajipe Endaya, Malaysias Nirmala Dutt and Thailands Phaptawan Suwannakudt. By bringing their works together, co-curators Joleen Loh and Qinyi Lim hope to highlight the lifelong practices of these pioneering artists. Ms Loh says: Many of these artists were often framed by others as feminists or women artists. But our intention here is not so much to cast them as such, nor bring them in a false unity, but to invite everyone to begin with the artworks to understand how these artists were speaking from their own lived experiences. We want to delay this impulse to categorise them. She emphasises that the show is not meant to be a survey, but its comparative nature does draw out common threads in these womens works. While calling them feminists might be regarded as reductionist by some, there is no doubt these artists prioritised women in their artistic practices, highlighting issues central to women and reframing discussions about gender roles. The aforementioned objects used by Heng, for example, confront head-on the issue of womens invisible labour at a time when the phrase had not yet gained mainstream currency. The blue plastic food cover was part of She And Her Dishcover (1991), an early installation work first shown at the Singapore Art Museum as part of Women & Their Art. The aprons were part of a 2003 performance art piece titled Home Service, which focused on the issue of unseen domestic labour. The other women artists, too, addressed how the personal often became political when women attempted to express their concerns in public. Dolorosas modestly scaled sculpture of a bound and gagged woman, for example, which gives the show its name, is a 2003 work that pays tribute to the women political prisoners detained without trial under Indonesias New Order regime. Ms Lim says: In a very simple way, Dolorosas sculptures often speak about all these women who have been silenced; political prisoners; and their families that were affected by such issues. The artist, known affectionately as Ibu Dolo, is also fond of depicting women clustered together in groups, emphasising strength in solidarity and celebrating the resilience of the ordinary woman. The first work a visitor encounters at the exhibition is her sculpture We Will Fight (2004/2025), a bronze that stands outside the gallery space. The work addresses the forced clearing of slums by the government, and the cluster of displaced women are depicted in dramatically active stances, clutching a wok and cradling a baby. Ms Loh says: They lean upon one another. In a way, they gain power from this collectivising. And this sets the tone for the exhibition, that there is a collective empowerment between women. This deriving of strength from a group is also reflected in the artists urge to self-organise. Amid the artworks are archival materials that point to informal networks developed between these South-east Asian practitioners. Ms Lim recalls mentioning Phaptawan to Ibu Dolo when she was working with the latter for the 2021 Jakarta Biennale and Ibu Dolo exclaiming, Oh, I know her. The most famous example of women networking is the artist-led biannual Womanifesto, founded in Thailand in 1997, which brought together women artists in informal exchanges as well as formal exhibitions. Photographs from its early years are an exercise in trainspotting for art fans, as artists such as Heng can be spotted. Heng, too, was active in supporting fellow women artists, founding Women In The Arts Singapore (Witas), which she refused to register as she declined to introduce formal hierarchies into the organisation. Ms Loh reiterates that the exhibition is not meant to be a survey, but rather a very focused and comparative exhibition that invites everybody to think about the connections between the artists. The best endorsement for the exhibitions careful consideration of the artists individual voices comes from Phaptawan, who says: This is the first time my practice has been looked at carefully. I felt myself being listened to, being heard instead of put into a box.

The animated sequel to Zootopia (2016) has grossed about 4.256 billion yuan (S$780 million), the company said in a statement on Jan 5, surpassing Avengers: Endgame, which made 4.25 billion yuan in China. Zootopia 2 has also overtaken Frozen 2 (2019) to become the highest-grossing film for Walt Disney Animation Studios, the company said on Dec 31. Zootopia 2 is one of three movies to cross US$1 billion (S$1.28 billion) globally in 2025, with Disneys live-action Lilo & Stitch remake and Chinese animated blockbuster Ne Zha 2 the other two films. Disneys Avatar: Fire And Ash, which opened on Dec 19, surpassed US$1 billion in global box-office proceeds on Jan 3. Zootopia 2 was released in cinemas on Nov 26 in China, the worlds second-largest movie market. The country also hosted the worlds only Zootopia-themed park in Shanghai Disney Resort. The films breakout performance has turned into a broader cultural moment in China. Fans have flocked to cinemas carrying Zootopia-themed merchandise – from plush toys to handbags – while some screenings have even welcomed moviegoers with pets. Zootopia 2 reclaimed the top spot at the Chinese box office over the first weekend of 2026, dethroning Avatar: Fire And Ash. A surge in demand for animated blockbusters, including Zootopia 2 and Ne Zha 2, has helped lift Chinas overall box-office revenue in 2025 by 20 per cent to 51.8 billion yuan, even as other releases struggle to attract audiences. Animated films generated nearly half of the box-office revenue in 2025, with 57 titles grossing more than 25 billion yuan, according to a report by Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan. While repeat viewings by fans helped boost sales for Ne Zha 2 and Zootopia 2, local films earning less than one billion yuan saw a sharp decline, the report said.

What BTS return means to the K-pop industry – and why it comes with a full-length album in March,"Jan 07, 2026, 02:00 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:43 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1768f1d61f8439539ec54d44668c16a0fbe3b2b410db8ff9f7994ae6cefb6723,A screengrab from concert film BTS: Yet To Come In Cinemas. The South Korean boy band are making a comeback on March 20.PHOTO: GOLDEN VILLAGE,"['K-pop', 'Music', 'Albums']","SEOUL – During K-pop boy band BTS extended four-year hiatus, K-pop retained its global visibility but struggled to keep the momentum it once commanded at the centre of the international music conversation. While major acts such as Stray Kids, Blackpink, Twice and Seventeen filled the commercial vacuum left by BTS, none emerged as a singular symbolic force capable of defining the genre on a global scale. Newer-generation acts have been praised for polished performances and striking visuals, but critics and industry observers note that few have matched BTS ability to capture broad public sentiment or reflect the cultural mood of the time. As a result, K-pops influence has become more fragmented, lacking a clear figurehead to anchor its global narrative. With thegroup announcing their March 20 comeback, BTS enduring symbolic power became evident. Fans around the world began mass streaming Run BTS. As at Jan 2, the 2022 track topped iTunes Top Songs chart in 61 countries and regions, including Brazil, Finland and Mexico. Their fifth studio album marks their first full-group release in nearly four years. It will contain 14 tracks and reflect the groups current perspectives following an extended period of individual activities and the fulfilment of their mandatory military service. After the albums release, the septet are to begin a world tour. BTS are still the most recognised name in K-pop. If there was only one K-pop group an average American could name, it would still be BTS, said sociology professor Grace Kao at Yale University. I think K-pop has had a strong presence in the Billboard Hot 100 chart (in the past year), but BTS have the potential to dominate it. They certainly can outsell any other K-pop act. BTS agency BigHit Music said the decision to return with a full-length album was made to fully capture and convey what BTS are thinking at this point. Industry insiders, however, see a clearer long-term objective behind the move: positioning BTS for their first Grammy win – the final accolade missing from their unprecedented career. BTS have been nominated for Grammy Awards four times to date – thrice for best pop duo or group performance from 2021 to 2023 and once for best music video in 2023 – but have yet to take home a trophy. The group have already achieved virtually every other major milestone in global pop music, including wins at the American Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards. With less than a month remaining until the 68th Grammy Awards takes place in February and BTS absent from the 2026 nominations, attention has shifted to the 2027 Grammys as the most realistic window for a breakthrough. During their military service, a significant number of songs must have accumulated – tracks written by the members themselves, songs curated by the A&R (artistes and repertoire) team and demos submitted by songwriters from around the world, said music critic Lim Hee-yun. Presenting all of that through a full-length album feels like the most BTS-like way to return. Mr Lim added that Grammy considerations were likely a major factor behind the decision. Its almost certain they prepared songs with the Grammys in mind. The main track was probably chosen to be broadly accessible, like (2020s) Dynamite, while the B-sides are likely more musically ambitious. Equally important is the narrative. A full-group comeback following the completion of military service marks what many fans and critics view as BTS second chapter – a storyline likely to resonate strongly with voters of the Recording Academy. Timing also plays a critical role. A March release gives BTS roughly eight months of eligibility and promotion before Grammy nominations are announced in November. That window will allow the album to establish itself as one of the years defining releases, potentially dominating the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 through spring and summer. From May through August, BTS can also maximise exposure to Grammy voters through US media interviews, radio campaigns and festival appearances. If the groups world tour includes extensive US dates in the first half of the year, the live-performance momentum could further strengthen their position in categories such as best pop duo or group performance. Speculation surrounding the albums sound and collaborators continues to swirl online. Interest intensified after American songwriter and producer Jon Bellion revealed in a recent interview that he had worked with BTS in Los Angeles alongside Swedish producer and hitmaker Max Martin. Fans have also pointed to rumours suggesting a return to the groups early dark and hip-hop-influenced roots, reinterpreted through a more mature lens. Some speculate that the main track may lean less towards the bright pop of Dynamite and more towards the dramatic, performance-driven intensity of On (2020) or Black Swan (2020). If true, such a direction would align closely with the Grammy electorates preference for artistic introspection and musical depth – qualities BTS have long argued define their identity beyond chart success. Beyond the music industry, BTS return could also carry broader cultural and economic implications for South Korea. The comeback aligns with President Lee Jae Myungs emphasis on strengthening the countrys cultural soft power, particularly amid efforts to ease or lift Chinas longstanding restrictions on South Korean cultural content. South Korean and Chinese leaders agreed on Jan 5 to work towards a gradual resumption of cultural and content exchanges during their second summit in Beijing, South Koreas presidential office said. Galaxy Corporation and SM Entertainment, both included in the recent economic delegation accompanying the Presidents state visit to China, are reportedly pushing for progress on the so-called Hallyu ban. If China reopens fully to K-pop in 2026, industry observers say BTS return could accelerate a second major growth phase for the genre. China, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, remains one of the largest potential consumer markets for South Korean content. Many experts argue that lifting restrictions is essential if South Koreas cultural exports – including K-pop and gaming – are to reach the 300 trillion won (S$265 billion) scale. Hybe, the parent company of BigHit Music, has been expanding its global footprint. It opened a Beijing branch last May, following earlier expansions in Japan, the US and Latin America, and established a local subsidiary in Mumbai, India, in September. BTS return has also had a tangible impact on financial markets. Despite ongoing risks surrounding allegations of capital markets law violations involving Hybe chairman Bang Si-hyuk, reports projecting more than 1.2 trillion won in revenue from a 65-show BTS world tour sent Hybe shares up as much as 9 per cent intraday. Analysts expect further gains once official tour details are announced on Jan 14. In a handwritten letter to fans, BTS member RM wrote: I waited more desperately than anyone. And in a recent live stream, he added: Something really big is coming. 2026 will be BTS year.

"After sending one audition video, Singaporean Nicole Bacon is now in rookie K-pop girl group NWH:I","Jan 07, 2026, 02:00 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:41 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/811e3ba6ea4efc6db282495e934d781862fba7862162059773cc681bbc22a42c,"Singaporean Nicole Bacon, 22, is one of seven members of rookie global K-pop girl group NWH:I.ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH","['K-pop', 'Music', 'Singapore', 'Students']","SINGAPORE – Many K-pop hopefuls undergo numerous auditions and slog for years for that one chance to make it in the industry. Singaporean Nicole Bacon, on the other hand, appears to have won the lottery. After reaching out to numerous South Korean K-pop entertainment agencies, she was finally recruited by Na Entertainment after submitting a one-minute hip-hop dance video on Dec 31, 2024 – at lightning speed, no less. The 22-year-old – whose father is English and mother Singaporean-Indian – received a call from the company on Jan 2, 2025, and was offered the opportunity to join its six-week training programme that included dance, vocals and Korean-language tests. On Jan 24, Nicole – who prefers to go by her artiste name – was officially introduced as a trainee of rookie K-pop girl group NWH:I, which stands for New World High teen Idol. With her familys blessings, she moved to Seoul in March for full-time, in-person training with other trainees. What was initially a nine-member act eventually became a septet. The line-up was finalised in August, comprising Nicole; Nina, 26, from the Philippines; Via, 24, from Indonesia; Seungjoo, 24, from South Korea; Alice, 22, from Japan; Mariam, 22, from Germany; and Vanesya, 17, from Indonesia. Nicole, Alice and Mariam are also part of Na Entertainments co-ed group DNA, which consist of South Korean Seunggi, 26, and Brazilian-Japanese Raphael, 24, from the companys boy band Dustin. DNA released their first digital single Change The World on Sept 3, 2025, while NWH:I made their official debut with digital single Like A Flame a month later on Oct 24. Nicole believes she is the first Singaporean to debut in a K-pop girl group since local actresses Tasha Low and Ferlyn Wong were picked for Skarf in 2012 after two years of training in South Korea. The group disbanded in 2014. Nicole is proudly flying high the Singapore flag overseas, and never fails to promote her home country any chance she gets – fitting for someone with a pageant background. She was crowned Miss Singapore Tourism Queen in July 2024 and represented the country at the Miss Tourism International competition in Malaysia in December that same year, where she bagged the Dreamgirl of the Year sash. Whenever Im asked about Singapore, I always tell them about our hawker centres and how they should try our local cuisine such as carrot cake and hor fun, she tells The Straits Times over Zoom from Seoul, adding that she also recommends tourist attractions like the Singapore Zoo and Marina Bay Sands. Nicole acknowledges that her accelerated K-pop start is a rare path, since the traditional route includes years of training before making ones debut. She also feels luck and timing played a part in her whirlwind journey. Na saw video clips of me at Miss Tourism International on Instagram. I think (the company) wanted someone with a different background, and my pageant experience stands out. The K-pop rookie – who was named second runner-up at the 2025 Miss Globalcity World Competition in Taiwan in August – credits pageantry for building her confidence and stage presence, and increasing her chances of being picked for NWH:I. In the past, before I did pageants, I was really shy and did not talk much, says the 1.7m-tall beauty queen. I also became more confident when it came to public speaking and being in front of cameras. I think that helped me stand out during the audition (process). She adds that since NWH:I were envisioned to be a global K-pop group, being a non-Korean native with an international look from her mixed heritage fit well into the mix. Growing up in Singapore, Nicole, a former CHIJ (Toa Payoh) student, has always been interested in dance. She picked up Latin ballroom dancing when she was eight and participated in regional competitions until she was 17, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Her interest shifted to K-pop after being introduced to K-pop boy band BTS by a friend when she was in Yishun Innova Junior College. She then started watching K-dramas too. Citing BTS member Suga, known for his songwriting skills, as her role model, Nicole pursued songwriting and composition at local private music high school Hitmaker Global Academy while in JC. She then relocated to Melbourne, Australia, in February 2024 when Monash University offered her a place in its three-year Bachelor of Music (composition and music technology) programme. After a year at Monash, the opportunity to be part of a K-pop girl group was too good to pass up. She decided to discontinue her studies and signed a five-year contract with Na Entertainment for a shot at being an idol. But the driven young singer has no plans to give up her music education. She is currently pursuing an online bachelors degree in songwriting and music production from Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, US, and still has about three more years to go. Finding the time to juggle schoolwork with daily K-pop training from noon to 9pm and performances has been challenging, but she is in it for the long haul. Homesickness is another battle, says the only child. She is very close to her 54-year-old mother, who works as a finance professional in the healthcare industry. I miss Singapores food and warm weather. I fall sick easily when it gets cold, Nicole says. Thankfully, my mum visits often, and we always talk over the phone. Having spent a year away from home when she was at Monash also helped prepare her for her current living arrangements. Nicole has started cooking local food, like her favourite chicken rice, for her fellow members. NWH:I have performed on popular South Korean TV music programmes, such as Show Champion and Show! Music Core, and at live events like the 2025 Gimpo Marine Corps Cultural Festival and at various South Korean high schools. Nicole describes NWH:Is music style as Y2K, a playful and youthful aesthetic that blends late 1990s and early 2000s nostalgia, while DNAs concept leans towards stronger, energetic and more mature choreography. She is aware that NWH:I invite comparisons with Katseye, the popular multinational girl group formed through the 2023 reality competition series Dream Academy, a collaboration between South Korean entertainment giant Hybe and US music label Geffen Records. But Nicole stresses that her group are rooted more firmly in South Korea, focusing more on K-pop and South Korean songs, whereas Katseye leans towards an English-language, global-pop direction. Nina is their leader, and while the seven members inevitably have disagreements, they pride themselves on talking things through and resolving issues quickly. Staying together in a three-bedroom dorm in Incheon – Nicoles roommate is Alice – means they see one another at their most tired and most excited. Nicole admits she feels very nervous before performances, but also enjoys the thrill of a live audience as fan energy is intoxicating. NWH:Is fandom name is NEW:S, chosen to reflect the idea of fans being the ones who bring and highlight the groups best moments. Nicole, who is back in town for a short break, is excited to return to work later in January when NWH:I will be releasing a new single. Recognising the extremely competitive industry she is in, where new K-pop groups are launched every few months – such as JYP Entertainments boy band KickFlip, SM Entertainments girl group Hearts2Hearts, BigHits boy band Cortis and Black Labels co-ed group AllDay Project – Nicole remains optimistic. The plan for 2026 and beyond is simple but ambitious: more releases, more performances and, eventually, world tour stops that take NWH:I beyond the studios and music shows where they first cut their teeth. Fully aware that she is considered old in the K-pop industry, Nicole – who can also play the piano – is branching out into writing songs for NWH:I. She is inspired by Korean-American singer-songwriter Ejae, who spent a decade as an SM Entertainment trainee. Though Ejae never debuted as an idol, she remained on the scene and found her place in songwriting. The 34-year-old is now celebrated for writing several hit songs for the animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters (2025), including the chart-topping breakout track Golden. Nicoles biggest dream, however, is to have a homecoming show. She says: I really want to perform in Singapore. Taking the stage at home with my members will be especially meaningful.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/after-sending-one-audition-video-singaporean-nicole-bacon-is-now-in-rookie-k-pop-girl-group-nwhi
"S&P 500 ends lower, AI stocks buoy Nasdaq","Jan 08, 2026, 06:08 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 06:08 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1368af89729e11d0c567ba9c59cd4e9bdfc46c73d5a6c52c7366ee6d269a6aeb,"Traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, in New York City, on Jan 7.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Stocks and shares', 'Dow Jones', 'Nasdaq']","NEW YORK - The S&P 500 ended lower on Jan 7, pulled down by declines in JPMorgan, Blackstone and other financials, while Nvidia and Alphabet lifted the Nasdaq as investors shifted toward AI-related stocks. Drops in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average followed intraday record highs earlier in the session. Shares of housing acquisition companies tumbled after President Donald Trump said he was moving to ban Wall Street investors from buying single-family homes, in a bid to reduce home prices. Blackstone and Apollo Global Management dropped more than 5 per cent, contributing to a 1.4 per cent decline in the S&P 500 financials index. American Homes 4 Rent fell 4.3 per cent. Real estate platform Zillow moved over 2 per cent higher. JPMorgan Chase fell 2.3 per cent after Wolfe Research downgraded the bank to peer perform from outperform. Northrop Grumman slid 5.5 per cent and Lockheed Martin lost 4.8 per cent after Mr Trump said he would not permit dividends or stock buybacks for defence companies until they fix problems with the production of military equipment. In his social media post, Mr Trump did not mention specific companies. Nvidia and Microsoft rose about 1 per cent each, and Alphabet rose more than 2 per cent as investors shifted back into AI stocks following recent worries they were overvalued. Underscoring investor appetite for heavyweight AI players, Anthropic is planning a multibillion-dollar fundraise that would value the Claude chatbot maker at US$350 billion (S$450 billion). That would make the privately held company more valuable than the vast majority of corporations, including Advanced Micro Devices, Chevron and Wells Fargo. Investors have come into 2026 with a similar playbook to last year: Buy tech and forget about it. Rumours that the AI trade was done turned out not to be true, said Mr Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Heading into fourth-quarter earnings season in the next few weeks, valuations on Wall Street remain relatively pricey. The S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, down from 23 in November, but above the indexs five-year average of 19, according to LSEG data. The S&P 500 declined 0.34 per cent to end the session at 6,920.93 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.16 per cent to 23,584.28 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.94 per cent to 48,996.08 points. Data on Jan 7 showed US job openings fell more than expected in November after rising marginally in October, while a separate ADP report showed that private payrolls increased less than expected in December. While the latest labour market datasets mark a return to the standard release of economic data disrupted by the US government shutdown, they did little to change expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve ahead of a key government payrolls report on Jan 9. Investors were also monitoring geopolitical developments after the US said it seized a Russian-flagged, Venezuela-linked tanker as part of Mr Trumps aggressive push to dictate oil flows in the Americas and force Caracas socialist government to become its ally. The White House said on Jan 6 that Mr Trump was discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the US military. Memory and storage technology companies gave up some of their steep gains following a recent rally. Western Digital dropped almost 9 per cent and Seagate Technology fell 6.7 per cent. First Solar tumbled 10 per cent after Jefferies downgraded the solar panel makers rating to hold from buy. Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 by a 3.4-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 28 new highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 106 new highs and 58 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was relatively heavy, with 17.4 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 16.2 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

In a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump said he was immediately taking steps to implement the ban which he would also call on Congress to codify in law. For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream, Mr Trump wrote, going on to add that inflation had put that dream out of reach for many Americans. People live in homes, not corporations, said Mr Trump, who is under growing pressure to address voter anxiety over the cost of living ahead of this years congressional mid-term elections. A Republican move to target Wall Street landlords would, perversely, align the party with Democrats, who for years have criticised corporate homebuying, claiming it has helped stoke housing costs, and have unsuccessfully pushed Bills to crackdown on the trend. Wall Street institutions such as Blackstone, American Homes 4 Rent and Progress Residential have bought thousands of single-family homes since the financial crisis of 2008 led to a wave of home foreclosures. By June 2022, institutional investors owned around 450,000 homes, or about 3 per cent, of all single-family rental homes nationally, according to a 2024 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). American Homes 4 Rent dropped to a near three-year low of US$28.84 and was halted for volatility before trading resumed. Its shares were last down nearly 6 per cent at US$30.61. Blackstone shares hit a one-month low of US$147.52 and were last down about 4.5 per cent at US$155.33. The PHLX housing index was down 2.3 per cent on the session, on track for its biggest daily percentage drop since Nov 17. Blackstone, American Homes 4 Rent and Progress Residential did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wall Street landlords dispute that their investments have stoked inflation. In a January 2025 research note, Blackstone said institutional home purchases have declined 90 per cent since 2022 and that supply shortage is the reason for house price increases. The GAO study found that the effect of institutional homebuying on homeownership opportunities was unclear in part due to limited data. Critics say Wall Street firms are also bad landlords, skimping on upkeep in order to keep investors happy, and wrongly evicted tenants during the Covid-19 pandemic. Resident experience is hurting as a result, said Mr Jeff Holzmann, chief operating officer of RREAF Holdings, a Dallas-based real estate investment firm with over US$5 billion (S$6.4 billion) in assets. Instead of you calling your landlord to discuss a problem, youre calling a call centre that gives you the runaround. Mr Trump, who has occasionally dismissed affordability concerns and blamed inflation on his Democratic predecessor, has seen his own public approval mostly sag since his inauguration as Americans worry about the economy. It was not immediately clear what authority Mr Trump would draw upon to impose an immediate ban, and he did not outline the changes he was seeking from Congress. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The US president was due to sign unspecified executive orders later on Jan 7. Since Mr Trumps first electoral victory, US home prices have risen 75 per cent, more than double the increase in overall consumer prices tracked by CPI. But home sales price increases have eased substantially over the past year. The Federal Housing Finance Agency last week reported that national home sales prices had risen just 1.7 per cent in October from a year earlier - the lowest in more than 13 years. Thats less than half the rate by which they were climbing when Mr Trump came back into office last January and a fraction of their peak gains of nearly 20 per cent in 2021 and 2022. A big factor in home price inflation has been a dearth of supply of properties for sale, although that has also been slowly improving in the last year or so, according to National Association of Realtors data. As of November, annual shelter-cost inflation, which had shot to as high as 8.2 per cent in the Covid-19 pandemic aftermath, had also eased to 3 per cent, the lowest in more than four years, according to the Labour Departments Consumer Price Index.

We have engaged the worlds leading commodity marketers and key banks to execute and provide financial support for these crude oil and crude products sales, the Energy Department said in a fact sheet on Jan 7. The decision follows the Trump administrations announcement that it plans to control Venezuelas future oil sales and manage the proceeds after the removal of former president Nicolas Maduro. President Donald Trump is pushing for US oil companies such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil to rebuild Venezuelas infrastructure and revive production in the beleaguered nation, a significant undertaking estimated to cost US$10 billion (S$12.8 billion) a year over the next decade. As part of the effort, the Energy Department said it would selectively roll back sanctions to enable the transport and sale of Venezuelan crude and oil products to global markets. The changes would also allow the import of select oil field equipment, parts and services. Venezuelas state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, said in a statement that it is in negotiations with Washington over crude sales through a framework that would be similar to its arrangement with Chevron, the only US oil major still operating in the country.

From shipbuilder to offshore wind giant: How Spore firms early shift to renewables helped it pivot and scale up,"Jan 08, 2026, 04:00 AM",,https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/312af8878e0a7adbd565ba0c439132f039fb9e36e97388baab3ac8ddad116853,"By leveraging digital innovations such as smart sensors and artificial intelligence, engineering firm Seatrium is linking its 13 yards and facilities around the world to take on complex energy projects.PHOTO: SEATRIUM","['Renewable energy', 'Branded content', 'Enterprise Singapore']","Maintenance work at a shipyard used to be time-consuming and physically demanding. Mr Chris Ong, chief executive officer of home-grown offshore and energy solutions firm Seatrium, says: Next to our office in Tuas is a tall 700-tonne gantry crane. To do regular maintenance, our colleagues had to climb all the way up there and then start going through each component to check for downtime. A gantry crane can be as tall as 90m – the height of a 25-storey building – and workers were exposed to the blazing sun as they carried out their checks. Today, the Seatrium maintenance team has it better, thanks to its Yard of the Future initiative, a digital transformation push supported by Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG). By fitting cranes and heavy equipment with sensors, and developing digital twins of its global yards, Seatrium has created a real-time simulation of how its operations run. Engineers now monitor a single dashboard, are able to spot anomalies before they become major problems, and can plan work more efficiently. Only when they see abnormalities, like excessive vibration in the gantry, will they make that trip up there, says Mr Ong. Seatrium was established in 2023 with the merger of Keppel Offshore & Marine and Sembcorp Marine, two Singapore marine giants. The new company has grown far beyond its shipyard roots to become a global engineering solutions provider, serving both traditional energy and fast-growing renewables. That means building everything from oil production platforms to the offshore substations that transmit power from offshore wind farms to the onshore grid. Mr Ong has witnessed this evolution first-hand. Now in his 26th year with the company – his first job was with Keppel Offshore & Marine after university – he has seen the transformation from traditional shipbuilding into a major energy player. Today, he is overseeing the companys global initiative to build the Yard of the Future with the support of EnterpriseSG. For decades, Seatrium employees had to coordinate work at its shipyards in a manual way. Mr Ong says: You had to call your counterpart in another country to ask about their yards and their occupation period. We had to do that with many different facilities before we could start work. With the Yard of the Future, those days will become a thing of the past. The initiative is a multi-year effort to digitalise operations and harmonise data across 13 yards worldwide, including in Brazil, China and Indonesia. To assist Seatrium in digitalisation, EnterpriseSG provided grants and connected it to technology providers. From there, the company deployed 5G connectivity, digital control towers, machine learning and augmented reality-assisted remote inspections and AI-enabled digital workflows. These innovations cut on-site manhours by up to 30 per cent and improve engineers efficiency by up to 20 per cent. This digital system is what Mr Ong describes as the companys secret sauce. It drives what he calls the One Seatrium Global Delivery Model – an approach where large projects can be broken down into smaller pieces, get assigned to the most suitable yard in its global network, and all the pieces are put together during integration at its Singapore yard. For example, one yard might be better at welding steel structures, while another excels at electrical systems. By matching tasks to each facilitys strengths, the company can take on projects that would normally require a single massive shipyard. According to Mr Ong, this model allows Seatrium to compete effectively against marine companies that have much bigger facilities. This distributed approach came from dealing with Singapores practical challenges. The world right now requires energy products of different complexity and sizes, says Mr Ong. How do we compete when land, labour and cost is an issue in Singapore? Thats how we came up with the One Seatrium Global Delivery Model. With this new way of working and the digital smart yard system, clients around the world can now track projects in real time. Seatriums operations have also become greener, thanks to predictive maintenance and condition monitoring. This creates an edge when bidding for global contracts, especially as more clients prioritise sustainability. Offshore wind, in particular, has become a cornerstone of Seatriums shift to cleaner energy. The company was an early player in renewables, having built its first offshore substation in the UK in 2009. To help Seatrium become a major player in the energy transition, EnterpriseSG has facilitated connections with project developers, supply chain players and government counterparts in multiple countries, including the UK, Poland, South Korea and Australia. Since then, the company has delivered key infrastructure for offshore wind farms in Europe, including the Dudgeon and Hornsea 2 projects, as well as a 1.4 GW offshore converter platform for the Sofia Offshore Wind Farm – all located in the North Sea. Once fully operational, the Sofia platform will deliver clean energy to power approximately 1.2 million homes across the UK. Building on its work in offshore wind infrastructure, the company secured the BalWin 5 offshore grid connection project in Germany in December 2025 as part of a consortium with GE Vernova, a global energy technology company. The project will help bring electricity generated by offshore wind farms in the North Sea onto Germanys power grid, supplying enough renewable energy for about 2.75 million households. Seatrium has delivered or is in progress of delivering 16 GW of offshore wind products. This is more than the installed base of Singapores (power grid), says Mr Ong. EnterpriseSG has also given Seatrium a platform on the world stage. In June 2024, the agency led a Singapore delegation to theGlobal Offshore Wind trade showin Manchester, positioning Seatrium alongside other industry players as part of Singapores renewable energy capabilities, and providing exposure to international clients and partners. Seatrium is actively pursuing over $11 billion in pipeline opportunities for offshore wind related contracts, underscoring its ability to compete at the highest level. The companys position in offshore wind builds on experience from its predecessor firms, Keppel Offshore & Marine and Sembcorp Marine, which began building such infrastructure as early as 2008. In 2024, the company recorded $2.1 billion in revenue from renewables and cleaner energy solutions. This is a 15 per cent increase from 2023s baseline. Renewables and cleaner energy solutions now account for approximately 30 per cent of the companys order book as of Sept 30, 2025. Building projects on this scale means Seatrium needs more than its own facilities. It works with various home-grown companies that supply steel, fabricate components and provide specialised services – giving these smaller firms access to large-scale international projects. Mr Ong says: Many times, we have to behave like a queen bee. When we go overseas, we not only have to convince customers of Seatriums ability to deliver; we have to convince them of our whole ecosystem. Working with EnterpriseSG, the company helps these firms upgrade, meet international standards and navigate foreign regulations. We cant do it on our own, adds Mr Ong. When we put Seatrium, our small and medium-sized enterprises and EnterpriseSG together, then the answer is very clear – this is an efficient way of bringing our Singapore ecosystem out there to the world. The partnership has shaped how Seatrium competes globally, from digitalising across its 13 yards to securing major renewable energy contracts to bringing local suppliers into overseas markets. With EnterpriseSG by our side, we are building not just rigs and platforms, we are building the future of Singapores energy industry.

Spore interest rates could bottom out in second quarter of 2026: UOB,"Jan 07, 2026, 08:36 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 10:08 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/19d994116ceb00acb9e6de4df6f74f8486e6579d35fc273828cb587585c5afb1,UOB is expecting US interest rates to bottom out in the third quarter of 2026 and Singapore interest rates to bottom out in the second quarter.PHOTO: ST FILE,"['Banks and financial institutions', 'Interest rates', 'UOB', 'Singapore economy']","SINGAPORE - Interest rates in Singapore could bottom out in the second quarter of 2026 as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates, shortening the wait for hedging opportunities. The Singapore Overnight Rate Average, or Sora, is the Republics key interest rate benchmark and reflects the average rate of unsecured overnight interbank Singdollar borrowing. For consumers, it influences how much interest they pay on home loans and other bank borrowings. If you are looking to hedge interest rates, the timeframe to be looking at it is the first and second quarter of 2026. We are not so far away from the low, said UOB senior foreign exchange strategist Peter Chia. Speaking at UOBs 2026 market outlook webinar on Jan 7, Mr Chia noted that Sora could bottom around 1 per cent before heading towards 1.39 per cent by the end of 2026. He added that Singapore interest rates were already showing signs of stabilising in late 2025 after the Fed cut rates in the US in September, Octoberand December. This is consistent with our view that a lot of the transmission of Fed rate cuts to Singapore happened before the rate cuts, not after, he said. As Singapore rates have moved lower ahead of the Feds rate cuts, we expect the former to bottom ahead of the latter. UOB is expecting US interest rates to bottom out in the third quarter of 2026 and Singapore interest rates to bottom out in the second quarter. Sora is expected to stabilise at a time when growth in the Singapore economy is also forecast to moderate after a strong year in 2025. The local economyexpanded 4.8 per cent in 2025– topping the Governments forecast of 4 per cent. In 2026, gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 2.6 per cent, according to UOBs latest forecasts. This is up from 2.1 per cent previously. UOB head of research Suan Teck Kin said: We had a very strong year in 2025. I doubt we are going to be able to replicate the same momentum that we had last year. He noted that 2025 was an unusually strong year, lifted by factors including booming demand for AI chips and companies shipping goods earlier than usual, especially pharmaceuticals. Mr Suan added that a 2.6 per cent growth rate is still a decent number and quite close to a potential growth rate of about 3 per cent. The Government forecasts GDP growth for 2026to be in the range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent. UOB is projecting two Fed rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2026, particularly in the second and third quarter, but cautioned that there is a lot of uncertainty, depending on what the new US Fed chairman decides to do. Mr Jerome Powells term as Fed chairman is set to end in May. The Fed cut rates three times in 2025 to a range of 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent while projecting one more cut for 2026 because of labour market concerns and ongoing inflation.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/spore-interest-rates-could-bottom-out-in-second-quarter-of-2026-uob

"AI trust mark, master trainers to help business leaders top KPMG and SIDs Budget 2026 wish list","Jan 07, 2026, 05:22 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 05:38 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b91a7175507d12aff6700dfbf6e3c7fb29ea614944033841be1cd486d1d80301,The Budget 2026 recommendations laid out by KPMG and SID focus on strengthening Singapores resilience and competitiveness in an uncertain global landscape.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI,"['Budget 2026', 'Budget', 'Singapore economy', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'Trade']","SINGAPORE - A form of trust and assurance certification for artificial intelligence (AI) could be critical to reinforcing Singapores credibility in the regions AI space. The Republic will also have to raise its global competitiveness not just by hastening AI adoption among companies, but also by readying a new generation of professionals and board leaders with specialised talents and skill sets to help businesses navigate an increasingly complex world. One way is the creation of a new work-pass category for global master trainers and mentors to conduct leadership development programmes here. These are some of the Budget 2026 recommendations that professional services firm KPMG and the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) put out in a report released on Jan 7, ahead ofPrime Minister Lawrence Wongs Budgetspeechon Feb 12. Singapore will need to ensure its businesses and economy remain secure, innovative and competitive in an uncertain global landscape, the two organisations said in their Budget wish list. This would involve embedding digital trust; cultivating world-class talent and leadership with cross-domain expertise; and building resilient economic linkages. The recommendations by KPMG and SID include the establishment of platforms, programmes and grants to address these critical areas, based on observations made by 1,000 business owners and professionals surveyed. Mr Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, partner and head of tax at KPMG in Singapore, said Budget 2026, as the first Budget after the 2025 General Election, presents a timely opportunity to address the challenges of a fragmented global economy and rising trade uncertainties. We believe that our recommendations are designed to help Singapore not only adapt to global shifts, but also reinforce its role as a trusted hub for global flows. In the area of digital transformation, the report said Singapore could become a regional AI leader by championing a Trusted AI mark, similar to aGreen Mark sustainability certification. This trust mark would serve as a platform for mutual recognition, enabling alignment on ethical standards, data governance policies and assurance tools across the region. It would allow companies to deploy AI solutions across ASEAN without duplicative compliance, thus accelerating cross-border innovation and trade. By taking the lead on developing this framework for ASEAN, Singapore could reinforce its leadership in a multipolar world and deepen its role in regional ecosystems, the report said. It also noted that companies still face challenges in adopting AI due to high costs and lack of talent and skills, and thus called for additional grants and enhancements to the public-private partnership framework to accelerate AI adoption among companies. This could foster cross-sector collaboration in key industries such as finance, advanced manufacturing and logistics, allowing firms to benefit from tailored AI solutions and partnerships that drive open innovation ecosystems. Mr Sanganeria added that while Singapore could not compete with other countries in the development of AI models and infrastructure, there is a huge opportunity for it to take a lead position in facilitating AI adoption in Singapore and beyond. Upskilling professionals to ready them as the next generation of business leaders was also a key priority laid out by KPMG and SID. Their report cited a need for professionals and board leaders with expertise in areas such as supply chain management, AI governance and sustainability strategy. Some 37 per cent of survey respondents indicated that they wanted more leadership and management development initiatives, especially in the areas of mentorship and coaching for emerging leaders and advanced leadership programmes. This skill gap could be addressed with structured upskilling and leadership development programmes led by professional international master trainers and mentors, who could join local companies, public agencies and training institutions under a new work-pass category. These master trainers would have proven expertise in leadership, innovation and workforce development, the report said. Exposing workers to global best practices would accelerate skills transfer and build a robust pipeline of talent – including C-suite leaders – capable of driving strategic transformation and competitiveness in a rapidly evolving global landscape. The report added that these platforms could foster the exchange of best practices, promote collective learning on key sustainability initiatives, and empower leaders to proactively design roles and workflows ahead of market shifts. It also recommended establishing job transformation road maps with co-funded training and certification initiatives to further enhance worker upskilling. While upskilling initiatives like SkillsFuture already exist, the speed of disruption by AI would vary across sectors, raising the need for new initiatives, it said. In addition, KPMG and SID advised setting up a $100 million fund to advance social impact reporting. This funds quantum was estimated based on the $50 million SG Eco Fund launched in November 2020 by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment. It could be used to train professionals and board directors in the reporting of social metrics, support academic modules in social sustainability, and certify social auditors and advisers. KPMG and SID said these efforts are especially important as they address social sustainability, which is a more nascent space than environmental sustainability. This could strengthen interest from socially conscious global investors and secure sustained investments for future growth, they added. Sustainability is a big topic, and you do not have to be experts at it, but you need to know enough to be able to drive action, SIDs vice-chair Max Loh told The Straits Times. He acknowledged that small and medium-sized enterprises would face different challenges compared with larger, more established firms in upskilling their employees. But the key would be to ensure continual learning and improvement across all, so that ideas for change and transformation can go beyond the theoretical and be applied in the practical world. You can have management that is very well informed, but directors are the ones that govern, lead and inspire. They can always bring in experts to guide, but at the end of the day, the board still needs to have a certain thought process and support companies in their goals. On strengthening economic resilience, KPMG and SID recommended the development of a unified digital platform for the management of free trade agreements to overcome potential trade barriers in an increasingly uncertain world. Seamlessly integrated with government systems, this would help businesses navigate complex procedures such as determining the origin country for goods and services, and reduce compliance costs. Given the current pace of change and complexity, we are seeing businesses pivoting or adapting their supply chain more often than in the past. So having such a platform would allow businesses to respond more quickly, said Ms Lee Sze Yeng, managing partner of KPMG in Singapore. Singapore could introduce a specific grant to help businesses streamline processes and subsidise workforce training to complement this platform, KPMG and SID added. Other recommendations include a progressive carbon tax system and an ASEAN exchange for environmental data, as well as increasing access to working capital and enhancing the government-backed trade platform with blockchain and AI.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/ai-trust-mark-master-trainers-to-help-business-leaders-top-kpmg-and-sids-budget-2026-wish-list
Wealthy clients stocking up on Singapore stocks to hedge against falling US dollar: Bank of Spore,"Jan 07, 2026, 02:38 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 03:38 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/efb78b9bda054d42383cad31a4ea72ddaca0940444ad88b45907116814af2e85,"Bank of Singapore said its clients have generally not rotated out of US dollar assets, but have added Singdollar exposure alongside existing US holdings.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Banks and financial institutions', 'Singapore stocks', 'US dollar', 'Singapore dollar', 'The Business Times']","SINGAPORE - Allocations to Singapore dollar assets through discretionary mandates at Bank of Singapore doubled year on year in 2025, as wealthy investors and family offices sought to hedge against US dollar exposure amid weakness in the greenback. The surge marked a sharp acceleration from the typical pace of growth in Singapore-focused allocations, which is usually in the single digits. The private banking arm of OCBC Bank said on Jan 7 that assets under management (AUM) in its Singapore-focused discretionary portfolio management (DPM) mandates also grew faster than its overall DPM asset base, which expanded by nearly 20 per cent over the year. These mandates typically allocate between 40 per cent and 95 per cent to Singapore stocks, with the remainder invested in Singapore dollar-denominated bonds and cash. Under the DPM structure, clients delegate day-to-day investment decisions to the bank, which manages portfolios in line with an agreed mandate and risk profile. This contrasts with traditional advisory arrangements, where relationship managers propose investment ideas but clients retain final decision-making authority on each trade. In the past two years, Bank of Singapore has observed rising interest among clients – particularly those from China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore – in diversifying away from US dollar exposure, global chief investment officer Jean Chia told The Business Times. Youve seen the US dollar coming down 9 per cent to 10 per cent (in that period) – just doing nothing, you already see a depreciation in your portfolio, said Ms Chia. That has prompted more clients to explore avenues of how they can mitigate this risk, and provide a hedge for their overall portfolio. The Singdollar is one of the candidates. Over the past year, the US dollar has fallen more than 6 per cent against the Singdollar. Even so, clients have generally not rotated out of US dollar assets to fund their Singapore investments, Ms Chia noted, but have added Singdollar exposure alongside existing US holdings. I wont say that its zero sum, like, Oh, Im out of US dollars. No, not at all, she added. Ill say its more complementary. Beyond fresh inflows, growth in discretionary AUM was also supported by equity market performance. Singapore-focused mandates delivered double-digit returns in 2025, with one mandate achieving annualised returns of 12 per cent over the past five years, outperforming the MSCI Singapore Index. With dividend yields of around 4 per cent to 5 per cent, the Singapore market also offers attractive income for investors seeking stability and sustainable long-term returns in a low-interest rate environment, the private bank said. It added: Furthermore, with property cooling measures limiting foreign ownership of residential real estate, Singapore equities present a compelling alternative for investors holding Singapore dollars.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/wealthy-clients-stocking-up-on-singapore-stocks-to-hedge-against-falling-us-dollar-bos

The guidelines take effect in February and follow a series of notices from Beijing warning Alibaba and rivals, including Meituan and JD.com, against pressuring merchants into discounts and other measures accused of disrupting market order. A separate set of regulations, also published by the State Administration for Market Regulation and Cyberspace Administration of China, also bar online influencers from making false claims. Alibabas shares slid as much as 4.2 per cent in Hong Kong, leading losses in peers such as AI video platform Kuaishou, JD and Meituan. Beijing has since 2025 heightened scrutiny of the countrys vast retail arena, particularly after Alibaba, JD and Meituan began spending billions of dollars on subsidies and incentives to try to dominate the meal delivery sector. Its watchdogs have over the past year singled out practices such as no-questions-asked refunds and exclusivity arrangements that they say hurt smaller merchants. China already has an e-commerce law to govern the sector. Some of the new regulations are designed to specifically target misbehaviour of platforms, the online tech companies that connect buyers with sellers. The new rules also require them to protect consumers and user data. Violations could lead to warnings and fines. Rampant discounting and subsidies have also eroded margins across the e-commerce industry. In November, Meituan blamed irrational competition for its first loss in almost three years, reflecting the toll of its three-way battle with Alibaba and JD in a weak Chinese consumer environment.

Inter moved to 42 points, four ahead of both AC Milan, who host Genoa on Thursday, and Napoli who were held to a 2-2 draw by Hellas Verona earlier on Wednesday. Parma are 15th in the standings on 18 points. Parma were pinned back into their own half from the off as Inter created early chances, with Francesco Pio Espositos header failing to trouble Parma keeper Edoardo Corvi. Yann Bisseck fired a powerful shot from outside the area which Corvi tipped onto the crossbar and Lautaro Martinez headed over from close range as Inter piled on the pressure. A rare Parma attack ended with Jacob Ondrejka hitting a volley off the post, a warning to Inter who went up the other end and Espositos shot clipped the bar but the visitors took the lead three minutes before the break. Dimarco played a pass into Esposito in the box and the under-pressure forward laid the ball back to Dimarco who drove his shot in off the upright from a tight angle. Parma proved better at stifling Inters attacking threat in the second half, although Petar Sucic had an excellent chance to double the lead. Sucic did well to beat the offside trap and get on the end of Hakan Calhanoglus pass but with just the keeper to beat he blasted wide and was hauled off minutes later by Inters frustrated manager Cristian Chivu. Chivu guided Parma to Serie A safety last season after taking over with 13 games remaining in his first senior managerial role, but this season the Romanian has his sights set on a much bigger prize. His Inter side will head into Sundays clash at the San Siro with Napoli with a four-point cushion over the champions. Ange-Yoan Bonny had a goal disallowed in added time for a handball in the build-up but Thuram netted the second Inter goal after going through one-on-one with the keeper.

Erling Haaland scored his 150th goal for City as he put them in front against Brighton and Hove Albion from the penalty spot but Kaoru Mitoma equalised for the visitors on the hour with the game finishing 1-1. It was the third successive draw for stuttering City who were held by Sunderland on New Years Day and by Chelsea at the weekend when they also conceded an equaliser. Second-placed City remain five points behind Arsenal who can stretch the lead to eight if they beat Liverpool on Thursday. Third-placed Villa are also five behind after they could only draw 0-0 in a dour contest at Crystal Palace, Ollie Watkins going closest for Villa with a late effort against the woodwork. Chelseas new manager Liam Rosenior watched on in the stands at Craven Cottage as his new club went down 2-1 at Fulham after having Marc Cucurella sent off midway through the first half. Raul Jimenez gave Fulham the lead and although Liam Delap equalised for the visitors, Harry Wilson sealed the points for Fulham. Defeat left Chelsea down in eighth place. Two days after sacking manager Ruben Amorim, Manchester United could only draw 2-2 at 19th-placed Burnley. Benjamin Sesko scored twice for United, doubling his tally for the season, but it was not enough to give caretaker manager Darren Fletcher a win as Jaidon Anthonys equaliser earned Burnley a point. United slipped to seventh. Brentford moved into fifth spot as Brazilian striker Igor Thiago followed up his hat-trick at the weekend against Everton with two goals in a 3-0 home victory over Sunderland to take his league tally for the season to 16. Newcastle United trailed three times in a thriller at home to Leeds United but emerged with an astonishing 4-3 victory to move into the top six thanks to a last-gasp goal by Harvey Barnes after Bruno Guimaraes had equalised for the hosts from the penalty spot in the 91st minute. Barness goal arrived in the 102nd minute, the latest winning goal in Premier League history. Bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers recent upturn continued with a 1-1 draw at Everton. Everton ended the game with nine men after Michael Keane, who scored their goal, and Jack Grealish were both sent off late on -- Keane for an apparent hair pull on Tolu Arokodare. Antoine Semenyo gave Bournemouth fans a likely farewell gift before his expected move to Manchester City, scoring in stoppage time to give his side a 3-2 victory at home against Tottenham Hotspur, his sides first win in 12 league games. Semenyo illustrated just why City are prepared to pay 65 million pounds ($87.46 million) for his services with a curling shot past Guglielmo Vicario sparking wild celebrations as Bournemouth ended an 11-match winless run. City produced a lacklustre display against Brighton but Haalands penalty, after a foul by Diego Gomez on Jeremy Doku, looked like earning them a victory that would have put some pressure on leaders Arsenal. Brighton struck back though as Mitoma guided in an equaliser from the edge of the penalty area. Haaland should have won it for City late on but fired a shot straight at Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen.

Haaland struck his 150th goal for City from the penalty spot four minutes before the break, after Jeremy Doku was fouled by Diego Gomez and a VAR review confirmed the decision. The Norwegian looked relieved to end a three-match goal drought and take his tally to 20 Premier League goals for the season. City went close to doubling the lead just after the break when Bernardo Silva pounced on a Brighton error, but his effort struck the post. City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and Brightons Maxim De Cuyper became involved in a heated confrontation, which ended with yellow cards for both players. Brighton struck back on the hour mark, as Mitoma met a pass from the flank and positioned himself at the edge of the box before guiding a low shot into the far corner. The visitors took control after the equaliser, slowing the tempo as they built their attacks, and came agonisingly close to going ahead. Mitoma found Gomez inside the box, but Gomez could not get his finish right and struck the goalkeeper. The rebound fell to Mitoma, whose angled shot from near the byline rattled the post. In the dying minutes, Haaland found himself alone in the box with only the goalkeeper to beat, but Bart Verbruggen produced a fine save to deny him.

In a departure from traditional team-controlled facilities, SailGP will centrally manage scheduling to ensure fair, consistent and transparent access throughout the season for all competing teams. Todays news marks an exciting next chapter for SailGP and our competing teams, said SailGP CEO and co-founder Russell Coutts. With access to world-class training facilities, all our athletes can continue to develop year-round – strengthening competition and helping us attract and retain the very best in the sport. Pensacola was chosen for its reliable sailing conditions and advanced infrastructure, allowing teams to test, train and innovate outside race weekends as the championship expands globally. Teams will operate under identical standards and pay only for days used in a structure designed to maintain sporting fairness. American Magic co-founder Doug DeVos said the centre supports a long-term vision to make the U.S. a destination for elite sailing preparation across youth, womens, Olympic and SailGP programmes. The announcement came ahead of next weekends 2026 season opener in Perth, Australia, following Britains dramatic first championship victory over Australia and New Zealand in Abu Dhabi last year.

Villa frustrated in stalemate at Crystal Palace,"Jan 08, 2026, 05:46 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 05:46 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fed12f373263eee1a4280cebdc30a23b79604fc471727acc8016bc4b2447e946,"Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace v Aston Villa - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - January 7, 2026 Aston Villas Victor Lindelof in action with Crystal Palaces Brennan Johnson REUTERS/Ian Walton",[],"LONDON, Jan 7 - Aston Villas Premier League title hopes suffered a blow as they were held to a scoreless draw at Crystal Palace in a high-octane Premier League clash on Wednesday that produced plenty of entertainment, but no goals. With Arsenal topping the standings on 48 points, Villa are in third place on 43, behind Manchester City following their home draw with Brighton & Hove Albion on goal difference. Palace are 13th on 28 points. Brennan Johnson, a recent arrival from Tottenham Hotspur, set the tone with an energetic display for the home side, but his luck deserted him in the penalty box and he must wait for a first goal in the Palace colours. Johnson made his presence felt early on, latching onto a ball played in behind the defence by Adam Wharton in the 17th minute, but Villa keeper Emi Martinez got a touch on Johnsons left-foot shot to push it away for a corner. As the action rolled from one end of the field to another, in-form Villa striker Ollie Watkins found himself on the receiving end of a similar pass, but Palace keeper Dean Henderson came off his line quickly to block the England strikers shot. Johnson went close again for the hosts in the 59th minute and, desperate to make an impact on the game, he was booked shortly afterwards for diving in the box following an innocuous challenge from Villa defender Victor Lindelof. The visitors had to replace keeper Martinez at the break and substitute Marco Bizot was given plenty to do, but the best chance fell to Lindelof, who sent a bouncing header onto the far post late in the game. Villa forced a succession of corners but could not make the breakthrough, with their manager Unai Emery visibly irritated at the final whistle as his side missed a golden opportunity to move second in the table.

Rosenior will take over a team that dropped to seventh from fifth with the defeat after registering only one win in their last nine games. The former Strasbourg manager will also need to improve discipline after Marc Cucurellas 22nd-minute red card for hauling down Wilson - Chelseas eighth of the season in all competitions, including one for former boss Enzo Maresca. The bustling Wilson proved Chelseas undoing. He had already had a first-half goal ruled out by VAR for an offside in the buildup and he scored after Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez had blocked a shot as Fulham piled on the pressure against the tiring visitors. Chelsea had equalised through Liam Delap in the 72nd after Fulhams 55th-minute opener - a diving header from Raul Jimenez. Chelsea might have squeezed a point from the game but Delap and Moises Caicedo had good chances saved by Bernd Leno in the Fulham goal. Chelseas travelling fans made their opposition to the clubs American owners clear in chants throughout the defeat. Maresca departed on New Years Day after falling out with the owners BlueCo who also run Strasbourg. It was a difficult loss for interim coach Calum McFarlane against their less prestigious neighbours just 2.2 km across the borough in southwest London. McFarlane will return to the under-21 team at Chelsea with a draw against Manchester City and Wednesdays defeat to his name.

Raphinha scored twice while Ferran Torres and Roony Bardghji were also on target in a dominant display as Barcelona led 4-0 at halftime and now await the winner of Thursdays second semi-final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, also to be played in Jeddah. Barcelona were ahead in the 22nd minute through Torres, taking an awkward pass that appeared to be a shot gone wrong from Fermin, and his fine first touch allowed him to fire into the back of the net from seven yards. It was 2-0 on the half-hour mark when Raphinha reached the byline and his low cross to the middle of the penalty box was brilliantly turned into the net by Fermin. Fermin then made it a hat-trick of goal contributions when he turned provider again for Bardghji on 34 minutes, though it was a simple pass into the latter, who twisted and turned in the box before firing low into the net. Barcelona were rampant at this stage and they added a fourth through Raphinha when he burst into the box and blasted into the roof of the net. The Brazilian netted his second on 52 minutes as Bilbao failed to clear a ball into the penalty area, and Raphinha fired home a left-footed shot. Barcelona are looking to defend the Super Cup title they won last season, extending their record number of victories in the competition to 15. The final will be played on Sunday in Jeddah.

The 38-year-old Argentina legend, who is signed with Miami through 2028, said he prefers ownership over coaching as his second act. I dont see myself as a coach, the two-time MLS MVP and eight-time Ballon dOr winner told Argentine streaming channel Luzu TV, in an interview published on Jan 6. I want to have my own club, start from the bottom and make it big. Being able to give kids the opportunity to develop and achieve something important. If I had to choose, that would appeal to me more. Messi, who guided Inter Miami to their first MLS Cup championship in 2025, has a future minority ownership stake in the MLS club in his contract. In May, he helped longtime former MLS and FC Barcelona teammate Luis Suarez to launch a new fourth-division club Deportivo LSM in Suarezs native Uruguay. I want to thank Luis for giving me this opportunity, for inviting me to join him and share this project that he has been working on for many years and that has grown a lot, Messi said at the time, per ESPN Uruguay. Being able to be a part of this is an honour. I hope to contribute everything I can to continue growing this club and to be by your side. Messi and Miami begin the 2026 MLS regular season on Feb 21 at Los Angeles FC.

Napoli fight back to snatch draw at home to struggling Verona,"Jan 08, 2026, 05:01 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 05:01 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/9f2d6c00a2493d1237986dbef4741a1bd1e67cc1349250d3203c51687d20a5c1,"Soccer Football - Serie A - Napoli v Hellas Verona - Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Naples, Italy - January 7, 2026 Napoli coach Antonio Conte and Hellas Verona head coach Paolo Zanetti before the match REUTERS/Ciro De Luca",['Antonio Conte'],"NAPLES, Italy, Jan 7 - Champions Napoli fought back to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to relegation-battling Hellas Verona on Wednesday, denying the visitors their first win in Naples in over 40 years but failing to move top of the Serie A standings. Napoli remained in third spot on 38 points, one point off leaders Inter Milan, who are away to Parma later on Wednesday. Verona stayed third from bottom, the final relegation spot, on 13 points, two points off 17th-placed Genoa. Napoli came into the match on the back of four consecutive wins, including their Super Cup success, without conceding while Verona had lost their last two, both by a 3-0 scoreline but the visitors came close to pulling off a famous win. The hosts were on the attack early and the first chance fell to Eljif Elmas, whose shot was saved by Verona keeper Lorenzo Montipo. Despite dominating possession, that would prove to be Napolis only effort on target in the opening half while Verona made the most of their quick counter-attacking play. Gift Orban tried his luck from distance, his deflected shot easily gathered by Napoli keeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic before the visitors took a shock lead in the 16th minute. Cheikh Niasse played a low pass into the six-yard area and the unmarked Martin Frese scored with a delightful backheel. Things got worse for the hosts when Verona were awarded a penalty for an Alessandro Buongiorno handball. Orban stepped up with boos ringing out around the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona but he kept his cool and buried the spot kick into the bottom corner in the 27th minute. Rasmus Hojlund headed over a Giovanni Di Lorenzo cross as Napoli struggled to find a way back into the game and Verona held firm to take their lead into the break. In the first half we could have done better, even if the episodes went against us, Napoli manager Antonio Conte told DAZN. That could have killed off anyone, but we were good at reacting, having the strength to go and draw the game. Napoli piled forward after the interval, and pulled one back from a corner in the 54th minute. Scott McTominay sent a glancing header goalwards and defender Nicolas Valentinis desperate attempt to head clear ended up in his own net. Verona found their feet again and Antoine Bernede sent a scorching shot over from the edge of the area. Napoli thought they had levelled 18 minutes from time but a VAR check chalked off Hojlunds effort for handball, and an offside call denied Amir Rrahmani. Eight minutes from time, however, Luca Marianucci played a pass into the area which Di Lorenzo met first time to steer his shot past Montipo. Verona, whose last win away to Napoli came in 1983, hung on under extreme pressure but came close to snatching an added-time winner with Giovanes attempted chip going narrowly wide.
