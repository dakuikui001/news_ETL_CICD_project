Creating value proposition crucial for Singaporeans in AI age: Chan Chun Sing,"Jan 09, 2026, 10:12 PM","Jan 09, 2026, 11:39 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/65110316036cd5326c95707755232a49552b71de5cdc8c7a265f3dc9459c643a,Defence Minister Chan Chun Sing at a dialogue titled The Future Of Innovation And Internationalisation – The Role Of Youth In A Changing World – on Jan 9.ST PHOTO: ARIFFIN JAMAR,['Chan Chun Sing'],"SINGAPORE –Creating a value proposition is most important for Singaporeans amid the increasing influence of artificial intelligence (AI), Defence Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Jan 9. This begins with understanding the challenges that people face and the problems they want to solve, said Mr Chan, who was speaking at a dialogue involving 200 guests, mostly students from secondary schools and institutes of higher learning. Now this requires a deep understanding of the environment that we are in, which is why I always encourage all our students, all our young people and not so young people, to constantly look out to the world and understand what the world needs, what the worlds pain points are, he added. Mr Chan stressed that developing solutions requires both a disciplined approach and creativity to create a value proposition that others cannot provide. I dont think we need to despair because there will always be room for the human creativity that is required, he said. The dialogue, titled The Future Of Innovation And Internationalisation – The Role Of Youth In A Changing World, was organised by charitable youth organisation Heartware Network. It featured veteran businessman Yao Hsiao Tung, who is the founder and executive chairman of local advanced manufacturing company Hi-P International. Part of the youth organisations Heartware Leadership Series, the dialogue was held at the SingPost Auditorium in Paya Lebar. During the dialogue, Mr Chan polled the audience on whether they thought that their future jobs will be replaced by AI. Most raised their hands to say no. When asked why, a polytechnic student pursuing a social work course said she was quite confident because her field is highly specialised and requires a human touch. Picking up on this, Mr Chan, who is also Coordinating Minister for Public Services, said that no matter what AI can do for now, there are a few areas where it may never fully replace humans. He cited high touch industries, such as social work, teaching and nursing. You use the tools, whether its AI or any other algorithm, to complement your work, to get rid of all the more mundane work for you to focus more time and attention on the higher value-add work, or the creativity work, he said. Another area is high trust industries, such as business, where a human presence is important for customers to feel confident in their dealings. On the topic of attracting AI-driven companies to invest in Singapore, Mr Chan said the country must have its own value proposition so that jobs can be created for Singaporeans. For that to happen, there are many layers of things that we must do as a society, beyond just having the right skills to attract them here. We must have infrastructure, we must have reliable energy sources, he said. We must have the rules and regulations that facilitate innovation and enterprises and many of these things built the entire ecosystem for us to, first and foremost, compete for the investment to be put in Singapore, for the jobs to be created in Singapore, for fellow Singaporeans to be able to earn our keep. Without such an ecosystem, even Singaporeans with good skills will not be able to find the jobs that they want in Singapore. There are many countries in the world where there are people who are highly educated, but they dont necessarily have the chance to deploy their skills in their own country because the macro environment doesnt allow those investments to be planted (there), he added.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/creating-a-value-proposition-is-crucial-for-singaporeans-in-ai-age-chan-chun-sing
Orchard Road Presbyterian Churchs main building put forth for conservation,"Jan 09, 2026, 10:10 PM","Jan 09, 2026, 11:54 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/8624d9ecc9de41a4221667e27c84a3e58b82f219beab2c812bfbe266e5a00832,Orchard Road Presbyterian Churchs main building (right) has been proposed for conservation.ST PHOTO: BRIAN TEO,"['Conservation/Preservation', 'URA Master Plan', 'Singapore heritage', 'Churches']","SINGAPORE –The 148-year-old main building of Orchard Road Presbyterian Church, which houses the churchs sanctuary, has been put up for conservation. Completed in 1878, it is the oldest building on the churchs site at 3 Orchard Road, which also houses a chapel that dates back to 1953, as well as the Dunman Building, which was built in 1985 and has offices, meeting rooms and classrooms. The proposal to conserve the main building was published by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Jan 9, and comes amid an ongoing project to refresh the churchs compound. In a note accompanying the proposal, URA saidthatthe proposed conservation of the main building recognises the sites longstanding history and architectural significance. If the building is conserved, it cannot be demolished in the future, and future works to it will have to follow guidelines that safeguard its architecturally significant features. Orchard Road Presbyterian Church was founded in 1856 to cater to the Scottish community in Singapore. Its first worship service was held at the London Missionary Societys chapel, located at the junction of North Bridge Road and Bras Basah Road. According to the website of the church – which today sits on a freehold site of about 6,000 sq m in size – it was granted its present site in May 1865. Worship services were moved to the main building after it was completed in November 1878 – a time when the church was known simply as the Presbyterian Church. The main building has been extended several times, including in 1975, and restoration works were last conducted on it in 1985. The churchs spokespersons, Mr Alvin Ooi and Mr Gabriel Tan, said the move to conserve the main building comes as the church celebrates its 170th anniversary in 2026 and as we look towards building on our legacy of faith for future generations. In a statement to The Straits Times, Mr Ooi and Mr Tan, who are both church elders, noted that the building has witnessed many events in Singapores history. These include the Japanese Occupation, Konfrontasi and the development of Orchard Road. They said the main building currently serves about 1,000 worshippers, including those from the churchs English and Indonesian congregations, a Chinese congregation under Providence Presbyterian Church, and the German-Speaking Protestant Congregation in Singapore. Updates on the churchs website state that it moved its worship services to Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre in October 2025, in preparation for the project to refresh its Orchard Road premises. This arrangement is projected to last until November 2027, when the works are completed. Under the project, which is subject to approvals from the authorities, restoration works will be carried out on the main building. A rear slope in the churchs compound will also be strengthened, while the Dunman Building will be redeveloped, with the new five-storey building about 40 per cent larger than the existing one. An extension to the churchs sanctuary named Tomlinson Hall, which was added to the church in 1920 and demolished in 2002, will also be rebuilt. Mr Ooi and Mr Tan said that the works – which are estimated to cost about $42.8 million – will provide modern amenities for the young and old, and be in line with conservation guidelines provided by URA for the main building. Architectural conservator Yeo Kang Shua noted that the building was designed in the neo-classical style, and has features typical of 19th-century Italian neo-renaissance architecture, such as a set of Palladian windows – an arched window flanked by two rectangular windows – below its dome. Having stood since the 1870s, he said, the main building is also historically significant as one of the oldest associated with the Presbyterian denomination in Singapore. To date, Singapore has conserved more than 7,200 buildings and structures in over 100 areas.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/orchard-road-presbyterian-churchs-main-building-put-forth-for-conservation

Some of the best views of the planet are likely to be at Marina Barrage, East Coast Park or the Southern Ridges. The Observatory at Science Centre Singapore said on Jan 9 that this is because of an astronomical event known as Jupiter in opposition. An opposition occurs when a planet appears directly opposite the Sun in the sky, with the Earth positioned between the two. In this case, when the Earth passes directly between Jupiter and the Sun, it causes Jupiter to appear larger and brighter in the night sky than at any other time of the year. The observatory added that the planet will be visible throughout the night of Jan 10. It will begin rising at sunset, and set around sunrise. The phenomenon will be visible across Singapore even to the naked eye as long as skies are clear, the observatory said. To the unaided eye, the planet appears as a bright, steady point of light in the eastern night sky, though its clarity and detail may vary depending on atmospheric conditions and viewing location. Jupiter reaches opposition roughly every 13 months, and the next occurrence is expected around February 2027, the observatory said. It added that it will not hold special viewing sessions for the celestial event. The planet will remain visible over the next few months, and can be observed during weekly stargazing sessions held at the observatory.

The offender kissedthe womanwithout her consent and also asked her if they were meant to have sex. The 36-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victims identity, was sentenced to 11 weeks jail on Jan 9. He had pleaded guilty to one count each of molestation and insulting another persons modesty. An assault charge involvingthe NSF, whom he stomped on the groin and slapped on the forehead, was considered during his sentencing. On Jan 9, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) told The Straits Times that the offender has been suspended from duty. Its spokesperson said: Officers... are expected to uphold the law and maintain the highest standards of conduct and integrity. We deal with officers who break the law severely, including charging them in court. Following the incident, SPF swiftly initiated investigations against the officer, and he was immediately removed from front-line duties... SPF will commence internal action against him. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh told the court that the police officers had attended a dinner and dance eventat a hotel in 2024. The offender drank soju, whisky, vodka and cognac during the event, which ended at around 11pm. The NSF, identified in court documents as A1, then went to a smoking corner near a ballroom and lit a cigarette before the offender joined him there. While sitting down, A1, who had also consumed alcohol, accidentally hit his head on a wall behind a chair and slid to the ground in pain. Seeing this, the offender asked the NSF to sit on the chair properly and added: Officer commands you. After A1 did so, the offender stomped on A1s groin, and started laughing while A1 slid to the ground in pain. Subsequently, he also slapped A1s forehead with his palm, causing A1 to fall to the ground again. His actions were recorded on video by the policewoman, as she wanted to capture evidence of the offender ragging A1. He stopped assaulting A1 when he saw a police commander nearby. Soon after this, the policewoman approached the offender to ask him how he would be going home. He replied that he would follow her, and she agreed to drive him home in her car as they lived near each other. The policewoman then asked another NSF, identified in court as A4, to take the offender to a nearby restroom. While they were there, the offender asked A4 if he wanted to see him make the policewoman pregnant. Shortly after 11.20pm, the offender, the policewoman, A1, A4 and two other NSFs entered a lift to a carpark. The offender then used vulgar language to ask the woman if he was supposed to have sex with her that evening. The woman became scared and replied: No, you just sleep... just close your eyes. As one of the other NSFs went to retrieve the policewomans car, A4 decided to stay with (the policewoman) as he was afraid that the accused might do something inappropriate with her, DPP Teh said. At about 11.25pm, the accused grabbed (her) neck, pulled her face towards his, and kissed her. (She) pushed the accused away... At no point did (she) consent to the actions of the accused. She felt shocked and vulnerable by acts committed by the accused. A4 confronted the offender, but the policewoman asked A4 to calm down as she did not want the situation to escalate. One of the NSFs drove everyone home soon after. Later that night, the offender sent the policewoman a WhatsApp message, asking to meet and claiming that his wife had kicked him out of their home. The policewoman turned him down and lodged a police report after talking to her superiors about the matter. Representing the offender were lawyers Thangavelu – who goes by only one name – and Sugenya Manogaran from Trident Law Corporation. Ms Sugenya pleaded for him to be given five weeks jail, stressing that he had acted out of character that evening. (The man) is a first-time offender with an otherwise exemplary record of public service spanning more than a decade, she added.

The recent figures represent a 74 per cent increase from the 62 incidents reported in the SOMS for 2024, said the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) Information Sharing Centre (ISC) at a media briefing onJan 9. Fortunately, most of the incidents, which had occurred on the eastbound lane of the SOMS, were cases of opportunistic theft that left most of the ships crew uninjured. ReCAAP executive director Vijay D. Chafekar said that theincrease in incidents in 2025 does not indicate a corresponding increase in threat to maritime trade passing through the SOMS. The higher number of incidents largely corresponds to minor petty theft cases, he added. In almost half of the cases, nothing was taken despite the vessels being boarded by unknown persons. Engine spares were stolen in 31 per cent of the incidents. A smaller percentage reported personal belongings, cash and ship stores being stolen. Over half of the incidents happened to bulk carriers or vessels carrying unpacked cargo, mostly in the dead of night. A hint of the spike in sea robbery incidents in the SOMS emerged when the figures for the first half of 2025 were revealed in July 2025. The figure was four times that for the same period in 2024, as there were 80 such incidents reported to ReCAAP between January and June 2025. Yet, the spate of incidents fell from July to October 2025, said Ms Lee Yin Mui, deputy director of ReCAAP, attributing the decline to Indonesian law enforcement efforts. While 14 sea robbery incidents in the SOMS were reported for July, one incident each was recorded in September and October. Said Mr Chafekar: While the increase in sea robbery incidents in the SOMS highlights the continuing security challenges faced by ships transiting the busy waterway, the decline in incidents following the arrest of perpetrators by the Riau Islands Regional Police illustrates the deterrent effect of effective enforcement. Nevertheless, some would expect that acquiring data and cooperation against piracy from the US authorities would now be harder, given recent developments. OnJan 8,President Donald Trump had ordered the US to withdraw from 66 organisations, comprising non-governmental organisations and United Nations agencies. ReCAAP is one of them. But Mr Chafekar said ReCAAP ISC, which was established in 2006, will continue with its mission. Before the US joined ReCAAP as a contracting party in 2014, ReCAAP was already a working model of regional cooperation against sea piracy, he added. Since joining ReCAAP, the United States has been making a nominal financial contribution every year to support ReCAAP ISCs activities, said Mr Chafekar. The withdrawal of the United States from ReCAAP will not have any impact on the centres operations.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sea-borne-robbery-cases-in-the-straits-of-malacca-and-singapore-the-highest-since-2007

Soh Yuan-Yi, 50, was sentenced to 13 years jail on Jan 8, after shepleadedguilty to 30 charges, including forgery and transferring the benefits from criminal conduct. Another 123 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. Court documents stated that Soh became assistant vice-president of the Swiss bank in 2005, and was promoted to vice-president in 2011, working there until August 2013. Her duties included recommending investment products to clients, carrying out instructions from her clients in relation to their bank accounts and establishing relationships with new or prospective clients. Soh had access to the account information, bank statements and balances of her clients, whoinvested between $2 million and $20 million through Credit Suisse. Between 2006 and 2013, Credit Suisse carried out transactions on its clients accounts by following instructions written on the banks instruction letters. Instruction letters had to be signed by the client for the bank to execute the instructions, and could be submitted through Credit Suisses relationship managers or their assistants. Over seven years, Soh used at least 112 forged instruction letters to perform unauthorised transactions on 22 Credit Suisse accounts belonging to 15 of her clients. These were largely unauthorised withdrawals made to non-Credit Suisse accounts under her control or inter-client transfers to hide the unauthorised withdrawals and losses in her clients accounts. Soh did this by forging her clients signatures, and writing false reasons for the transactions so that the banks back office would process them. She made the unauthorised withdrawals from her clients accounts and transferred the amounts to joint bank accounts she held with her mother and husband. In 2007, she and her husband bought a landed property in Yio Chu Kang for$1.37 million. To make the down payment, Soh forged two instruction letters to issue two cheques worth $110,000 to a joint account with her husband. Of this sum, more than$104,000was used to buy the house. In 2009, Soh and her husband wanted to sell the house to buy another piece of real estate. Unable to find a buyer, she transferred ownership of the property to one of her clients without his knowledge by forging his signature on a purchase agreement stating that he had bought the house for$1.49 million. After the transfer, Soh lied to the client and told him the property was a free gift to him. She then forged instruction letters for over $1.5 million from his account to be transferred to her or the law firm that handled the transaction. The client later sold the property and incurred a loss of more than$86,800. In June 2013, one of her clients complained to the bank that multiple unauthorised transactions had been made on his account. Following internal investigations, Soh was suspended on June 20, 2013. The bank also lodged a police report. Some$9.16 millionhad been transferred out of her clients accounts as a result of Sohs actions. The bank paid the clients affected$14.35 millionto compensate for their losses. Soh has since made repayment of nearly$3.3 millionto the bank. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew told the court that she had taken more than$5.87 millionfrom her clients. Considering her restitution, Soh had a net benefit of more than $2 million. DPP Yew sought a jail term of 15 years and two months jail to 16 years jail for Soh. He said that the offences were premeditated and committed over a long period of time, and had adversely affected the integrity and reputation of Singapores financial system. Not only were a bank and its clients the victims in this case, the accused committed the offences in her capacity as a senior member of the banking community against the bank she was working for and the clients whose interests she was to safeguard. Such offences must be treated harshly, he said. Soh will begin serving her sentence on Jan 29.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-credit-suisse-vp-jailed-13-years-for-forging-transactions-costing-bank-14m-in-compensation

Yayang church, in the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang province, is one of Chinas unregistered churches that emerged as an alternative to places of worship regulated and approved by Beijing. Chinas ruling Communist Party has historically regarded organised religion with suspicion, and under President Xi Jinping, hastightened scrutiny of unofficial groups. The events in Wenzhou come the same week an underground church in the southwestern city of Chengdu said several of its key leaders had been detained. As Beijing tightens its ideological control, unofficial churches are seen as disobedient to the Communist Party ideology and, therefore, pay a heavy price, Mr Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said. Overseas religious rights groups said the crackdown on the Protestant church in the town of Yayang began in mid-December, with reportedly around 100 members initially detained, and two dozen still in custody. AFP has been unable to verify those numbers, but two of the small towns residents confirmed people had been detained in December, though they were unable to give specifics. One local Christian said she thought around 30 people were taken away by police. AFP saw posters on walls and lampposts, dated to Dec 13, calling for public help in capturing two prominent church members, complete with mugshots. The notices said the two men were part of a criminal gang, involved in the crime of provoking trouble. AFP was also able to pinpoint the location of a video posted in mid-December, which showed black-clad police walking in formation towards the direction of the church. The Chinese foreign ministry and local authorities did not immediately respond to a request for official comment. Wenzhous significant Christian population was traditionally seen as wealthy and influential. Before Mr Xi took power, they were able to build their own churches, even competing with the government-sanctioned churches, said Mr Bob Fu, founder of US-based rights group ChinaAid. Earlier this week, Mr Fu posted footage showing scaffolding going up around the church, including the large red cross on top of its main dome. ChinaAid said residents had described the streets surrounding the church as being locked down, enforced by a hefty police presence. When AFP visited on Jan 9, Yayang church was completely covered in blue cladding, but reporters could clearly make out the silhouette of the main dome – now missing its cross. When reporters asked one of the dozen or so guards blocking access to the building what was happening, they declined to comment and told the journalists to move on. Despite otherwise light security, at one point 12 SWAT officers marched briefly up and down a street near the church. Two locals told AFP separately they had been told filming the scaffolding was forbidden, and that a woman had been taken away for doing so. In much of Yayang, residents appeared to be going about their business normally, with buildings frequently displaying posters of crosses. Near the church though, many businesses and residences with crosses on them were shuttered. Churches and rights groups say the campaign against underground churches stepped up in 2025. According to Human Rights Watch, in mid-2025, around a dozen people affiliated with northern Shanxi provinces Linfen Golden Lampstand Church were convicted for fraud. In October 2025, the United States condemned the detention of almost 30 leaders of the unregistered Zion Church across seven cities, including in Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang. Chengdus Early Rain Covenant Church said this week on its Telegram channel that nine of its members, including senior leaders, had been detained in a concerted operation, with two others unaccounted for. Five had now been released, it said. AFP reached out to the church but did not get a response.

Reliances representatives are in discussions with the US State and Treasury departments to obtain the authorisation, the sources said, as Washington and Caracas progress in negotiations to ship 50 million barrels of oil in the aftermath ofthe US capture of President Nicolas Maduro. The Indian conglomerate had received licences from Washington in past years to import crude from US-sanctioned Venezuela for its refining complex, the worlds largest. Venezuelas oil company PDVSA delivered Reliance four crude cargoes or some 63,000 barrels per day in the first four months of 2025 under those authorisations, according to PDVSAs internal records. Washington suspended most licences to PDVSAs business partners between March and April and threatened Venezuelas oil buyers with tariffs as it increased pressure on Mr Maduro. Reliances last cargo of Venezuelan oil arrived in India in May 2025. Reliance said on Jan 8 that it would consider resuming purchases of Venezuelan crude if sales to non-US buyers are permitted under US regulations. The company and the US Treasury Department did not immediately respond to Reuters emails requesting comment on Reliance seeking approval to resume purchases. Chevron, Vitol, Trafigura and other oil companies are vying for licences and control over Venezuelan oil exports. US President Donald Trump is meeting with oil executives at the White House later on Jan 9. The South American producer has millions of barrels of crude stuck in onshore tanks and vessels. US officials have said they wouldcontrol Venezuelan oil exports indefinitely,and that some oil would flow to non-US buyers. Mr Trump said China, the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil, will not be deprived of barrels. Reliance is willing to buy Venezuelan oil from US companies and others with drilling rights in Venezuela if crude is offered at attractive rates, said one of the sources. Venezuelan oil supplies could help replace someRussian supplies to India.Reliance was the biggest Indian buyer of Russian oil but has said it would not receive any cargo of Russian crude this month as India is under pressure from Mr Trump to stop importing Russian barrels. Reliances two refineries in western Gujarat state, with a combined capacity of about 1.4 million bpd of crude oil, allow it to process cheaper and heavier crudes such as Venezuelas Merey. Reliance and PDVSA have a long-standing relationship, and India was the third most important market for Venezuelas crude before the US imposed sanctions on oil trade, taking some 400,000 bpd.

Wang Yis planned visit would have been the first by a Chinese foreign minister since the 1980s. It had been expected to provide Mogadishu with a diplomatic boost after Israel became the first country to formally recognise the breakaway Republic of Somaliland, a northern region that declared its independence in 1991. Somalias relations with the U.S. are also at a low point after Washington said this week it would pause further assistance that benefits the government over a dispute about the demolition of a World Food Programme warehouse. Somali foreign affairs ministry officials told Reuters that the reason for the postponement and a future schedule for Wangs visit would be provided later. Chinas foreign affairs ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Wang began his annual New Years tour of Africa on Wednesday, focusing on strategic trade access across East and Southern Africa as Beijing seeks to secure critical shipping routes and resource supply lines. He arrived in Dar es Salaam on Friday for a two-day working visit, Tanzanias foreign ministry said in a post on its X account. It added that the visit aims to strengthen bilateral relations and deepen economic ties between the two nations. Wang met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Thursday and called for greater cooperation with Africas fastest-growing economy, including in infrastructure, green industry, and the digital economy.

The island of more than 23 million people faces a looming demographic challenge, with its population falling overall as well as ageing. There were 4,673,155 people aged 65 or older in Taiwan in 2025, or 20.06 per cent of the population, according to the interior ministry. That means it met the World Health Organisations criteria for a super-aged society, with one in every five citizens aged 65 or more. The number of people aged 0-14 accounted for 11.51 per cent of the population, the ministrys data showed. Only 9,027 newborns were recorded in December 2025, a decrease of 27 per cent from a year earlier, with the total number of newborns in 2025 hitting a record low of 107,812. The crude birth rate, based on the number of childbirths per 1,000 people each year, came in at 4.56 in December. Taiwans population shrank for the first time in 2020, while its birth rate has been falling continuously for two decades. Demographers say Taiwanese women are increasingly getting married at an older age, opting for smaller families, or choosing to stay single. Rising living costs and insufficient childcare support have also forced some working women to postpone plans to become mothers.

REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro/File Photo","['Pakistan', 'Media', 'Saudi Arabia']","ISLAMABAD, Jan 9 - Pakistan is in the final phases of striking a $1.5-billion deal to supply weapons and jets to Sudan, a former top air force official and three sources said, promising a major boost for Sudans army, battling the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. Their conflict has stoked the worlds worst humanitarian crisis for more than 2-1/2 years, drawing in myriad foreign interests, and threatening to fragment the strategic Red Sea country, a major gold producer. The deal with Pakistan encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for scouting and kamikaze attacks, and advanced air defence systems, said two of the three sources with knowledge of the matter, who all sought anonymity. It was a done deal, said Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters. Besides the Karakoram-8 jets, it includes Super Mushshak training aircraft, and perhaps some coveted JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China and produced in Pakistan, he added, without giving figures or a delivery schedule. Pakistans military and its defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Sudans army did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment. Assistance from Pakistan, especially drones and jets, could help Sudans army regain the air supremacy it had towards the start of its war with the RSF, which has increasingly used drones to gain territory, eroding the armys position. Sudans army accuses the RSF of being supplied by the United Arab Emirates, which has denied supplying weapons. POSSIBILITY OF SAUDI BACKING The sources did not say how the deal was being funded but Masood said it was possible the finances would come from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia may favour and support all the favourable regimes in Gulf for procurement of Pakistani military equipment and training, he said. One of the sources said the Saudis brokered the deal but added there was no indication they were paying for the weapons. Another source said Saudi was not providing funds. Reuters has reported that Islamabad is in talks with Riyadh for a defence deal that could be worth between $2 billion and $4 billion. Masood said the weapons for Sudan could be included in such an agreement, without confirming discussions with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of the U.S.-led quad grouping of nations that has tried to push Sudans army and the RSF towards peace talks. On recent visits, Sudans army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan requested Saudi assistance in the war, according to Sudanese and Egyptian sources. Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are embroiled in a major feud sparked by recent events in Yemen. The two most powerful countries in the Gulf have sharp differences on a range of volatile Middle East issues, from geopolitics to oil output. Their difference burst into the open with an advance of UAE-backed southern Yemeni separatists in early December that brought them into conflict with Saudi-backed forces. PAKISTANS DEFENCE AMBITIONS The deal is another feather in the cap for Pakistans growing defence sector, which has drawn growing interest and investment, particularly since its jets were deployed in a conflict with India last year. Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion with the Libyan National Army, officials said, for one of the South Asian nations largest arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft. Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on a defence deal that could includes the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve ties with Dhaka. The government sees Pakistans burgeoning industry as a catalyst to secure long-term economic stability. Pakistan is now in a $7-billion IMF programme, following a short-term deal to avert a sovereign default in 2023. It won IMF support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.

Royalties collected from commercial facilities are currently paid only to songwriters and composers, with Japan now racing to catch up with a policy already adopted in 142 countries and regions to better protect artistes rights. Japans Agency for Cultural Affairs put forward its plans to its deliberative council and is expected to submit the revised copyright Bill to the ordinary parliamentary session set to begin on Jan 23. The amount of royalties collected from the use of background music in commercial facilities is currently determined by the size of the establishment, according to the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers. A store measuring about 500 sq m pays around 6,000 yen (S$49)a year, with the fees distributed to so-called copyright holders, who are limited to songwriters and composers. Musicians, including singers and instrumentalists, as well as record labels, are not entitled to remuneration. The initial report submitted to the council said the agency aims to harmonise with international policies and advocate paying performers. It also called for about three years to raise public awareness of the revised law and to take into account the burden on smaller businesses. While the move has garnered support as a boost to the entertainment industry, some have called for measures to ease the additional costs.KYODO NEWS",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-to-pay-royalties-to-artistes-record-labels-for-background-music-use

Resolutions pushing for a full pardon and demanding justice for Najib were the hottest topic submitted by the partys 191 divisions ahead of its annual assembly, secretary-general Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki said at a briefing on Jan 9. Some 104 divisions submitted resolutions calling for the release of Najib, who has multiple convictions for his role in the 1MDB fraud that cost the country billions. The resolutions show the strength of support retained by Najib, 72, who in Decemberlost a bid to servethe remainder of a six-year prison sentence at home. He was subsequently convicted of abuse of power and money laundering, and handed a US$2.8 billion (S$3.6 billion) fine anda further 15 years in prison. All the convictions were in connection with 1MDB, a failed state-run fund whose collapse sparked probes from Singapore to Switzerland. Datuk Dr Asyraf said that despite recent calls for the party to leave Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahims government – triggered by another coalition members gloating over Najibs failed bid for house arrest – no resolution to withdraw has been submitted to the party ahead of the meeting. Its not going to be a big issue in this years assembly, Mr Asyraf said. Umno Youth chief Akmal Saleh last week called for the party to leave the government. The youth wing would propose that Umno revive its cooperation with the opposition Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS). Umno president Zahid Hamidi has previously shot down suggestions that the party should leave the government, reiterating a commitment to remain in the coalition until the next nationwide election that must be held by early 2028. Datuk Seri Zahid serves as deputy prime minister in Datuk Seri Anwars Cabinet, and sawhis own graft case dropped by prosecutorsdays before the assembly, which runs from Jan 14 to Jan 17. Any bid for a pardon must go through Malaysias current king, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar. Najib previously had a sentence reduced by Sultan Ibrahims predecessor, Sultan Abdullah Ahmad, who hails from the former premiers home state of Pahang. Najib was ousted when Umno, which had ruled Malaysia for six decades, lost power in 2018 after the 1MDB scandal. It became part of Mr Anwars coalition in 2022.

REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi",['Police'],"ALEPPO, Syria, Jan 9 - The Syrian army said it would push into the last Kurdish-held district of Aleppo city on Friday after Kurdish groups there rejected a government demand for their fighters to withdraw under a ceasefire deal. The violence in Aleppo has brought into focus one of the main faultlines in Syria as the country tries to rebuild after a devastating war, with Kurdish forces resisting efforts by President Ahmed al-Sharaas Islamist-led government to bring their fighters under centralised authority. At least nine civilians have been killed and more than 140,000 have fled their homes in Aleppo, where Kurdish forces are trying to cling on to several neighbourhoods they have run since the early days of the war, which began in 2011. ِA ceasefire was announced by the defence ministry overnight, demanding the withdrawal of Kurdish forces to the Kurdish-held northeast. That would effectively end Kurdish control over the pockets of Aleppo that Kurdish forces have held. CEASEFIRE FAILED, SECURITY OFFICIALS SAY But in a statement, Kurdish councils that run Aleppos Sheikh Maksoud and Ashrafiyah districts said calls to leave were a call to surrender and that Kurdish forces would instead defend their neighbourhoods, accusing government forces of intensive shelling. Hours later, the Syrian army said that the deadline for Kurdish fighters to withdraw had expired, and that it would begin a military operation to clear the last Kurdish-held neighbourhood of Sheikh Maksoud. Two Syrian security officials told Reuters the ceasefire efforts had failed and that the army would seize the neighbourhood by force. The Syrian defence ministry had earlier carried out strikes on parts of Sheikh Maksoud that it said were being used by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to launch attacks on the people of Aleppo. It said on Friday that SDF strikes had killed three army soldiers. Kurdish security forces in Aleppo said some of the strikes hit a hospital, calling it a war crime. The defence ministry disputed that, saying the structure was a large arms depot and that it had been destroyed in the resumption of strikes on Friday. It posted an aerial video that it said showed the location after the strikes, and said secondary explosions were visible, proving it was a weapons cache. Reuters could not immediately verify the claim. The SDF is a powerful Kurdish-led security force that controls northeastern Syria. It says it withdrew its fighters from Aleppo last year, leaving Kurdish neighbourhoods in the hands of the Kurdish Asayish police. Under an agreement with Damascus last March the SDF was due to integrate with the defence ministry by the end of 2025, but there has been little progress. FRANCE, U.S. SEEK DE-ESCALATION Frances foreign ministry said it was working with the United States to de-escalate. A ministry statement said President Emmanuel Macron had urged Sharaa on Thursday to exercise restraint and reiterated Frances commitment to a united Syria where all segments of Syrian society are represented and protected. A Western diplomat told Reuters that mediation efforts were focused on calming the situation and producing a deal that would see Kurdish forces leave Aleppo and provide security guarantees for Kurds who remained. The diplomat said U.S. envoy Tom Barrack was en route to Damascus. A spokesperson for Barrack declined to comment. Washington has been closely involved in efforts to promote integration between the SDF - which has long enjoyed U.S. military support - and Damascus, with which the United States has developed close ties under President Donald Trump. The ceasefire declared by the government overnight said Kurdish forces should withdraw by 9 a.m. (0600 GMT) on Friday, but no one withdrew overnight, Syrian security sources said. Barrack had welcomed what he called a temporary ceasefire and said Washington was working intensively to extend it beyond the 9 a.m. deadline. We are hopeful this weekend will bring a more enduring calm and deeper dialogue, he wrote on X. TURKISH WARNING Turkey views the SDF as a terrorist organisation linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and has warned of military action if it does not honour the integration agreement. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, speaking on Thursday, expressed hope that the situation in Aleppo would be normalised through the withdrawal of SDF elements. Though Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who belongs to the Sunni Muslim majority, has repeatedly vowed to protect minorities, bouts of violence in which government-aligned fighters have killed hundreds of Alawites and Druze have spread alarm in minority communities over the last year. The Kurdish councils in Aleppo said Damascus could not be trusted with our security and our neighbourhoods, and that attacks on the areas aimed to bring about displacement. Sharaa, in a phone call with Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani on Friday, affirmed that the Kurds were a fundamental part of the Syrian national fabric, the Syrian presidency said. Neither the government nor the Kurdish forces have announced a toll of casualties among their fighters from the recent clashes.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein","['Infrastructure', 'Energy', 'Venezuela']","Jan 9 - U.S. oil executives being summoned to the White House on Friday to discuss potential investment plans in Venezuela will be carefully weighing the countrys business potential and enthusiasm from President Donald Trump with a more cautious sentiment being expressed by some of their investors. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, speaking at a Goldman Sachs energy conference in Miami this week, repeated a claim from Trump that U.S. oil firms were prepared to spend billions of dollars to rebuild the South American countrys oil economy after U.S. forces removed Nicolás Maduro from power on Saturday. Some energy investors were skeptical, however, and questioned the cost of any such spending in Venezuela, which holds the worlds largest estimated crude reserves. They also had ongoing concerns about the countrys political stability and whether they could trust the interim government in Caracas being run by Delcy Rodriguez. Investors will want to see long-lasting stability and good fiscal terms to protect against the risk of asset nationalization, which weve seen from Venezuela in the past, said David Byrns, portfolio manager and senior investment analyst at American Century Investments, which is a major Chevron and Exxon Mobil shareholder. Multiple attendees of private meetings held by Chevron and ConocoPhillips at the Miami conference told Reuters that executives from those companies offered few insights into Venezuela, but made one thing clear: they did not intend to make rash decisions. Chevron and Conoco did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Friday, Trump is expected to urge oil executives to invest and help boost Venezuelas crude production during a meeting attended by Wright, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and 17 major firms. The companies represented will include ConocoPhillips, Exxon, Chevron, along with Spains Repsol and trading firms Vitol and Trafigura, according to sources familiar with the matter. The American people, energy companies, and the Venezuelan people will all greatly benefit from these new, unprecedented investments in Venezuelas oil infrastructure thanks to President Trump, said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers. Chevron already operates in the country, but Exxon and Conoco departed nearly 20 years ago after their assets were nationalized and are still owed billions of dollars. The tension is between the compelling geological resource and the obvious business opportunity, and the considerable above-ground risk, uncertainty and unpaid claims, said Geoffrey Pyatt, former Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources in the Biden administration. Foreign embassies in Venezuela are beginning to arrange visits for next week that will include representatives for American and European oil companies, two sources told Reuters on Thursday. Matthew Sallee, head of investments at fund manager Tortoise Capital, which owns shares in Chevron, said he could support further Venezuela investments if Chevron could show returns paying out, but he would be very cautious because infrastructure in the country is so dilapidated. If Chevron says were going to dedicate multi-billion dollars a year to Venezuela, we would probably sell, he said. Service companies, which could be among the first to benefit from any rush into Venezuela as infrastructure gets rebuilt, have tried to curb any immediate enthusiasm. We have a yard in Colombia, across the border, that could deliver rigs into the region, and we understand what it takes to work there, but we need to make sure that the timing is right and that we have the right customer-partner relationship going in, said Helmerich & Payne President Trey Adams, speaking at the Miami conference. QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICAL INSTABILITY STILL LOOM Ali Moshiri, Chevrons former president of Africa and Latin America, who is now CEO of Amos Global Energy, said his firm planned to enter Venezuela and was in early-stage talks with U.S. government departments for public funding, and with service companies to repair infrastructure and build pipelines. But despite overwhelming interest from investors, the plan would be contingent on the U.S. determining who will manage the transition period in the country, he added. That decision must be made, it is the precondition for investors, Moshiri said. While Trump has said the U.S. intends to control Venezuela, how that plays out on the ground remains unclear, especially given questions about how different spheres of power in Caracas will get along in the absence of Maduro. The U.S. has a three-step plan for Venezuela that will begin with stabilization, followed by a recovery phase ensuring U.S. oil companies have access to the country and finally a transition, Rubio said on Wednesday. Some U.S. oil companies may worry they could be pressured to enter Venezuela quickly or potentially face repercussions down the road, said Samantha Carl-Yoder, co-chair of the international practice at lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. Companies may feel they have to go back in to get things they want in other areas. Will the administration hold permits and licensing hostage? Will the administration provide some financial incentives to companies going in? Those are questions I would have if I were an integrated oil company, she said.

REUTERS/Gaby Oraa","['Prisons', 'Human rights', 'People']","Jan 9 - Nine people considered political prisoners by a leading Venezuelan rights group had been released by Friday afternoon as part of an effort praised by U.S. President Donald Trump, the group said, with families of others anxiously waiting to hear if their relatives would also be freed. Human rights groups, international bodies and opposition figures - including Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies imprisoned - have long demanded the release from Venezuelan jails of some 800 people they consider political prisoners. Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier on Friday that he had canceled a second wave of attacks on Venezuela following cooperation from the South American nation, and that Venezuela was releasing large numbers of political prisoners. Both Venezuelas top lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez, the brother of acting President Delcy Rodriguez, and Trump said the releases are a gesture of peace. There is no official list of exactly how many prisoners will be released nor who they are. The releases come during a week of political turmoil in Caracas after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro, his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, the swearing-in of interim President Delcy Rodriguez and the announcement that the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude oil stuck in Venezuela under U.S. sanctions. For years, Venezuelas opposition and human rights groups have said the government uses detentions to stamp out dissent. The authorities have consistently denied that and have said the prisoners were rightfully jailed for committing crimes. The families of both prominent and little-known detainees gathered outside prisons on Friday, or visited multiple detention centers in an attempt to discover the location and status of their loved ones. Leading local rights group Foro Penal estimates that after the releases this week there are 811 political prisoners still being held in the country. That figure includes more than 80 foreign detainees, including two from the United States and one with American residency. Five Spanish citizens, including Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist Rocio San Miguel, were the first confirmed releases on Thursday. They arrived in Madrid the following day. Also released late on Thursday were former Venezuelan opposition presidential candidate Enrique Marquez, journalist Biagio Pilieri and soldier Larry Osorio, said Alfredo Romero, the director of Foro Penal. Opposition member Aracelis Balza was released on Friday. We are waiting to hear what the authorities here have to say. I found out through social media that they were releasing people, said Gregory Trejo, as he waited outside El Rodeo prison in Guatire, near capital Caracas, for news of his father, Jose Gregorio Trejo, detained for nearly a year. For there to be a democratic transition in a democratic country, there cannot be political prisoners, and we demand the release of all those who are in all detention centers, said Soraida Gonzalez, who was awaiting the release of her son Jose Miguel Estrada. Among prominent detained figures are opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha, both close allies of Machado; Rafael Tudares, son-in-law of the oppositions former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez; opposition Voluntad Popular party leaders Freddy Superlano and Roland Carreno; and Javier Tarazona, director of an NGO that tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military.

Both cities are facing famine. More than 100,000 are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since the RSF took control there following an 18-month siege. OCHA said it is looking to make Sudan the first country to sign an agreement with the United States to receive part of the $2 billion in assistance it pledged at the end of December. More than 21 million people are currently estimated to be acutely food insecure across the country. Some 34 million people are in need of humanitarian support, half of whom are children, according to the U.N.

He astutely observed that the zone has moved beyond concept to meaningfully capture investor attention, serving as a litmus test for ASEANs ability to build resilient, border-transcending growth. Indeed, the JS-SEZ has evolved into a major regional priority, attracting significant investment. It represents a modern economic model, moving beyond cheap labour to prioritise proximity, resilience and sustainability. The complementary strengths of Singapores global connectivity and Johors land and manufacturing base create a powerful formula for supply-chain security, allowing companies to withstand global shocks. But as Mr Dujacquier noted, the real test lies in execution, not ambition. Physical bridges like the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link are crucial, but the bureaucratic bridge of regulatory alignment is paramount. The formidable challenge is not infrastructure, but harmonising rules and processes. History shows incentives alone cannot compensate for weak fundamentals. To succeed in the long term, the JS-SEZ must adopt transformative measures. There needs to be a joint statutory authority with the power to fast-track approvals, and a regulatory sandbox for innovation. A digital-first border with seamless biometric clearance and shared platforms must be built, making the crossing feel invisible and turning pilot schemes into reality. Critically, success depends on people. A shared skills and innovation corridor is essential to prepare the workforce for the 400,000 high-income jobs that the JS-SEZ is aiming to create. A future skills fund can ensure inclusive growth by upskilling locals, mitigating social risks like housing affordability. Furthermore, investment incentives should be tied to tangible outcomes like high-quality job creation, and not just be blanket tax holidays. The ultimate measure of success will not be short-term factory counts, but whether in 15 years, the border feels like a seam within a single, fluid and globally competitive ecosystem.

Forum: Singapore Biennale deserves structural support,"Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Singapore Biennale', 'Arts festivals']","I refer to the Opinion article Time to shut down the Singapore Biennale? (Jan 6). The issue is less about artistic outcomes than about how leadership, responsibility and planning are organised around one of Singapores key public instruments for contemporary thought and expression. A biennale is more than a periodic exhibition. It shapes how a nation articulates ideas, participates in regional and international artistic discourse, and builds confidence in its public voice. In a city state such as Singapore, it also contributes to how civic identity is represented in the public sphere. Now in its eighth edition, the Singapore Biennale is no longer an emergent project. By this stage, it should have consolidated lessons learnt, strengthened institutional capability, and developed a clearer long-term trajectory. If structural constraints persist, the question is not whether the Biennale holds value, but whether its organisational model is carrying the responsibility expected of a national initiative of this scale. The Biennale should serve as a focal platform, offering a publicly accessible space for artistic inquiry where imagination and spectacle do not eclipse meaning, while anchoring and lending coherence to arts events and practitioners that strengthen the marketplace and professional ecosystem. This includes the work of art fairs, private galleries, independent institutions, art colleges, and self-organised artists and curators. At present, both the Singapore Biennale and the national pavilion at the Venice Biennale sit within a single museum structure whose mandate already spans research, collections oversight and institutional programming. Concentrating these responsibilities within one framework stretches capacity and constrains leadership renewal. It also limits the circulation of curatorial perspectives outside institutional and academic frames, where ideas can be more agile and more closely attuned to artistic practice, as well as to social and global contexts.

Forum: Ensuring accessible and fair resolution of workplace discrimination,"Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Ministry of Manpower', 'Employers']","We refer to the commentary Taking employers to task over discrimination: How easy is the legal process? (Dec 29) by Ms Sugidha Nithiananthan and Ms Caitlin C. Fernandez, and Ms Mizue SaucosForum letter, Improve access to justice at the Employment Claims Tribunal (Jan 6). The Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Act provides a structured avenue for redress starting with direct engagement between parties. If resolution fails, mandatory mediation follows before a case can proceed to adjudication. This tiered approach emphasises amicable outcomes to preserve workplace harmony. The Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) offers a simplified and guided process that is accessible, affordable, and expeditious with safeguards against frivolous claims. The Acts framework does not permit legal representation at the ECT; however, workers and employers may seek legal advice outside proceedings or assistance through their respective unions. Judges in ECT proceedings proactively identify relevant issues and see that pertinent evidence is presented. To assist litigants who may not be legally trained, registrars will provide procedural guidance. As Ms Sauco notes, self-presented parties may apply for family members or friends to provide non-legal support during hearings, via the Community Courts and Tribunals Friend Scheme. More details are available on theSG Courts website (self-help guides). The decisions of the ECT – as courts of law – must be grounded in evidence where parties must prove their case. These procedural rules are essential to ensure that credible evidence is presented and that employers and workers are treated equally. The ECT ensures due process through a rigorous procedure and has maintained a consistent pace in doing so. While the duration between the filing of the claim and the first case management conference varies, most cases continue to be concluded within six months, notwithstanding a 67 per cent increase in claims between 2021 and 2025. The judiciary continues to refine its processes to remain user-centric and accessible, including modernising digital platforms for audio and video evidence submission. Workplace discrimination cases can be complex, and public awareness and education are key. The Ministry of Manpower and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices are stepping up public outreach and education efforts, including the development of a handbook to provide clear and practical guidance to help employers and workers understand and apply the law in the workplace.

His daughter Lindy Chia told Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao that her father had been hospitalised during the Christmas period and was discharged on Dec 31, after which he went on a cruise. However, David Chia suddenly collapsed due to a cerebralhaemorrhageat about 3am on Jan 2 while the cruise ship was sailing near Melaka. Due to the emergency, a connecting boat took my father from the cruise ship to a hospital in Melaka on shore, Ms Chia, 49, told Zaobao. My younger brother was with him at the time, and I immediately arranged for an ambulance to take him from the Melaka hospital back to Singapore overnight. She added that her father was not in a good condition after being admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, with tubes inserted all over his body. He had been struggling for many days and the family braced themselves for the worst, she said. He suddenly got out of bed on Jan 6 and walked around, but that night, his breathing became laboured. He suffered from severe pulmonary edema and was in agony, constantly trying to pull out the tubes. The moment he took his last breath was peaceful and serene. We didnt want him to suffer. Chia, who is better known by his Chinese name Xie Jinshi, told Zaobao in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in June that year. He remained positive and optimistic despite significant weight loss during treatment and continued teaching singing. He joined the local radio drama industry after participating in the Rediffusion Hokkien Singing Contest in 1972, according to Chinese-language evening daily Shin Min Daily News. In 1979, he secured an opportunity to record Hokkien songs on vinyl records, marking his entry into the music industry. He also performed in lounges and served as a singing coach for decades. He was slated to perform with local veteran actor-host Marcus Chin on Jan 17 after his year-end holiday, followed by a performance with a wind orchestra on Feb 8. My fathers songs and sheet music were all prepared, and he originally planned to start rehearsals after the cruise trip, Ms Chia said. She recalled that her father loved to be out and about, and even during his cancer treatment, he could not stay still and did not consider himself a patient. He lived a more exciting life than I did, she said. He had been to many places – Canada, Las Vegas in the United States and Huangshan in China, and even went whitewater rafting in New Zealand.

The smell things matter for Chinas luxury car brand Hongqi,"Jan 09, 2026, 04:15 PM","Jan 09, 2026, 04:15 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a945bed1508a6824639de0551b0bd8e484acf474ddb95e190e76bb8659794b6a,"Mr Liu Jifang (left), spokesman for Hongqi, with Mr Collin Teo, chief operating officer of Eurokars Group, with the Hongqi Guoli, an ultra-high-end limousine.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO","['Cars', 'Electric and hybrid vehicles', 'China']","SINGAPORE – One whiff of the plush leather-lined cabin of the lilac-coloured sport utility vehicle (SUV) will tell you exactly where Hongqi sits in the automotive kingdom. The air is better at the top and Chinas most prestigious heritage brand, which means red flag in Chinese, has landed in Singapore. The cabin may even be hypoallergenic, given that nothing triggers this writers often overactive sinuses after 10 minutes in the show car on display at Singapore Motorshow 2026, which takes place from Jan 8 to 11. As it turns out, the olfactory delight is no accident. Speaking to The Straits Times on Jan 8, 2026 at the event held at the Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre, Mr Liu Jifang, the Chinese brands representative for this part of the world, says every Hongqi car goes through extensive development to engineer how the cabin smells. This is part of what luxury means for the brand, where we focus on the customers needs and comfort, he adds in Mandarin. The work to prevent jarring scents in the cabin involves meticulously examining the materials used, from upholstery to adhesives. Mr Liu is a senior executive with China FAW Group, the state-owned company behind Hongqi. In addition to South-east Asia, he oversees the brands operations in Central Asia and Latin America. Singapore is the first right-hand-drive market in the world for Hongqi, ahead of Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong. In the second half of 2026, the United Kingdom, Australia and Malaysia will be added to the list. Even though Hongqi has been building cars since 1958, well before other Chinese brands, it is a relative latecomer to the export market. However, Mr Liu says in these overseas markets, Hongqis luxury positioning sets it apart from Chinese counterparts that tend to have a more mass-market focus. Hongqi began to export around the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, starting with European countries such as Denmark and Norway. Then it went on to the Middle East and Central Asia. In 2025, Latin America was added to the global distribution network, and 2026 marks its foray into right-hand-drive markets. While many familiar Chinese brands compete in the mass-market segment, Hongqi is about luxury, told through our brand story, products and premium customer service experience, says Mr Liu, when asked to describe the positioning. He adds that the customers in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America appreciate how Hongqi differentiates itself from Chinese brands, which tend to compete more on aggressive pricing in those places. Instead of comparing against rivals, we are guided by our customers preferences and needs. We listen to their feedback about our products and refine them, he continues. Getting Hongqis positioning right and also conveying the brands history and car-making experience are all crucial to the ability to grow in its export markets, he says. Without this knowledge, consumers will regard us as yet another Chinese car brand, he adds. Hongqi sits at the pinnacle of Chinese brands in its home market, and its cars have the price tags to match. The Guoli limousine, which was also previewed at the Singapore Motorshow, was launched in China in 2024 with a price tag of 7.18 million yuan (S$1.32 million). For context, the Zeekr 009 Grand, a luxury four-seater multi-purpose vehicle, retails for 789,000 yuan. Hongqi also builds the state limousine used by Chinese President Xi Jinping and the countrys other top leaders, adding to the brands prestige. Exporting out of China has meant that Hongqi has to take the legislations, driving conditions and user preferences of foreign locales into consideration. For example, to cater to the frigid winters in Central Asia, the steering and seat heating systems were beefed up. The advanced driver assistance systems on board were also developed with European consumers and legislations in mind. Mr Liu says that through customer workshops and feedback from its dealer partners, Hongqi constantly improves its products. Besides those in the works, it also refines cars that are already delivered to customers through over-the-air updates. The first Hongqi model for Singapore is the E-HS9, an electric SUV about the size of the long-wheelbase Range Rover. The car is expected to be priced at less than $500,000 when it is officially launched around April. This will put it in the region of the Porsche Cayenne and other luxury European SUVs. After the E-HS9 arrives, the brands portfolio in Singapore will be expanded with several models within the next 12 months or so, says Mr Liu. Besides fully electric models, Hongqi has petrol hybrids, plug-in hybrids and extended range electric vehicles (EVs), which incorporate a small combustion engine to charge up the EVs battery to boost range. Mr Liu says the mix of technologies available allows the brand to offer the ideal solution for consumers. This means that Singapore could see plug-in hybrid Hongqi models in the future, although nothing has been confirmed. The brand appointed Eurokars Group as its Singapore distributor in 2025. The multi-franchise dealer group, owned by motor industry magnate Karsono Kwee, will house Hongqi in a new dedicated showroom at 19 Leng Kee Road. The group represents a host of car brands in Singapore, from the mass-market ones like Mazda and MG, to premium names such as BMW and Mini, to the ultra-luxury brands, including McLaren, Rolls-Royce and Pagani. Mr Collin Teo, chief operating officer of Eurokars Group, tells ST that response from prospects has been very positive since it wasannouncedin July 2025 that the Hongqi brand was coming to Singapore. These prospects are experienced consumers who are open to new luxury car options. Rather than taking the traditional retail route, Mr Teo adds, Eurokars recognises Hongqis unique identity and will take a more bespoke luxury approach to build up the brand in Singapore. We will focus on delivering a premium luxury experience, from the initial purchase to the aftersales service... to build the brand integrally and sustainably.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/motoring/the-smell-things-matter-for-chinas-luxury-car-brand-hongqi

But about two years ago, the cult kitchen brand founded by American businessman Earl Tupper in 1942, and which provided flexible work for women in a post-World War II world, filed for bankruptcy. Tupperware Brands Corporation transitioned from a public entity to a privately held company following a court-approved sale in October 2024 to avoid total liquidation. The Tupperware brand and its related operating assets are now owned byParty Products,a group of Tupperwares lenders including New York-based hedge funds Stonehill Capital Management and Alden Global Capital. Itacquired Tupperwares global rights, brand and operations after the founding company became insolvent. The new entity will initially focus on offering Tupperware products in certain core markets, including Singapore. Tupperwares full range is now available at major department stores, including Metro, Tangs, Takashimaya, OG and Isetan. Expect to also see the complete line-up on Tupperwares official online stores on Lazada and Shopee, as well as its local distributor Fackelmann Singapores webstore, from February. And in the later part of 2026, there will be roll-outs at major supermarkets across the island. In Singapore, Party Products research shows that customers value the ease of buying directly from stores or online. In the US, the model is omnichannel, allowing for direct selling, online and retail. Since the 1950s, Tupperware parties were not just about selling homeware, but also about building social capital, where women could gather outside the confines of the domestic sphere. I recall vividly my sister, Ms Sarojaini Nair – the eldest in our family of eight children – handing out local tea-time treats such as curry puffs and samosastorelatives and neighbours during the Tupperware parties she hosted in the late 1960s. Her guests were invited to browse glossy cataloguesof theAmericanplastic food storage brand at our three-room flat in Prince Charles Crescent, off Alexandra Road, as well as in the homes of other Tupperware party hosts. Party hosts had to undergo special training to demonstrate the burpable lid, also known as the burp seal, a hallmark of Tupperwares design.Its main function was to create a partial vacuum which locks air out and keeps freshness in. The assortment of spill-proof tumblers, covered serving bowls and airtight canisters in sleek designs and hues were an instant hit. Guests made orders which my sister later delivered by hand, with a promise of more parties and treats when stocks were replenished. By the 1990s and early 2000s, the brands hallmark stacks still signalled thrift and order in many Singaporean and overseas kitchens, even as hypermarkets and thrift shops began offering cheaper, no-name containers. Starting from the late 1990s, cheaper forms of industrial plastics in foodware began to raise concerns. Mounting evidence about chemicals such asbisphenol A (BPA) and some phthalates became the focus of mainstream discussions and government regulation. BPA is a harmful chemical used as an industrial hardener in cheap plastic products. Prolonged exposure to it can cause a range of health problems, including cancer. Phthalates are a group of synthetic chemicals used to make plastics softer and more flexible. They are colourless, often oily liquids found in many consumer products such as food packaging. The status of plastic itself began to change in recent years. Where earlier generations prized durability and shatterproof convenience, younger consumers schooled in climate change began to equate plastics with landfills, and to picture oceans choked with waste and microplastics. Glass jars, stainless-steel lunch boxes and beeswax wraps gained a halo of virtue, while plastic – however robust – started to look dated in a new moral economy of materiality. Also, changes in peoples shopping habits weighed heavilyon the direct sales model.The classic party plan model depended on stay-home hosts, neighbourly networks and a few hours of attention focused on a consultants sales pitch and demonstrations. As dual-income households became the norm in the 2000s and socialising migrated to e-commerce, malls and hipster cafes, fewer people had the time or inclination to sit through a sales party in someones home. Younger shoppers, used to the dopamine hit of clicking add to cart, saw little reason to wait for a group order to be consolidated, processed anddelivered by hand. Design-savvy global labels such as Pyrex and LocknLock started introducing modular glass systems and sleek bento-style lunch boxes that were imbued with minimalist Instagram-worthy aesthetics. Responding to these seismic shifts, the new Tupperware collections have been redesigned to adapt to the way people live today. The productsare free of BPA and phthalates. Some of the materialsthe brand now tapsinclude polypropylene, a durable and safe plastic widely used in food storage containers; and low-density polyethylene, used for solid containers and deemed safe for food storage. The household name nowoffers a new range that is said to be specially treated to be safe for modern consumers, through the use of food-grade resins that comply with global safety standards, such as the US Food and Drug Administrations criteria for consumer products. The materials are tested for non-migration– meaning they are durable, chemically inert, moisture-resistant and engineered in a way that prevents the leaching of harmful chemicals, dyes or additives into food and drinks. Although the brand has changed hands, its legacy continues as Party Products aims to deliver innovative designs that consumers trust, while supporting Tupperwares community of sellers and expanding retail partnerships. Besides the classic designs of stackable plastic containers with one-press airtight lids,there are also new designs in pastels, a Freezer Mate range featuring flexible, crack-resistant material and a CrystalWave collection, with steam-venting valves for safe, splatter-free microwave heating. A highlight is the Tupperware Voila Glass collection. Launched in the US in late 2025, it is the brands first foray into glass containers in its nearly 80-year history.The collection is expected to be in department stores herelater in 2026. The move into glass was a strategic response to consumer demand for plastic alternatives and offers features – such as borosilicate glass – which are said to be safe for the oven, microwave, freezer and fridge,paired with lids that have steam vents to reduce splatter and promote even heating. The range is designed for cooking, baking, serving, storing and reheating in one dish, which also helps reduce dish clutter. A set of four nestable glass containers is priced at US$65 (S$83) ontupperware.com, which is currently available only in the US. A core part of Tupperwares sustainability story is that well-made containers, bottles and cups can be used for many years, reducing the use of cheap plastic boxes that crack, stain or warp and are quickly thrown away. The current range in Singapore stores ispricedfrom $12 for a 550ml Modular Mates Oval Food Container to $149 for a set of 10 Modular Mates Oval Dry Food Container of various sizes. A spokesperson for Takashimaya saysTupperwareadds value by offering a trusted, functional household brand that appeals to a wide customer base. With renewed colours and improved designs, Tupperware delivers thoughtful innovation that meets shoppers demand for smart, practical lifestyle solutions. Fackelmann Singapores commercial manager Wendy Tan says that although Tupperware is back in a big way, it is not the same as before. Its being sold on a bigger scale globally and its also better. This is because we have combined Tupperwares 78-year legacy of engineering excellence with Fackelmanns global retail expertise, addsMs Tan. The family-owned German multinational founded in 1919 manufactures and distributes a range of household products, specialising in kitchen gadgets, bakeware and bathroom furnishings. By moving into Singapores premier department stores, we are making the worlds most trusted sustainable storage solutions more accessible than ever, ensuring that the New Tupperware collections fit seamlessly into the Singaporean homemakers fast-paced, eco-conscious lifestyle.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/home-design/cult-brand-tupperware-reinvents-itself-for-a-longer-shelf-life

The satellite controls on the steering spokes have also been reimagined. Instead of being glossy, touch-sensitive switches, physical buttons are used, which should be more tactile and less prone to being activated accidentally. As a treat for Volkswagen fans, the digital display ahead of the driver has a cheeky retro setting, which is modelled after its models from the 1980s. Four of the largest facilities operated by Cycle & Carriage will achieve the Green Mark certification by the Building and Construction Authority by the end of 2027, following efforts to improve their overall environmental performance. The multi-brand motor dealer has locations across Singapore, including in the Ubi industrial estate, Alexandra Road and Pandan Loop. The move is part of the motor groups$50 million investment to refurbish its premises to enhance customer experience, build up its sustainability credentials and make its retail infrastructure future-ready. In its press statement on Jan 6, Cycle & Carriage said the work, which started in 2023, will run until 2027. This includes upgrading customer lounges and installing solar panels and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The investment applies across the brands that Cycle & Carriage represents, including Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Ora and Maxus, as well as the three Stellantis-owned brands, Citroen, Peugeot and Leapmotor. Alpina, a German carmaker known for creating high-end sports cars based on BMWs, is officially part of BMW and relaunched as BMW Alpina – a standalone brand under the BMW Group. The brand logo was announced on Jan 2, marking the completion of BMWs acquisition that was announced in 2022. Few details are givenabout the cars that will eventually be branded as BMW Alpina models, other than promising that the vehicles will fulfil the most demanding expectations in terms of visuals, acoustics and feel. BMW also said that each car will be an exclusive object for connoisseurs in pursuit of the extraordinary, without compromises on performance, comfort and individuality. The move by BMW Group to bring Alpina under its wings is said to be influenced by the ongoing transition towards electrification and increasingly demanding regulations whichneedthe might of a larger carmaking group to address. Alpina had been an independent manufacturer for more than 50 years, producing a small number of cars each year through a cooperation with BMW. The cars are partly assembled in BMWs production lines before being finished at Alpinas workshops.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/motoring/sony-unveils-ev-volkswagens-retro-display-cycle-carriage-goes-green-bmws-new-luxury-brand

Held at the Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre until Jan 11, the event spans multiple levels. Most of the brands are situated on the fourth and sixth floors, while Chinese brand Ora occupies the ground-floor atrium. Smaller booths are located on the third floor. As with the event in 2025, Chinese manufacturers dominate. One senior automotive executive remarked to The Straits Times that the sheer volume of Chinese brands made the event feel like a trade fair in Guangzhou or something. BYDonce again sets the bar, both with its sophisticated stand design and line-up of new models. Its brawny high-end sport utility vehicle (SUV), the Denza B5, looks poised to give the Land Rover Defender a run for its money. The show also marks the debut of several new Chinese brands, including Hongqi, Nio and ICaur. However, just as significant as this influx ofnew playersis the response from familiar Japanese carmakers. Notably, Toyota, Lexus and Mazda have wheeled out attractive electric models that can take the fight to their Chinese counterparts. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz has gone the extra mile. Rather than restricting its display to models that it wants to sell, such as its new CLA-class, the star is the Concept AMG GT XX. Still caked in grime from its record-breaking endurance run at the Nardo track in southern Italy, the concept car showcases electric technology that will be translated to the next Mercedes-AMG GT. Getting close to the filthy electric endurance sports car before it is shipped back to Germany is, alone, a compelling reason to visit the show. Here are five cars that have caught the eyes of STs Motoring team. The BMW Skytop is an extremely limited two-seater sports car that was unveiled as a design study in 2024 before becoming a production model. The car on display is one of just 50 made, so the event may be the only chance to see it in person. The car takes inspiration from BMWs best roadsters, including the 507 and Z8. The mechanical underpinnings come from the M8 Competition, including the 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 with 625hp. The car belongs to Eurokars, the multi-brand motor dealership group which is a BMW dealer. With the pumped-up wheel arches and two-tone alloy wheels, the Honda Super-One looks like it has been souped up by a boyracer. According to ST assistant editor Toh Yong Chuan, Honda only just unveiled the car in prototype form at the Japan Mobility Show on Oct 29, making the show cars in Singapore among the first production units to be displayed in the world. Engineer and ST motoring contributor Shreejit Changaroth picks the car because it reminds him of the Honda City Turbo II, a 1980s hatchback nicknamed bulldog for its chunky looks. The pint-size hatchback is also the first electric Honda to be officially available through the brands agent. Lexus mid-sized executive express that rivals the BMW 5-series looks radically different from the current generation, which has been largely unchanged for many years. Strikingly beautiful and sleek, the new Lexus ES proves saloons are still relevant and desirable, says retired ST senior correspondent Christopher Tan. The car has not yet been approved for sale. In the coming months, it will be available in electric and petrol-hybrid forms and is estimated to cost between $380,000 and $400,000. Newcomer Hongqi is using the show to preview the E-HS9, a large electric SUV which ST photojournalist Chong Jun Liang describes as stately on the outside with more than a passing resemblance to the Rolls-Royce Cullinan. The interior looks similarly grand, with generous lashings of leather and wood. With an expected price of being just under $500,000, this puts the car more in the luxury end of the market than most other Chinese car brands. A compact electric hatch from Aion, the UT is roughly as big as the BYD Dolphin. Calling the Aion UT small and cheerful, Mr Tan says the hatchback epitomises what electrification should be about: sustainability. The car was launched in two forms – Standard, which has a smaller battery and a range of 335km, and Premium, which can travel up to 410km on a single charge with its bigger battery.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/motoring/5-cars-to-catch-at-the-singapore-motorshow

What started out as a neighbourhood coffee counter in Hong Kong now has seven locations in the territory, including the latest one launched in Tsim Sha Tsui five months ago. Itsentryinto Singapore is courtesy of the founders of Hong Kong-based group Leading Nation Hospitality, which debuted ramen restaurant Mashi No Mashi here in 2024 via its local franchise partner Authentic Bites Concepts. The 70-seat Elephant Grounds – with pet-friendly outdoor seating – takes over the spacepreviouslyvacated by Mashi No Mashi, which moved to Nankin Row in October2025. Like in Hong Kong, the space carries the same nature-inspired aesthetic, complete with stamped phrases on the wood panels such as No Bad Days and Coffee & Chill. The food menu here features the same signatures as in Hong Kong, along with exclusive items and vegetarian options. On weekdays, there are two menus – one for breakfast (8 to 11am), the other for all-day dining (from 11am). There is also a separate weekend brunch menu. Signatures such as the Mr Shakshuka ($20) with toasted sourdough, chorizo, feta and cilantro; all-day breakfast ($18); and Acai Yogurt Bowl ($18) are available across all the menus, along with pastries baked on site, coffee, tea and other beverages. Pastry highlights include the Bacon & Mustard Danish ($6), Croissant ($3.80) and Banana Bread ($6) – best paired with its house-blend coffee (from $4.50)directlysourced from Ijen Lestari, a farm in East Java. Other dishes to try include the vegetable-forward Mrs Shakshuka ($16) with tofu, pumpkin, zucchini, olives and spiced tomato salsa; Quinoa & Kale Salad ($18); Fish Fillet Sando ($22); and a Singapore-exclusive Chicken Parm sandwich ($20).For more carbs, there is a selection of pasta and donburi dishes too. Like the Acai Yogurt Bowl, the Morning Cereal ($14) features the Founders Granola, also made on-site with thick rolled oats, pecan, almond flakes, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, maple syrup and coconut oil. The granola is also sold separately at $15 for a 300g bag. There is more to come – with a dedicated merchandise corner selling tote bags, apparel and reusable tumblers, as well as the brands popular ice cream sandwiches. Speaking to The Straits Times from Hong Kong, Leading Nation Hospitalitys co-founder Kevin Poon, 44, highlights Singapores interesting cafe culture, along with his fondness for kaya toast and Milo Dinosaur – which he hopes will be incorporated into the menu here one day. Should the cafe prove successful here, he does not rule out expansion, and could also explore opportunities to bring other brands from his group into Singapore. Besides Mashi No Mashi, the group also operates other F&B concepts in Hong Kong such as the one-Michelin-starred Cristal Room by Ann-Sophie Pic, speakeasy The Diplomat and wagyu specialist Wagyumafia. Singapore marks Elephant Grounds second overseas outlet, following its international debut in Manila in 2019. It will next open in south Jakarta by the first quarter of 2026. Mr Poon says: We are always in discussion over what would work in Singapore. It is a tricky market as there is an abundance of choice. Over the years, we will update the menu with different items and look at how to reinvent ourselves. Elephant Grounds opens on Jan 10 at 01-04 Guoco Midtown, 124 Beach Road, from 8am to 8pm daily.

The US labour market remained stuck in what economists and policymakers have called a no hire, no fire mode.PHOTO: AFP","['US economy', 'Employment', 'Labour market']","WASHINGTON–US job growth slowed more than expected in December amid business caution about hiring because of import tariffs and rising artificial intelligence (AI) investment, but the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 per cent, supporting expectations that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchangedin January. Non-farm payrolls increased by 50,000 jobs in December after rising by a downwardly revised 56,000 in November, the Labour Departments Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) said on Jan 9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 60,000 jobs added after a previously reported 64,000 increase in November. The closely watched employment report suggested that the labour market remained stuck in what economists and policymakers have called a no hire, no fire mode. It also confirmedthatthe economy was in a jobless expansion. Economic growth and worker productivity surged in the third quarter, in part attributed to the AI spending boom. The labour market lost considerable momentum in 2025, largely blamed on President Donald Trumps aggressive trade and immigration policies, which economists and policymakers said reduced both demand for and supply of workers. The sharp moderation in job growth, however, started in 2024. The BLS has estimated that about 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the 12 months through March 2025 than previously reported. The agency will publish its payrolls benchmark revision in February 2026with the January employment report. The overcounting has been blamed on the birth-death model, which is used by the BLS to estimate how many jobs were gained or lost because of companies opening or closing in a given month. In December2025, the BLS said it would, starting in January2026, change the birth-death model by incorporating current sample information each month. Together with the December employment report, the BLS published annual revisions to the household survey data for the past five years. The unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey. The annual population control adjustments, normally incorporated with the January employment report, will be delayed. Novembers unemployment rate was revised down to 4.5 per cent from the previously reported 4.6 per cent. The median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists was for the jobless rate to have eased to 4.5 per cent in December. Some economists say low supply has prevented a sharp rise in the unemployment rate. They estimated that between 50,000 and 120,000 jobs need to be created each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The US central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent range in December, but officials indicated that they were likely to pause further reductions in borrowing costs for now to get a better sense of the economys direction. With factors like tariffs and AI preventing companies from hiring more workers, economists increasingly view the labour markets challenges as more structural than cyclical, which would make rate cuts less effective to stimulate job growth.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/us-job-growth-slows-in-december-unemployment-rate-eases-to-4-4
"Gold, Bitcoin and REITs: What investors should consider for their portfolios in 2026","Jan 09, 2026, 09:20 PM","Jan 09, 2026, 11:37 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ebdc66cb052bcf919e3839965bffe18821288fb7f4a2d63d6dff0528d46748d6,"Gold is highlighted as a safe haven asset, with gold prices rising to US$4,470 per ounce, and Bitcoin shows resilience amid uncertainty.PHOTO: REUTERS","['SGX', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'Investment']","SINGAPORE – Financial markets have had a volatile start to 2026, driven in part by heightened geopolitical tensions after the United Statescaptured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduroon Jan 3, and renewed headlines around US President Donald Trumps interest in acquiring Greenland. These developments mark a shift from 2025s market concerns, which were largely on US tariff policy and fiscal debt, and their potential impact on global growth. They also come as the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue lowering interest rates in 2026 after three cuts in 2025, though uncertainty remains over what the Feds next chairman, who is set to take over in May, will do. In view of these changing circumstances, investors taking steps to protect and optimise their portfolios for 2026 should consider these three asset classes to help navigate volatility: Golds role as a safe haven asset in investor portfolios in 2026 is expected to grow further after prices rose to record levels in 2025. Gold prices, now trading at around US$4,470 per ounce, are already up by around 3.5 per cent since the start of the year amid heightened geopolitical risk following Maduros capture. Mr Trumps unprecedented actions in Venezuela have disrupted the world order even further and created more geopolitical uncertainties, which augur well for safe havens like gold, said Mr Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC. While Venezuela on its own will not impact the global economic outlook meaningfully, what has happened there has led to questions about which other territories could be potential targets for Mr Trump. Theseinclude Iran, Greenland, Colombia, Mexico and Cuba. Its unclear if Mr Trump will follow through with his rhetoric and if his bark is worse than his bite, said Mr Menon. Over the longer term, the US move on Venezuela could weaken the global system of shared rules that countries rely on, said Mr Bertram Lai, CGS International Securities head of research. This could prompt China and other countries to speed up efforts to reduce their reliance on the US dollar, shifting more of their reserves into assets such as gold, he said. Bitcoin prices, which capped a year of gains in 2025 to close at around US$88,000, rose immediately after the US struck Venezuela, hitting levels above US$93,000 on Jan 6 before falling back to US$90,000 levels on Jan 9. What were seeing following the Venezuela developments is a market responding to geopolitical uncertainty with more selectivity, said Ms Gracie Lin, chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange OKX Singapore. Gold has moved higher, in line with its traditional role as a hedge, equities have remained relatively resilient, and Bitcoin has held up alongside them. This reflects how investors are increasingly using crypto as part of a broader hedging toolkit in a more fragmented macro environment. While retail sentiment remains cautious, larger and more sophisticated investors are adding risk in a measured way, Ms Lin noted. Capital flows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF have turned strongly positive at the start of 2026. BlackRocks iShares Bitcoin Trust saw inflows of US$287.4 million (S$370 million)in a single day on Jan 2, representing the largest daily haul in nearly three months, according to data from crypto exchange Independent Reserve (IR). That contributed to total net flows of US$471 million into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on the first trading day of the year, IR said. For longer-term holders, Bitcoins appeal continues to rest on its scarcity, decentralisation and role as a digital store of value, Ms Lin said. These attributes tend to support conviction during periods of uncertainty. Funds have been flowing back into Singapores stock market, where the central bank has taken deliberate steps to revive liquidity and investor interest. As the average value of securities traded daily rose 21 per cent in 2025 to nearly $1.5 billion – the highest level since 2010 – and with retail participation at a four-year high, investors can no longer afford to ignore the Singapore market, said Ms Carmen Lee, head of equity research at OCBC Group Research. Singapore Exchange-listed real estate investment trusts (REITs) could continue to offer opportunity, with real estate transaction activity and yields expected to stabilise under lower interest rates in 2026. Investment research firm Morningstar thinks Keppel REIT is undervalued for its high-quality office portfolio and best in class tenant base, and expects it to benefit from a tightening Singapore office market. Morningstar also likes Mapletree Industrial Trust for the REITs data centre portfolio, and management efforts to optimise its industrial property holdings. OCBC reckons gaining exposure to REITs with Singapore assets could be a prudent strategy, given the defensive nature of the sector, the resilience of local property values and favourable domestic funding conditions. It prefers the retail-sector REITs, saying landlords are able to charge higher rents on lease renewals and keep most of their space fully occupied. Its top picks are CapitaLand Ascendas REIT and CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, as well as Keppel DC REIT, Parkway Life REIT and OUE REIT.

Issued on Jan 9, the consultation paper sets out proposals to simplify the listing process in Singapore and bring it closer to US standards, making it easier for companies to pursue a dual listing on the Global Listing Board (GLB). First announced on Nov 19 as part of the MAS Equity Market Review Groups final recommendations to revive the local stock market, the GLB was designed to enable companies to simultaneously list and access growth capital across the US and Singapore. It is targeted to launch around the middle of 2026. MAS is proposing to allow a single set of offer documents for companies that want to list on both bourses by incorporating US prospectus disclosure requirements for initial public offerings (IPOs) and post-listing stages. Under current requirements, issuers prepare their prospectuses based on two sets of disclosure requirements. This incurs additional time and costs. MAS also proposes shortening the prospectus registration process to better align Singapores IPO timeline with that of the US. This change would allow the final prospectus in Singapore to be lodged and registered as soon as the US registration statement becomes effective. Current regulations require IPO prospectuses to be filed and made available to the public for at least seven days before registration can take place. The proposed change makes it easier for companies to coordinate their prospectus approval and fund-raising timelines in Singapore and the US. At the post-listing stage, MAS proposes the introduction of three safe harbours for GLB issuers, which are similar to those in the US: A safe harbour for forward-looking statements to protect companies and related parties from civil lawsuits, as long as the statements meet the same conditions used in the US and are not false or misleading; A share buyback safe harbour to protect companies and related buyers from criminal and civil liability if they follow US rules on how, when, at what price and how much they buy back shares; A pre-determined trading plan safe harbour granting defence to criminal and civil liabilities if a person complies with US regulations on insider trading. All issuers, not just GLB ones, could also be allowed to engage retail investors earlier in the IPO process, after lodging their preliminary prospectus with MAS. This aligns the timing of their engagement with retail investors more closely with US practice. Another MAS proposal would treat the company behind the underlying shares as the issuer and offeror of sponsored depositary receipts (DRs), instead of the bank that issues them. This would make that issuer responsible for prospectus registration, and liable for prospectus‑related misstatements or omissions under the Securities and Futures Act. A sponsored DR lets investors buy and sell shares of a foreign company on their local stock exchange without dealing with overseas markets. SGX RegCo listed out a set of requirements for GLB eligibility in its proposal. Issuers must have a market capitalisation of at least $2 billion, and be listed or accepted for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. In addition, they must either post a total revenue of at least US$90 million (S$115.6 million) in the latest completed financial year, or satisfy income or assets with equity requirements. They will be delisted from the GLB if they do not maintain their listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. A Singapore resident independent director or Singapore-based compliance adviser must also be appointed. To facilitate retail participation, they must allocate a minimum of 5 per cent or $50 million of their offering, whichever is less, to at least one designated retail brokerage in Singapore. This is currently not required for IPOs in the US. SGX RegCo will retain discretion over the admission and continued listing of securities on the GLB. Public consultation on the proposed amendments will close on Feb 8. Some industry insiders welcomed the move, although others noted that the changes, if carried out, hinge on the stock market continuing its current run. Mr David Gerald, chief executive of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), or Sias, said the proposed changes could bring the best of both markets to investors in Singapore, and noted that Sias would continue to play its role in helping to educate investors. But Mr Robson Lee, director at law firm Legal Solutions, noted that attracting new and large issuers to list on the GLB would depend on the Singapore market sustaining the upswing momentum seen since the second half of 2025. He added that an immediate challenge facing the GLB would be the availability of issue managers, underwriters and placement agents who are knowledgeable in the capital market requirements and practices in both the US and Singapore. There would also need to be requisite distribution and selling networks to competently conduct road shows and undertake the sale of the issuers securities. Mr Lee also noted that the safe harbour provisions, as currently drafted, are not aligned with US requirements, which could be a source of confusion and uncertainty. This could pose a challenge to how authorities in Singapore and the US determine if there has been a breach in regulations by the issuer, and how they would exercise prosecutorial discretion.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/mas-sgx-regco-take-steps-to-facilitate-dual-listings-on-sgx-nasdaq

Those measures are starting to have an impact, asIPOsin Singapore raised about US$2.15 billion (S$2.8 billion) in 2025, the most since 2017. Still, that compares with US$37.2 billion in Hong Kongs best performance since 2021, according to LSEG data. Having watched as Hong Kong experienced an artificial intelligence-fuelled IPO boom over the past two years, Singapore is banking on Nasdaqs cachet to help it regain ground and cement its role as a regional hub for growth companies seeking global capital. Welcoming the tie-up was Singapore-based Carro, backed bySingapores investment companyTemasek and Japanese tech investor SoftBank Group. The car marketplace is aiming for a US IPO with a valuation at over US$3 billion, Reuters has reported. Co-founder and chief executive Aaron Tan told Reuters: Our hesitation for a dual listing has always been complexity and the need to deal with two regulators during an IPO. Malaysia-based used-car trading platform Carsome described the initiative as constructive. Co-founder and CEO Eric Cheng said: A structure that streamlines cross-border listings will naturally prompt companies to reassess the options available to them. Singapore-based Funding Societies, a regional digital financing platform for small businesses, said the tie-up could offer South-east Asian start-ups a means of listing in the US, which might otherwise be out of reach. Mr Piers Ingram, the CEO of Singapore-based Hummingbird Bioscience, told Reuters that the initiative is a bridge, opening the way to science-focused investors in the US and Asia. All four companies declined to elaborate on any IPO plans. Branded the Global Listing Board, the initiative allows firms with a market value of at least $2 billion to prepare a single prospectus for SGX and Nasdaq with a coordinated review replacing two separate processes. By way of comparison, a secondary listing on Hong Kongs main board requires a valuation of at least HK$3 billion (S$495 million), along with sundry other conditions. The higher threshold reflects the quality of the companies that SGX and Nasdaq are targeting, but also limits prospective applicants to established growth firms, bankers said. About eight South-east Asian tech firms meet the threshold, with another two to three potentially close to achieving that, said Mr Roshan Raj, partner at RedSeer Strategy Consultants. The threshold is sizeable enough to support meaningful trading volumes and liquidity across both markets, said Mr Pol de Win, head of global sales and origination at SGX. Nasdaq vice-chairman Bob McCooey said the Global Listing Board will create meaningful value for the region and facilitate a global marketplace. While South-east Asian applicants would benefit from greater regional recognition in Singapore, the city-state will still have to persuade them to list in a market long characterised by thin liquidity, bankers said. Average daily turnover was about $1.39 billion in November compared with $29 billion in Hong Kong, the latest figures showed. Singapore has introduced measures to boost liquidity, such as establishing an almost $4 billion fund to support investment managers focusing on small- and mid-cap equities. The dual listing initiative is a positive step, but its broader impact will depend on early deal flow, liquidity support and whether the Singapore regulatory authorities subsequently relax thresholds, said Ms Tay Hwee Ling, capital markets services leader at Deloitte Southeast Asia. A Monetary Authority of Singapore spokesperson said the authority is working with SGX on a streamlined regulatory framework for those seeking to list on the Global Listing Board, while SGXs Mr de Win noted that success and transformation require industry-wide effort. SGX is working closely with the Singapore government agencies and market participants on a comprehensive approach that further strengthens supply, stimulates demand and builds a pro-business ecosystem with robust governance, he said.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/singapores-nasdaq-link-draws-interest-but-threshold-and-liquidity-may-limit-take-up
Chinas consumer inflation scales near 3-year high but deflation battle far from over,"Jan 09, 2026, 01:41 PM","Jan 09, 2026, 07:52 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/c17a5e6412dfe6f1f17c79e756d8490f6d36664943b740dc886766d07157d07b,Chinas consumer demand has remained a drag on confidence and growth for years amid a prolonged property crisis and a weak job market.ST PHOTO: AW CHENG WEI,"['China', 'Inflation/Price level', 'China economy']","BEIJING– Chinas annual consumer price inflation accelerated to a 34-month high in December, but the full-year rate slumped to its lowest in 16 years while producer deflation persisted, backing market expectations for more stimulus to shore up soft demand. Imbalances in Chinas economy have worsenedover the past year even as growth is on course to meet Beijings target of around 5 per cent for 2025, buoyed by policy support and resilient goods exports. US President Donald Trumps global trade war has added to persistently soft consumer demand, which has remained a drag on confidence and growth for years amid a prolonged property crisis and a weak job market. The December consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.8 per cent from the same month in 2024, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Jan 9, matching expectations in a Reuters poll and perking up from a 0.7 per cent increase in November. The rise was mainly driven by food prices, especially those of fresh vegetables and beef, NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said. Pre-New Year holiday shopping and supportive policies also helped boost consumer prices, she added. Chinese policymakers have repeatedly pledged to support a rebound in prices with monetary policy and cracked down on excessive competition. They have vowed to boost peoples income to unleash consumption potential and better align the countrys supply and demand. Yet, the underlying demand impulse in the economy remains weak. Despite expectations of a recovery, inflation remains relatively low and should not preclude further monetary easing in 2026, said Mr Lynn Song, INGs chief economist for Greater China. China economist at Capital Economics Huang Zichun said the elevated headline CPI was not owing to the government campaign to curb so-called involution, adding that overcapacity and deflationary pressures will persist in the coming years in the absence of stronger demand-side measures. Indeed, for the entire 2025, consumer price growth was flat, well below the around 2 per cent goal policymakers were aiming for, a sign that stimulus measures, such as a consumer goods trade-in scheme, have yielded only modest results in lifting sentiment and containing deflationary pressure. NBS data showed core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of food and fuel, rose 1.2 per cent year on year in December, unchanged from November. Goldman Sachs economists estimate that the core price gauge excluding gold prices edged down in December from the prior month. Annual growth in Chinas consumer prices has for years failed to meet policymakers targets as the economy struggled to recover from the pandemic. The producer price index (PPI) fell 1.9 per cent year on year in December, remaining in a deflationary funk for more than three years even as it eased from a 2.2 per cent drop in November. Ms Dong attributed the moderation in factory-gate deflation to both global commodity prices – including rising prices of non-ferrous metals – and policies for controlling capacity in key industries. Ms Huang, however, said there has not been any fundamental improvement in overcapacity. Prices of consumer durables continued to fall at a faster pace than during the depths of the global financial crisis, highlighting that the issue of excess supply remains unresolved in much of the manufacturing sector, she noted. For the whole of 2025, producer prices fell 2.6 per cent. Given the slowdown in economic momentum in the second half of 2025, the market is watching for signs of additional government support measures in 2026. The central government has allocated 62.5 billion yuan (S$11.5 billion) from special treasury bond proceeds to local governments to keep funding the consumer goods trade-in scheme in 2026. The government has pledged to use monetary policy tools flexibly, such as by cutting interest rates and banks reserve requirement ratio, to keep liquidity ample and spur growth.

The stock was priced at HK$165 apiece in an upsized offering, with retail investors subscribing to more than 1,830 times the shares available. The counter closed at HK$345 on Jan 9, 109 per cent higher than its IPO price. Backed by Alibaba Group Holding and Abu Dhabis sovereign wealth fund, MiniMax is among the first of Chinas post-ChatGPT generative AI firms to go public. The gains came after rival Knowledge Atlas Technology JSC, known as Zhipu, delivered a more modest debut in the financial hub on Jan 8. MiniMaxs first-day stock performance will serve as a litmus test for whether investor enthusiasm in Chinas AI sector – so far concentrated on hardware makers – can extend to software firms. Buoyed by localisation demand, chipmakers Moore Threads Technology and MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai surged multifold on their first day of trade, while chip designer Shanghai Biren Technology jumped 76 per cent in Hong Kong. In contrast, Zhipu closed 13 per cent higher. It is still early in the China AI investment cycle compared with global peers, so it may be difficult for investors to identify winners and losers, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Marvin Chen. Performance may begin to become more differentiated as the cycle matures. Founded in early 2022, Shanghai-based MiniMax has its roots in gaming. The start-up is trying to one-up DeepSeek and OpenAI with consumer chatbots at home and abroad. A devotee of the battle-arena game Dota 2, co-founder and chief executive officer Yan Junjie first noticed OpenAI in 2019, when its bots defeated the worlds top human players. Captivated, he devoured the labs research papers, prompting a career pivot from computer vision to natural language processing. He secured one of his first cheques from Genshin Impact studio Mihoyo, whose founders obsess over using AI to revolutionise gaming. Mihoyo remains a key client. The IPO prospectus shows the company posted an adjusted loss of about US$186 million in the first nine months of 2025. MiniMax joins a wave of Chinese AI firms that have rushed to raise funds to accelerate their expansion amid support from Beijing to bolster home-grown champions in the sector. About half of the 11 companies that have laid out plans to list in Hong Kong in January are AI firms.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/china-ai-firm-minimax-jumps-54-in-hong-kong-debut

South-east Asias largest bank held preliminary talks with funds investing in SRTs, according to people familiar with the matter. Preparations are at early stagesand specific transactions have not been discussed. Banks use SRTs as a way to insure loans against default. The transactions, which are often structured as credit-linked notes, allow lenders to boost their solvency ratios and reduce their reliance on less shareholder-friendly options like issuing new equity or cutting dividends. They also increase their leeway for new lending, acquisitions or shareholder payouts. A representative for DBS declined to comment. Acquisitions have been part of its growth strategy.

Can Manchester United escape the vicious rinse-and-repeat manager cycle?,"Jan 10, 2026, 06:00 AM","Jan 10, 2026, 06:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/06e81ec2fdaa7efbc35895aa16cccd93034732fecb435701674a6212ff7b8ef5,"Ruben Amorim may be the fall guy now, but if Manchester United do not address their structural issues, they risk spiralling further away from the top where they believe they still belong.PHOTO: EPA","['The Big Question', 'Manchester United', 'EPL', 'Ruben Amorim', 'Football matches']","SINGAPORE – Here we go, again. A new year, but the same Manchester United. The Red Devils are back in an all too familiar place, staring at the aftermath of another failed reset. On Dec 5, Uniteds official channels posted a 106-word statement. It bore a different name, but a similar script. A manager dismissed, a brief note of thanks, best wishes for the future, and an announcement that an interim solution – Darren Fletcher – has been put in place. After 14 months, it wasRuben Amorims last day at the storied club. For United fans, it was Groundhog Day. They have now gone through 10 managers, short-term and permanent, since Alex Fergusons retirement in 2013. This time, the dismissal did not come as a complete surprise. Less than 24 hours before, Amorim delivered what will now be remembered as his most startling press conference, where he urged the scouting department and sporting director to do their jobs. This latest upheaval has again left United fans and others wondering: Can the Red Devils get out of this rinse-and-repeat hell? Regardless of the press conference drama, most pundits agreed that Amorims departure was inevitable as they felt he was out of his depth. After being appointed in November 2024, he could lead United only to a 15th-place finish in the English Premier League, and they lost to fellow league strugglers Tottenham Hotspur (17th that season) in the Europa League final. In the ongoing season, United suffered a shock and embarrassing elimination in the second round of the League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby Town after a penalty shoot-out defeat. The numbers do not lie. With a record of 25 wins, 15 draws and 23 losses in 63 games, the 40-year-old has the lowest win rate of 38.1 per cent of the last six permanent United bosses. Dutchman Louis van Gaal was the next closest with a 52.4 winning percentage. Amorim also ranks at the bottom for points per Premier League game, with 1.23. Former United captain Gary Neville admitted he was surprised by the timing of the decision but not the call to remove Amorim from his post. When a manager is sacked, its a poor reflection on everybody. It means it has not worked, he told Sky Sports News. Former United striker Michael Owen said that on X that Uniteds board must be secretly happy that he has given them the perfect opportunity to part ways. Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher pulled no punches as he described Amorim as a barely competent Premier League manager, adding that hes not good enough to be Manchester Uniteds manager. However, former United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich had a differing view as he felt the club had made progress this season under Amorim, pointing to how they are two points off the top four and a guaranteed place in the Uefa Champions League, the target for this season. Bosnich, a 53-year-old former Australian international, told The Straits Times: I really am dumbfounded. From a results perspective, hes in sixth position compared to 15th the season before. That is progress. Ultimately, whether it was due to results, the tepid football – which saw United fans boo the team off the pitch at both half and full-time during the 1-1 draw with bottom side Wolverhampton Wanderers on Dec 30 – or the public display of frustration, the axe has fallen. But much of the responsibility for the current state of affairs rests with Uniteds decision-makers at the top, namely Ineos chairman and club minority owner Jim Ratcliffe, director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada. In a sardonic piece for The Guardian, Jonathan Liew wrote: If coaches were once chefs, they are now more akin to Deliveroo drivers: not really responsible for the food, but still ultimately answerable if it arrives cold or leaks out of the box. For all the unwanted records that Amorim holds, his dismissal was reportedly sparked mainly by him butting heads with Wilcox. The latter had issues with the coachs back-three system, despite hiring him with the knowledge that he is the 3-4-3 guy with no chance of compromise. Wilcox was not helped by comments he made at an event in September, when he talked about the difficulties he faced after ending his playing career. He said: I am a coach at heart. I am a coach inside even though I know I have a different job now. That is a strength in my role but it also causes me a bit of a problem because I always want to interfere in what the managers are doing. It is clear that he has interfered this time, and the problems at United run deeper than the system used on the pitch. Amorim may be the fall guy now, but if United do not address their structural issues, they risk spiralling further from the top where they think they still belong. Angered by how things have unfolded, Bosnich said that there needs to be more transparency about the role of the manager or head coach. He questioned: Is the manager just there to coach the team, because he (Amorim) alluded to that in that press conference, or is it the people behind the scenes making the decisions in terms of how hes going to play? Fans want transparency, to know what is going on at the moment. Former United midfielder Owen Hargreaves added: Everybody wants the best for the football club, but the problem is when you have a lot of cooks in the kitchen, a lot of people have different opinions. Ruben was employed to do his job and if he wants to play a certain way, you guys picked him to do that and let him get on with it. Bosnich also felt that it was unnecessary for minority owner Ratcliffe and Berrada to chime in with football opinions, along with Wilcox, without clear lines of delineation of responsibility. He added: Its okay to have a sporting director, whose job should be to look at things like the medium term, the long term and player recruitment, but it should be done in conjunction with the person that youve appointed (as manager), because he needs results immediately. The managers (or head coaches) are the ones putting their name and reputation on the line. So theyve got to be the one who has the final say on the overwhelming majority of things. There may be times when the sporting director says, After talking to the big boss, we cant afford that player, so youre going to have to give me other options. But its not up to him (the sporting director) to go and sign a player and say to the manager, Heres the player, make him better and play him, without the manager knowing anything. Its quite evident after whats happened in the last week, that there are things going on behind the scenes which are going against the grain of the football club achieving the best possible results. For those keeping count, Amorims departure marks the third major misstep by Ratcliffe and his leadership team since the British billionaire became co-owner and assumed control of football operations from the Glazer family in February 2024. First, it was former sporting director Dan Ashworths departure in December 2024, just five months after he took up the role at Old Trafford. Prior to that, United sacked ten Hag in October, just four months after extending the Dutchmans contract. But the most damning is the sacking of Amorim given that just a few months ago, Ratcliffe said that the Portuguese coach had three years to prove himself despite a tough start at United, adding that the club would not be drawn into knee-jerk reactions. Along with the latest, contradictory move, there has been little to suggest he can deliver on his desire to restore a club he admitted has become mediocre to their former glory. For Ratcliffe to take United back towards their former perch, clarity of vision is essential and so is the courage to stay the course when the going gets tough. Other than fixing themselves internally, there remains the task of finding Amorims long-term replacement. The talk is that United are set to appoint an interim coach until the end of the season. In doing so, United may be writing off another season. How invested will players be in a coach they know is temporary? And if short-term success follows, does the hierarchy fall back into the same trap of rewarding sentiment over strategy, as it did with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019? Bosnich noted that with United looking to go with a caretaker option until the end of the season, it appears that they could be interested in someone who will be involved at the World Cup. Thomas Tuchel, contracted to England till the end of the World Cup, and Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann are thought to be among the top candidates for a permanent role at United in the summer. But if a new head coach is appointed only after the World Cup concludes on July 26, little more than a month before the new season begins, preparation time will be severely limited. That would leave minimal scope for shaping pre-season, influencing recruitment, or properly embedding tactical ideas, once again forcing United into reactive rather than strategic planning. Bosnich, who noted that Fletcher will be absolutely fine as an interim coach, added that the possible appointments of Solskjaer and Michael Carrick would also be acceptable, though he is rooting for former England manager Gareth Southgate. Noting that European qualification is within grasp, he said: If the chance comes that Southgate is available to take it now, I would snap it up. I am biased because hes a friend and ex-teammate. I would go for him based on what he did with England, taking them from basically an all-time low to semi-final, quarter-final in consecutive World Cups and two European finals in a job that is highly pressurised. He manages very well up and down. Hes very astute and he also has a very good way with people, and I think thats very important. Neville meanwhile said the experiments have got to stop… United must take risks and have the courage to play attacking, aggressive football, arguing that the club need a manager aligned with their traditional style of attacking football and not a stop-gap or mismatched coach. Regardless of who they appoint, Bosnich stressed that United are accountable and answerable not just to shareholders, but also supporters. He added: Fans can do without football, but football cannot do without its fans. Regardless of dividends and share price, your ultimate measurement is the satisfaction of your fans. Because if that stops, then there is a big problem.",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/can-manchester-united-escape-the-vicious-rinse-and-repeat-manager-cycle

Ismael Saibari was also on target in another workmanlike display in which Morocco were efficient enough, but also created little in the way of chances, netting from two of their three shots on target. Cameroon had a strong shout for a penalty in the second half after what looked like a foul on Bryan Mbeumo but they too battled in the final third and did not force home goalkeeper Yassine Bounou into a save in the 90 minutes. Morocco, who have yet to concede a goal in open play at the finals, face the winner of the Jan 10 third quarter-final between Algeria and Nigeria in the next round, a tie that will be played in Rabat on Jan 14. The hosts took the lead in the 26th minute via the prolific Diaz as the Real Madrid player showed his scoring instinct. Achraf Hakimis corner was headed goalwards by Ayoub El Kaabi and Diaz deflected the ball in from close range. He has now scored in each of Moroccos five games and extends his own record for most goals by a Moroccan at a single Cup of Nations finals, but left the field late on with a heavily strapped thigh that will be a concern for coach Walid Regragui. Chances were hard to come by for both sides, but Abde Ezzalzouli headed narrowly over the crossbar from another Hakimi corner, while the latter laid on a headed chance for Saibari that was spurned. Cameroon were unfortunate not to get a penalty kick when Mbeumo was caught in the box as Mauritanian referee Dahane Beida waved play on, while Georges-Kevin Nkoudou headed wide at the back post with the Indomitable Lions best chance of the game. Morocco made it 2-0 minutes later to kill off the contest when Saibari was left unmarked at the back post and had time to control the ball and fire low into the far corner of the net. Iliman Ndiaye scored the only goal as Senegal booked a semi-final berth at the Africa Cup of Nations for the third time in the last four tournaments, beating 10-man Mali 1-0 in the last eight on Friday. In Tangiers, Iliman Ndiaye scored the only goal as Senegal booked a semi-final berth for the third time in the last four tournaments, beating 10-man Mali 1-0.

Mali were reduced to 10 men for the second half after captain Yves Bissouma was sent off for a second caution on the stroke of halftime. He was booked first for a clumsy challenge in the 25th minute and was dismissed after a needless foul on Idrissa Gana Gueye.

Fae, 41, was a key player in Ivory Coasts run to the final, which ended in a penalty shootout defeat by Egypt, a result that secured their first title of three as they dominated African football from 2006 to 2010. Egypt have not won the trophy since, losing finals in 2017 and 2021, while Fae led Ivory Coast to the title at the 2023 edition after being appointed interim coach following the dismissal of Jean-Louis Gasset. Egypt absorbs pressure, they dont control (games), its about disrupting the opponent and, whenever they get a chance, punishing them, Fae told reporters on Friday. We were watching Egypt, but you could put the images from 2006 back on and it would be exactly the same. This is exactly the Egypt I expected, an Egypt that always seems to be in difficulty, that looks like its about to crack, but almost never does, he added. Egypt needed extra time to overcome Benin 3-1 in the last 16, while the title holders crushed Burkina Faso 3-0, with Manchester Uniteds Amad Diallo shining. However, Fae was fully aware of the attacking threat posed by the seven-time champions, who include Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah and Manchester City winger Omar Marmoush. They are a complete team, solid defensively and dangerous offensively... You should never be overconfident against Egypt. If you arrive overconfident, you have no chance, he said.

Nigel Dewale with an address at Prospect Street, Great Harwood, north-west England, entered a guilty plea to one charge of malicious communications and possession of a weapon in a private place at Blackburn Magistrates Court on Jan 9. His admission came after the UK Football Policing Unit launched an investigation in July 2025 into abuse directed at Carter. Dewale is due to be sentenced on March 25. Mark Roberts, the football policing lead for the National Police Chiefs Council, said: Everyone is responsible for what they do and say, and posting a message on social media is no different. In this case, Dewale sent hateful and malicious messages, thinking that he would be able to hide behind his account name. His comments were totally abhorrent, they caused emotional distress for Miss Carter and her family and I welcome the guilty plea entered today. A spokesperson for Englands governing Football Association responded to Dewales guilty plea by saying unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated, whether in person or online. The spokesperson added: Our priority remains supporting Jess and all of our England players who continue to be impacted by disgusting online abuse. Writing on her social media accounts at the time the abuse came to light, Carter – who went on to help England win a second successive Euros title – said: From the start of the tournament, I have experienced a lot of racial abuse. Whilst I feel every fan is entitled to their opinion on performance and result I dont agree or think its OK to target someones appearance or race. England forward Lauren James suffered online racist abuse after a defeat for her club side Chelsea in 2023. England mens players Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho were targeted after they all failed to score penalties in a shoot-out loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final at Londons Wembley Stadium.

REUTERS/Yara Nardi","['Hockey', 'Olympics', 'Italy']","MILAN, Jan 9 - The Santagiulia ice hockey arena in Milan, which will stage some of the biggest matches at the Winter Olympics next month, finally opened its doors to the public on Friday with a test event featuring Italys top teams. Slow progress on completing the venue has emerged as the main headache in the run-up to the Olympics which will be co-hosted by Milan and Cortina dAmpezzo from February 6-22. The arena, which will have a capacity of 15,300 spectators, will host 4,000 fans during the test days, the organisers said, acknowledging there is still work to do, including completing hospitality areas. The most important part of the test event for us is to try everything related to the competition field, Chief Games Operations Andrea Francisi said. The goal of these three days is to understand whether what we have put in place for the competitions works, he added. This weekend it is hosting the Final Four event of Italys Championship and the 2025/2026 Italian Cup in what will be a chance to evaluate the quality of the ice itself, as well as facilities for spectators. Ice hockey will be one of the main events of the Games, with players from the North Americas elite National Hockey League set to feature. Local organisers said last month that the rink will be safe after it emerged that the surface will be a little shorter than NHL specifications, raising concerns over the risk of even more high-speed collisions between players. IOC Sport Director Pierre Ducrey said the difference in size compared with NHL standards was marginal and the rink fully met requirements. We are happy with the size, we are happy with the ice, Ducrey said, adding that there will be refinements after the test event, well look at the results, debrief and improve so we are ready for the first kick off. Located in the south-east of Milan, it is one of two ice hockey venues for the Games, and is scheduled to host the gold medal games. After the Games, it will be converted into a centre to host sports and live entertainment. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/delayed-milan-ice-hockey-venue-finally-opens-its-doors
Endrick aims to reboot career with Lyon ahead of World Cup,"Jan 10, 2026, 03:31 AM","Jan 10, 2026, 03:31 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e704f6aefc8d300ae8bd79f70ac46f53221d5d9b243935c923483cc79e216c9d,"Soccer Football - Champions League - Quarter Final - Second Leg - Real Madrid v Arsenal - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - April 16, 2025 Real Madrids Endrick applauds fans after the match REUTERS/Susana Vera","['World Cup', 'Brazil', 'Europa League']","Jan 9 - Brazilian teenager Endrick aims to reboot his club career and stake a claim for Brazils 2026 World Cup squad as he prepares for his competitive debut with Olympique Lyonnais on Sunday against Lille in the French Cup. The 19-year-old forward, on loan from Real Madrid until the end of the season, is eager to showcase his potential after struggling for game time at the Santiago Bernabeu under coach Xabi Alonso. Leaving the biggest club in the world, where everyone dreams of playing, would be difficult for anyone, but Im not leaving. Its just a break, Endrick told Reuters in an interview on Friday. (At Lyon) Ill finally be able to play a series of matches and that will also benefit Real Madrid. Lyons interest helped a lot - they have everything I was looking for: the squad, the fans, the coaching staff and the opportunity to grow. Real paid more than 60 million euros to sign a striker who was widely regarded as a generational talent at 16 from Sao Paulo-based Palmeiras in 2022, but he had to wait until he turned 18 to join the Spanish side due to FIFA regulations on underage players. From the impoverished slums of the capital Brasilia, Endrick helped Palmeiras to a record-extending 12th Brazilian league title and became Brazils youngest international since Pele in 1957. Endrick also became the youngest player to score in an international game at Wembley in March 2024, with his goal giving Brazil a 1-0 victory over England that ended the home sides 21-game unbeaten streak at the national stadium. He joined Real on a six-year deal in July 2024 and in his first season under then-coach Carlo Ancelotti, Endrick netted seven goals in 37 appearances, largely as a substitute. However, a muscle injury at the start of the 2025-26 campaign and limited opportunities curtailed his momentum under new manager Alonso, with just two substitute appearances and one start in the Copa del Rey. The loan move to Lyon was designed to provide Endrick with regular minutes and a fresh platform. I arrived when I was just 18, and I scored on my debut in every tournament. A lot happened faster than many expected. I understand that people want me to play more, but I realise its not always going to happen that quickly - especially coming back from an injury, Endrick said. With the World Cup just a few months away, Endrick said Brazil coach Ancelotti gave him instructions on what he could and needed to do to improve and that his advice was to leave Real and earn more playing time in a place he could be happy. He said that Alonso told him something similar and that he took both coaches advice on board. Ancelotti and Xabi (Alonso) advised me to seek playing time after I recovered from injury. They are two champions with winning careers. Theyve been through it all. Victories, defeats, injuries, titles... You have to listen to advice from people like that, Endrick said. Lyon are fifth in the Ligue 1 standings on 30 points, 10 behind leaders RC Lens and nine from second-placed Paris St Germain. They are top in the Europa League standings and will play at Lens in the French Cup on Sunday for a spot in the quarter-finals.

Ndiaye netted after 27 minutes, taking advantage of a goalkeeping howler to put Senegal ahead in a tense quarter-final against their west African neighbours. Mali were reduced to 10 men for the second half after captain Yves Bissouma was sent off for a second caution on the stroke of halftime. He was booked first for a clumsy challenge in the 25th minute and was dismissed after a needless foul on Idrissa Gana Gueye. Mali were down to 10 men from the 26th minute of their previous clash against Tunisia and still managed to squeeze through on penalties but there was no recovery this time around against a polished Senegalese outfit. Ndiaye started the move that led to his goal with a run down the right wing, passing to wing back Krepin Diatta who then squared into the penalty area. Mali goalkeeper Djigui Diarra looked to have cut off the effort but the ball slipped from his grasp and squeezed under his body. Ndiaye was quickest to snap up the loose ball and finished from close-in. Diarra more than made up for his horror error, however, with a series of fine second-half stops to deny Senegal a bigger advantage as a gallant Mali battled away to get back into the contest. MALI GOALKEEPER MADE KEY STOPS Diarra made excellent diving saves and palmed away stinging shots to deny Idrissa Gana Gueye, Sadio Mane and substitutes Pathe Ciss and Lamine Camara. Mali had a handful of half-chances in the second half but were mainly on the back foot with hard-working striker Lassine Sinayoko an outlet for a rare counter-attack, which kept Edouard Mendy in Senegals goal on his toes. It was not an easy match because we played against a very talented Mali team but we achieved our objective, said Senegal coach Pape Bouna Thiaw. If we had been more clinical in front of goal we could have scored more goals but what is more important today is for us to have qualified for the semi-final. His Mali counterpart Tom Saintfiet paid tribute to his side. It was a difficult match for us because we had to play large parts of the game with 10 men. But that doesnt take away the fact that my players played gallantly and played very well, he said. Senegal will take on the winner of Saturdays clash between Egypt and defending champions Ivory Coast. Hosts Morocco were playing Cameroon in the second of the quarter-final clashes later on Friday.

The comments followed a first-round match at an ITF W35 event in Kenya that went viral after wildcard Hajar Abdelkader lost 6-0 6-0 in 37 minutes, committing 20 double faults and appearing unfamiliar with basic elements of the game, prompting organisers to say the wildcard should not have been granted. As the Tournament Operator and National Association, Tennis Kenya had understood that Ms Abdelkader was of an appropriate standard to compete. The outcome showed this was clearly not the case and was unacceptable for a World Tennis Tour event, along with being unfortunate for the player, an ITF spokesperson said. We acknowledge proportionate measures must be taken to prevent this happening again. We are exploring ways to ensure that, by assessing the process of awarding wildcards with consideration to a minimum playing standards requirement to compete at a WTT event. The WTT provides competitive opportunities for nearly 11,000 players each year across more than 1,250 events in more than 75 countries, serving as the main pathway to the top levels of the sport, with entry-level tournaments still offering prize money and ranking points.

The matches between St Pauli and RB Leipzig and Werder Bremen against Hoffenheim on Sunday were postponed due to the weather conditions. Germany has been hit by heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures in recent days with more expected over the weekend, while Britain has been plunged into a deep freeze by Storm Goretti. The stadium operator of St Paulis Millerntor Stadium closed the venue after consulting with local authorities, Germanys football league said in a statement on Friday. This is due to the large amount of snow and ice across the entire stadium grounds and the associated safety risks for everyone involved on match day, as well as the critical overall situation in Hamburg. A new date for the match will be announced shortly, the club said. It was a similar case in Bremen. There have been concerns that other matches, including Union Berlin against Mainz 05, could also be adversely affected by the weather as the Bundesliga season restarts this weekend after a three-week winter break. Salford Citys third-round FA Cup tie at home to Swindon Town on Saturday was postponed due to freezing conditions. Sheets have remained on the pitch over the last couple of weeks in anticipation of the forecasted sub-zero temperatures, and heat lamps have been moved around the pitch throughout the week to try and help thaw the pitch out, Salford City said in a statement. However despite the best efforts of the ground staff there are still parts of the pitch that are frozen, and the decision has been made early in conjunction with the FA and Swindon to prevent unnecessary disruption to travelling supporters. Three League Two (fourth tier) matches scheduled for Saturday, at Oldham Athletic, Chesterfield and Accrington Stanley, have also been postponed.
