Concert outfit picks for 2026,"Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/87a3dc87fd965575768d1a78b8095f790130fcc244b082cf04457f31997c7934,Here is a handy guide on how you can come up with outfits for upcoming concerts.ST PHOTOS: CHONG JUN LIANG,"['TL;DR', 'Concerts', 'Music']","If 2025 was the year for music lovers, with a string of A-list music artists taking fans on full sartorial expeditions in the little red dot, this year promises more music experiences. Beyond practising your fastest fingers first to buy tickets and the frantic last-minute cramming of the set list, another absolute necessity when preparing for a concert – planning your concert outfit. While looking your best and pulling off a trendy and visually appealing aesthetic is important, you should aim to strike a balance between style and practicality. This ensures that your concert experience is not just fun, but comfortable. To start off, find out more about each artists aesthetics – whether it is the eye-catching pastels of SEVENTEEN, or the folksy cottagecore aesthetic of The Lumineers – to base your outfit on. Opt for breathable fabrics, like cotton or linen, and steer clear of fabrics that trap heat such as nylon or polyester, which can stifle you after a few hours of singing your heart out in Singapores sweltering heat. Comfortable shoes are also a must, along with accessories which do not get in your way when youre weaving through the crowds or dancing to the beat. Most importantly, prioritise comfort over dressing for the gram. Dress for Singapores outdoor weather: light layers, tank tops, breathable fabrics. A well-planned outfit could make – or break – your concert experience. Here are five upcoming concerts in 2026 you may be interested in, along with inspirational outfits that fit each artists unique vibe. Ho! Hey! Its time to start searching for your outfit for The Lumineers, who perform at Fort Canning Green on Jan 24, making Singapore their first Asian stop in their Automatic World Tour. When crafting your concert-fit, lean into their rustic and indie-folk aesthetic, as you immerse yourself in the world of this American alternative-folk band - think earthy tones mixed with a vintage, boho edge. For a concert that feels like a warm autumn breeze wrapped in nostalgia, boys can opt for a flannel shirt over a loose cotton tee. Girls, on the other hand, can try a denim skirt with any top in warm earth tones, as well as accessories like a funky belt or a bandana to nail that mellow, wild-and-free Bohemian look. Some Flowers In Your Hair could also complete your outfit, to embrace the concert spirit. The Canadian trio is bringing their Equus tour to Singapore at The Star Theatre on Jan 26. Look forward to a dreamy and chill concert, as this indie pop band serenades you with their charming vocals and instrumentals. Let us show you how to curate a no-fuss concert outfit which feels elevated yet snug. Listening to Men I Trust feels like a dreamy evening scene; the tenderness and vulnerability of each of their songs calls for a light-hearted fit. Think airy silhouettes and muted warm tones. Girls can go for any basic top with intricate details on it to create a simple but elevated style. Boys can opt for a quarter zip-up and a loosely fitted pair of jeans to showcase understatement. We also recommend wearing minimal accessories: a small shoulder or tote bag, wired headphones, and a simple necklace will do the trick and turn heads. Whether you are in your 20s or your teenage years, R&B singer-songwriter GIVĒON somehow always manages to tug at the heartstrings with his smooth, melting ballads. Dear Beloved, The Tour, marks the singers first-ever performance in the Little Red Dot, featuring tracks from his sophomore album, BELOVED. For your outfit, tailored pants, a sleek leather jacket, loafers, clean lines, all in warm and neutral tones, encapsulate the vibe of the singers repertoire. Meanwhile, the silhouette stays sharp, but soft, just like his vocals. The concert will take place at The Star Theatre, on Feb 9, just in time to cry your heart out while watching couples gear up for Valentines Day. It may just be a Heartbreak Anniversary. Get VERY NICE with pastel pops, chequered prints, and a K-pop style that channels SEVENTEENs unmistakable charm. As the band celebrates its 10th anniversary, it is set to embark on its long-awaited SEVENTEEN WORLD TOUR. They will take the stage at the National Stadium on March 7, with fans and band members alike dressed in their best as they anticipate a night of spectacular performances, artistic choreography, and picture-perfect visuals. So, step back into your teenage and carefree years, and dont forget your biass photocard and Carat Bong light stick to complete the look. Guess whos back in the neighbourhood? Fans of indie-alternative band The Neighbourhood are rushing to their 2026 concert in Singapore after a hiatus of three years. NBHDs dark, alternative style is key to the bands aesthetic if youre wondering about the best outfit to wear and feel the Sweater Weather. We recommend wearing darker colours and going for a monochromatic style to match the bands edgy tones-simple clothing like grey jackets and black or white tops bring out the grungy low-key vibe of the bands music. Its a great way to look effortlessly stylish. If you plan to wear jewellery, plain, silver accessories pair best with the neutral colour scheme. When dressing for The Neighbourhood, whose THE WORLD TOUR stop in Singapore will be on July 14 at The Star Theatre, let the attitude do the talking. With these artists lighting up the different venues this coming year, make sure to bring your A-game by showing up as your most dazzling self, and make your concert experience the adventure of a lifetime. Now that you have your outfits sorted, dont forget the other essentials you might need for the concert. Here are some tips: Always bring a portable charger to ensure your device can last throughout the night, since taking videos can drain your battery faster than singing Heartbreak Anniversary. Remember to print out your tickets or make sure that your e-ticket is readily available on your phone to ensure maximum efficiency in getting through the line. Have a water bottle and portable fan to keep hydrated and cool for long waits. Lastly, for those who have sensitive ears or are seated near the loudspeakers, dont forget your earplugs. Though these items may seem simple, they are essential in ensuring a safe and enjoyable concert experience. Pack these items in your bag the day before the concert to avoid any last-minute frenzy on the day itself.

SFA stops sale of 5 batches of Nestle infant formula due to possible presence of toxin,"Jan 08, 2026, 10:35 PM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:59 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/399ad41a0d63163336f7015f8d4fe8543bd4f3319cef5ef9f43b8836ba688d76,"Swiss food giant Nestle announced on Jan 5 a recall of batches of infant formula in several European countries, and later extended the recall to other regions.PHOTO: AFP","['SFA/Singapore Food Agency', 'Food hygiene/safety', 'Communicable Diseases Agency']","SINGAPORE – The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has ordered a stop to the sale of five batches of Nestles infant and follow-on formulas as a precaution while checking for the presence of cereulide toxin. The order will remain in place while investigations are carried out, said SFA and the Communicable Diseases Agency in a joint statement late on Jan 8. Consumers who have bought the affected products are advised not to feed them to children, the statement added. Those whose children have consumed the products and are unwell should seek medical advice promptly. Consumers can contact their point of purchase if they have questions about the products. The European Commission Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed issued a notification about the infant formulas on Jan 7 and the International Food Safety Authorities Network did the same on Jan 8. The affected products are all from Switzerland. They are: NAN HA 3 SupremePro 800g, Batch 53030017C1 NAN HA 2 SupremePro 800g, Batch 51420017C4 NAN HA 1 SupremePro 800g, Batch 51460017C2 NAN HA 1 SupremePro 800g, Batch 51470017C1 NAN HA 3 SupremePro 32g, Batch 53030017B1 Cereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of theBacillus cereusbacterium, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea, the statement said. It added: The symptoms, which typically appear between 30 minutes and six hours from consumption of an affected food item, will usually resolve within 24 hours. Vulnerable populations such as infants and immunocompromised persons are at higher risk of complications. There are no international standards on the acceptable level for cereulide toxin in infant formula and other food. So far, there are no confirmed cases of illness linked to consumption of the affected Nestle infant formula in Singapore, the statement said. The Communicable Diseases Agency is working closely with SFA and is conducting surveillance together with hospitals to monitor for potential cases of cereulide poisoning in children, it added. Nestle on Jan 5 said it was issuing arecall of batches of infant formulain several European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Sweden. The recall was taken as a precaution after the Swiss food giant said it detected a quality issue in an ingredient sourced from one of its major suppliers. On Jan 8, therecall was extended to Africa, the Americas and Asia. At least 37 countries have issued health warnings over the infant formulas, likely linked to contamination. So far, there have been no reports of anyone falling ill in these countries. Nestle said it has recalled batches of SMA, BEBA, NAN and Alfamino formula because of possible contamination with cereulide. In response to queries from The Straits Times, Nestle Singapore earlier on Jan 8 said no stocks were being recalled in Singapore. It added that after a thorough check on all stocks, only two batches of products needed additional review. Further lab testing found that these and all other products sold by Nestle Singapore were safe for consumption, it said. It added that it was working with SFA to provide full visibility on the situation.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/halt-to-sales-of-5-batches-of-nestle-infant-formula-sfa

Mr Piara Singh was a semi-retired heavy transport operator and father of two, said his son Roheed Raj Singh, 32. The victims colleague told the family that Mr Piara Singh was on his way home to Bukit Batok after picking up medicine from the National University Hospital when he met with the fatal accident, his son added. The accident involving two prime movers happened near the Clementi Avenue 2 exit, in the direction towards Tuas. Mr Piara Singhs daughter Reesha Kaur, 28, said: We hope that drivers travelling in that area between 5.30pm and 5.45pm who might have dashcam footage will come forward. She added that her family is worried that if footage of the accident is not retrieved soon, it will be recorded over or deleted – which is how dashcam cameras usually operate. One of the two prime movers involved in the accident is believed to be in Malaysia now, she added. Mr Roheed Singh said he first learnt about the accident when his cousins sent him video footage of the crash being circulated on messaging platform WhatsApp. When he watched it, he noticed that the motorcycle in the crash sported red livery and gold rims, just like his fathers did. He said: I was in a state of shock, I was hoping it wasnt him. The siblings and their mother rushed back to see if their father had made it home, and called out for him, but he was not there, said Mr Roheed Singh. It was only later when a police officer got in touch with them that they found out that their father was in a fatal accident. Ms Kaur said her father was excited about her upcoming wedding, and was helping her with preparations. He was supposed to walk me down the aisle, she said. Our father was a loving, humorous man who brought joy to those around him. Mr Piara Singh rode a motorcycle for more than 40 years. His daughter said: He was a very selfless man who cared a lot about others... He was known as the life of the party. The family has put out an appeal for dashcam footage on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Ms Kaur said: At this point, investigations are ongoing, and the police have indicated that there is insufficient conclusive evidence to establish exactly how the accident occurred. They have identified the vehicles involved, but added that additional footage, particularly from vehicles coming from behind, would be helpful in clarifying the sequence of events. She added that the family would be grateful if anyone came forward with information or video footage of the accident.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/family-of-61-year-old-motorcyclist-killed-in-hit-and-run-on-aye-seeks-eyewitnesses-dashcam-footage
ERA Realty Network issued a Letter of Censure for supervisory lapses,"Jan 08, 2026, 08:10 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 09:27 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/3d633cf0b9b877aa136065a7530f3d4101fa67a279a56666052f5616e0eacc70,This is the first time a property agency ranked among the top five in terms of headcount has been censured.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI,"['Property market/sector', 'CEA/Council for Estate Agencies', 'Singapore property']","SINGAPORE –ERA Realty Network (ERA), the second-largest real estate agent in Singapore by headcount,has been issued a Letter of Censure (LOC) by the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) for failing to adequately manage and supervise its real estate salespeople. This is the first time a property agency ranked among the top five in terms of headcount has been censured. One of ERAs salespeople, Mr Abel Ang Pei Xiong, had been the subject of multiple complaints submitted to CEA for posting inaccurate information in his advertisement listings. The LOC does not carry a financial penalty against ERA. An LOC is issued for breaches that are assessed to be less serious to be referred to a CEA disciplinary committee. Some key considerations in assessing whether a breach is less serious include whether there is any financial loss to parties involved in the transaction, or if the errant salesperson or estate agent has any wrongful gain. Under the LOC framework, CEA is empowered to issue LOCs and impose financial penalties of up to $5,000 per case for less serious disciplinary breaches by real estate agencies and salespeople. CEAs LOC for ERA follows repeated instances where the agencys internal controls did not prevent or respond appropriately to its salespeoples regulatory lapses. In an article published on its website on Jan 8, CEA said the LOC stems from three breaches under the Code of Practice for Estate Agents (COPEA). CEAs action centres on supervisory failures involving Mr Ang. CEA said it had received multiple complaints against himfor advertisement-related breaches, such as posting ads that contained inaccurate pricing and misleading or inaccurate information on the property listed. ERA was advised in March 2022 to vet Mr Angs ad listings for accuracy before they are posted, as it has a responsibility to do so under the COPEA. In 2023, Mr Ang was fined $14,000 and suspended for five months from October 2023 to March 2024 by a CEA disciplinary committee for publishing property ads containing inaccurate and misleading information. CEA noted that Mr Ang continued with the same offences even after his suspension. In October 2025, he was fined $28,000 and suspended for six months. The article noted that ERA had two more lapses, including inadequate systems for managing and supervising its suspended salespeople. In January 2024, during Mr Angs suspension period, his profile was still active on ERAs portal, FindPropertyAgent.sg, alongside the profiles of two other suspended salespersons. The other two salespersons were not identified and CEA did not say what breaches they had committed. The Straits Times has contacted CEA for more information. There were no processes in place to ensure the removal of the profiles of suspended real estate salespersons from ERAs portal during their suspension period, said CEA on its website. ERA also did not have a system in place at that time to track whether suspended real estate salespeople returned their estate agent cards, and there was no standard process in place to deal with those who failed to do so, CEA added. CEA said these events showed that ERA had failed to meet its obligation under the COPEA to manage and supervise its real estate salespeople. ERA was also issued composition notices for associating with suspended salespeople when they were not registered. In reply to STs queries, ERA said two of the salespeople are registered with the company. They have been reminded and are fully committed to complying with their regulatory obligations, it said. One salesperson is currently serving a suspension. We will assess his case after the suspension has been fully served and will only allow him to be registered with ERA if he is fully committed to complying with his regulatory obligations. According to the CEA public register, ERA is the second-largest real estate agent in Singapore with 8,469 registered agents as at Jan 8, after PropNex, which has 14,020 agents. Mr Eugene Lim, key executive officer of ERA Singapore, said: The issues identified relate to process enhancements in the management and supervision of suspended salespersons, rather than to consumer harm. During the suspension period, the profiles of suspended salespersons remained visible on our public portal due to technical delays in the execution of profile deactivation procedures following suspension. Mr Lim added that the suspended salesperson was notified to return his estate agent card in accordance with existing procedures, and enhancements to tracking and escalation processes have since been identified to ensure more timely recovery. We acknowledge that we could have done better, and we take responsibility for addressing these gaps. We view this as an important learning point – not just for ERA but for the wider industry – and hope it contributes to stronger supervisory practices across agencies, he said. If real estate agencies and salespeople continue to commit less serious breaches repeatedly, CEA may impose a higher financial penalty together with an LOC, or refer the case to a disciplinary committee, depending on the number of repeated breaches committed and the facts and circumstances of the case. On Feb 21, 2024, property agent Tay Jin Yao was fined $15,000 and suspended for nine months for breaches including forgery and failing to perform the required customer due diligence. Mr Tan pleaded guilty to the offences, which included miscalculating the estimated cash proceeds in the sale of his clients Housing Board flat, and forging their signatures on forms. In 2023, property agent Ng Ni Ni was convicted by a CEA disciplinary committee for facilitating an HDB flat rental transaction that breached HDBs minimum occupation period rules, among other breaches.Ms Ng was fined $4,000 and given a five-month suspension.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/era-realty-network-issued-a-letter-of-censure-for-supervisory-lapses

This includes accused persons and victims of crime, who may have conditions such as psychosis, schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disabilities, among others. On Jan 8, the Ministry of Law said the Inclusive Justice Taskforce will examine the entire criminal justice process, from the pre-offending stage and criminal investigations to court processes, sentencing and post-sentencing support measures. It will also review existing measures, identify areas for improvement and propose potential reforms for the Governments consideration. Minister for Law Edwin Tong first agreed to the task forceat the inaugural Access to Justice (A2J) Symposium in March 2025,which addressed legal challenges faced by people with invisible disabilities. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development and Law Eric Chua and veteran lawyer Peggy Yee,a vocal advocate for people with such disabilities, are co-chairing the 20-member task force. Mr Chua said they have assembled a strong collaborative team, adding: Work will be done to review current practices, identify gaps and develop recommendations to address them. Ms Yee noted that individuals with mental health conditions and disabilities often cannot advocate for themselves and would benefit from dedicated support in navigating the justice system. We look forward to working with the task force members to co-create practical solutions that support vulnerable individuals with empathy and fairness as they interact with the criminal justice system, whether they are accused persons, victims or witnesses, said Ms Yee. The Inclusive Justice Taskforce comprises individuals from a wide range of fields. They include lawyers, policymakers, law enforcement officers, social service professionals, healthcare experts and caregivers. Among its members are Deputy Principal District Judge Kessler Soh, Chief Public Defender Wong Kok Weng, and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Investigation and Intelligence) Zhang Weihan, who is also director of the Criminal Investigation Department. Leaders from the social service sector on the task force include Minds chief executive Kelvin Koh, SPD chief executive Abhimanyau Pal, and Rainbow Centre executive director Tan Sze Wee. Also on the team are Dr Derrick Yeo, a senior consultant at the Institute of Mental Healths department of forensic psychiatry, and Dr Chen Shiling,the founder of Happee Hearts Movement, a non-profit that advocates quality healthcare for adults with intellectual disabilities. Representing caregivers perspectives are Dr Lim Hong Huay –a paediatrician who founded non-profit CaringSGto support caregivers of special needs children – and Mr Teo Weng Kie, managing director of law firm Securus Law. The announcement comes after several past initiatives to support such individuals within the legal system, such asthe Appropriate Adult Scheme for Persons with Mental Disabilities. Launched in 2015, the scheme assigns trained volunteers to assist those with intellectual disabilities, autism or mental health issues during interviews with the authorities. In the courts, the Mandatory Treatment Order was introduced in 2011, allowing offenders with psychiatric conditions to undergo treatment in lieu of time behind bars. Mr Koh of Minds told The Straits Times that a key issue he wants to address is developing support for people with intellectual disabilities who have minor offending behaviour, steering them away from incarceration. Currently, especially in cases where offending behaviour does not warrant full prosecution but still poses real challenges for families and the community, the pathways and grounds for offering rehabilitation or diversion remain unclear, he said. Mr Koh called for clearer, practical pathways for early access to support, be it through diversion options, tailored programmes or much better coordination across social services, healthcare and law enforcement. Ms Yee said that with input from the many agencies represented on the task force, members can be creative and think outside the box about meaningful new measures. The lawyer, who chaired the organising committee for the A2J Symposium, said she has heard from caregivers that they look forward to solutions which could ease their burdens. I am full of hope, said Ms Yee. I would like them to have this same hope that something can and will be done for them.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-task-force-reviewing-support-for-special-needs-mental-health-conditions-in-legal-system

Fans of Tamil movie star Vijay gutted after Jan 9 opening of latest flick Jana Nayagan cancelled,"Jan 08, 2026, 04:56 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 09:08 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5f8f91303630862867583b3ae80ab782bef190e7137778afcf407b143f231289,Patrons queueing at the SAS Cineplex box office in Causeway Point to purchase tickets to the Tamil film Jana Nayagan.PHOTOS: ST READER,"['Actors', 'India', 'Movies']","SINGAPORE – Fans of Indian movie star Vijay queued for hours to buy advance tickets to his latest flick but were left disappointed after it emerged that the film will not open on Jan 9 as planned. The movie, titled Jana Nayagan, could be the Tamil actors final film outing, ahead of Vijay, 51, standing in the Tamil Nadu assembly elections, which are expected to be called in the next few months. Undergraduate Mohamad Jafar, 23, who has been a Vijay fan since he was a child, said he queued up for nearly two hours at the SAS Cineplex in Causeway Point on Jan 7. He said: I cannot believe this has happened. Everyone in my family is upset about it. He added that he was waiting for weeks to watch the movie with his family. Film distributor KVN Productions, in an Instagram post on Jan 7, said the movies worldwide opening will be pushed back due to unavoidable circumstances beyond our control. It added that a new release date will be made public soon. The postponement came hours after a Madras High Court hearing that is linked to delays in the films censorcertification in India. The court is likely to issue a ruling on Jan 9, which means the film is not expected to open until a later date, Indian daily The Hindu reported. In Singapore, fans thronged the Shaw and Golden Village (GV) cinemas when ticket sales opened on Jan 7 and queued for hours. Others tried their luck with online ticketing platforms. The most coveted tickets were for the first screening on opening day – which many die-hard Vijay fans want to go for. In response to queries from The Straits Times, a GV spokeswoman said patrons who bought tickets can get refunds. She said: We have contacted affected patrons who made their purchase online. For tickets bought online, refunds will be processed by GV in seven to 14 working days, directly back to the method of payment. For tickets purchased at the box office, customers can proceed to any GV cinema for a refund, she added. Engineer A. Rishikumar, 43, who booked tickets online, was crestfallen. He said: I am very disappointed. I have been waiting for almost a year to watch this movie. Vijay, whose full name is Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, is among the most successful actors in Tamil cinema. To his fans in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and other parts of the world, he is known as Thalapathy,which means commander in Tamil. In a career spanning more than65 films across three decades, he became known for roles that combine action, dance and social themes. His latest movie, Jana Nayagan, which means hero of the people, is expected to be his swan song before he shifts his focus to politics. Vijay launched the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam party in early 2024, treading a well-worn path of Indian actors entering politics. He has not quit films officially but has hinted at the possibility, saying politics would require his full-time commitment. According to The Hindus Jan 8 report, the release delay of Jana Nayagan stems from a dispute involving Indias Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), which refused to issue censor certification to it. This is despite the filmmakers agreeing to make 27 cuts in the film.

Shanmugam (left) and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng claim the article falsely implied they exploited a lack of transparency in their property dealings.PHOTOS: LIANHE ZAOBAO, AZMI ATHNI","['K Shanmugam', 'Tan See Leng']","SINGAPORE – Financial news provider Bloomberg is set to contest allegations of defamation by Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng in a civil trial in April. Following months of case conferences, trial dates have been set for eight days between April 7 and 16, according to court records. The case involves statements that appeared in a Dec 12, 2024 Bloomberg article on good class bungalow (GCB) transactions in Singapore headlined Singapore mansion deals are increasingly shrouded in secrecy. The article had referenced separate GCB transactions that involved Mr Shanmugam and Dr Tan, and both ministerssaid on Dec 16 that they considered the article libellousand would be taking legal action against Bloomberg. It had cited Mr Shanmugams use of a trust structure to sell a bungalow in the Queen Astrid Park area and Dr Tans non-caveated purchase of a GCB in Brizay Park, among other examples of landed property deals. A caveat is a legal document that property buyers can submit to the Singapore Land Authority to register their interest in a property and prevent other people from buying it. On Jan 6, 2025, separate claims were filed by both ministers against the US media organisation and the reporter behind the story, Mr Low De Wei. According to their 49-page statements of claim, the ministers said the article was understood to falsely mean that they had taken advantage of there being no checks and balances or disclosure requirements to carry out their property dealings in a non-transparent manner. This was to hide their transactions and avoid scrutiny, including about the possibility of money laundering, they contended. Mr Shanmugam and Dr Tan said the offending words in the article were false and baseless, and were calculated to disparage and impugn them, as well as the ministerial offices they held. In its defence submissions to the court on Feb 5, 2025, Bloomberg denied the claims, and said that as a news platform focused on reporting relating to finance, markets and economics, it has no interest nor reason to, and did not in fact impugn the reputation of the ministers. It said that the focus of the article was twofold – first, to highlight that purchases of GCBs which are not caveated bring some privacy benefits and typically transact at a higher price; and second, that buyers of GCBs who do not want their identities to be publicly discoverable use trust structures to purchase them. Bloomberg said it was not defamatory to state that a buyer of a property can make use of the relative privacy offered by not lodging a caveat. Neither was it defamatory to state that a person wished to keep his property transaction out of the public eye to avoid drawing attention to their wealth and social status as the law permits, even if one is of the view that the law should change, it added. On Dec 23, 2024, correction directions were issued against Bloomberg in relation to the article under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, Singapores fake news law. The Ministry of Law said then that the false statements in Bloombergs article attack the transparency of property transactions in Singapore and give the impression that Singapore does not have a robust legal framework to require disclosure of information to the Government in GCB transactions. Bloomberg subsequently put up a correction notice on the article but said it had done so under the threat of sanction. The Edge Singapore, The Independent Singapore and The Online Citizen were also issued correction orders for carrying in part or in full the statements published in the Bloomberg piece. The articles by The Edge Singapore and The Independent Singapore were subsequently taken down, while The Online Citizen published the correction notice. The two ministers are represented by a team of lawyers from Davinder Singh Chambers, including Mr Davinder Singh and Mr David Fong Cheng Yee, court records show. Bloomberg is represented by a team of lawyers from RCLT Law Corporation, including Mr Remy Choo Zheng Xi and Mr Donaven Foo, while Mr Low is represented by Mr Wong Thai Yong, from his eponymous firm. The Straits Times understands that Bloomberg is also represented by Mr N. Sreenivasan, while Mr Low, the reporter, is also represented by Mr Chelva Retnam Rajah.

Republic Polytechnic to expand use of AI in students learning,"Jan 08, 2026, 04:45 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 09:19 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/13ed2cf32482da426fc4d9ee7b24449722b622212421931e321a42b0b3bfa692,Third year RP student Kymberly Uthaya Kumar (left) speaking with Senior Minister of State for Education David Neo (centre) and RP principal Jeanne Liew (right) at the launch of RPs AI Transformation strategy on Jan 8.ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY,"['Polytechnics', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'Education and schools']","SINGAPORE – All students at Republic Polytechnic (RP) will be using artificial intelligence (AI) more deeply in their coursework, thanks to a campus-wide push to ensure they are proficient with the technology when they join the workforce. Rather than learning about AI as a standalone subject, students will encounter and use AI directly in existing study modules alongside their problem-based learning approach. The use of AI will vary across the various disciplines in RP. For example, in supply chain courses, students will use AI tools to analyse demand patterns, optimise inventory and plan efficient delivery routes. The polytechnic said these are skills that are increasingly in demand in global logistics. Creative arts and media students, meanwhile, will learn to integrate generative AI tools into content creation processes, from ideation and storyboarding to post-production, while learning to maintain creative control and ethical standards. An AI-driven chatbot, designed specifically to train students studying hotel and leisure management, can simulate guest interactions to help trainees develop soft skills through immersive, scenario-based practice. It gives students the flexibility to practise and strengthen their skills anytime, anywhere, enhancing real-world readiness. RP said such tools allow students to gain realistic practice while freeing up classroom time for deeper discussion and reflection. By the 2027 academic year, at least half of the discipline-specific modules in every diploma will incorporate AI tools and applications that mirror those used in the workplace. The sweeping changes are part of the polytechnics AI Transformation strategy aimed at giving students hands-on experience with real-world technologies. This is critical as industries increasingly demand workers who can work confidently and responsibly alongside AI. To be implemented progressively at four levels, the changes will first help students develop a foundational understanding of AI before teaching them how to apply AI tools ethically and responsibly. More advanced modules will then involve developing industry-relevant AI tools, before culminating in AI design at the last level. Assessment practices will also be updated in tandem with these changes. Said RP: Learners are now evaluated not only on final outputs, but also on their thinking processes, use of AI tools and ability to work effectively alongside them. Speaking at the launch event for RPs AI Transformation strategy at its open house on Jan 8, Mr David Neo, Senior Minister of State for Education, echoed the need to nurture an AI-ready workforce. To do so, institutes of higher learning (IHLs) like RP have to play a key role in upskilling the workforce through Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes. We want to maintain Singapores human capital as our greatest competitive advantage, and enable every Singaporean to access good jobs, said Mr Neo, who is also the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth. He added that there are now more than 1,600 SkillsFuture Singapore-supported AI-related courses that support AI competency-building for various skill levels and needs. Emphasising the need to start young, Mr Neo said the Education Ministry is also preparing students to be AI-ready with the right mindsets and skills to thrive in future workplaces. To this end, students will not only learn about AI and how to use it, but will also learn with and beyond AI, by leveraging it to enhance learning outcomes. Other IHLs have also introduced AI into their curricula. Ngee Ann Polytechnicbegan integrating Gen AI into its curricula from 2023, with students across all diploma courses set to experience it by 2026. Singapore Polytechnic equips all students with basic AI literacy through a common core curriculum, while Nanyang Polytechnic has embedded baseline Gen AI training in all diploma programmes since October 2025. Temasek Polytechnic launched anexperimental design studioin January 2024, giving design students a space to learn and experiment with Gen AI. At the tertiary level, the Singapore University of Technology and Design is providing all first-year students with comprehensive training in Design AI skills, through a specially designed course. Miss Kymberly Uthaya Kumar, 20, a third-year student pursuing a diploma in engineering design and business at RP, said she had many opportunities to dabble with AI during her time at the poly. These included learning how to connect AI with applications when she was learning about the Internet of Things in her first year, and using AI to provide unique design features for a Year 2 project. By her third year, she grew confident enough to use AI independently as part of her learning, even though it was not part of her coursework. AI helps make work more efficient and productive, but I have learnt that we always need to check AIs output, as it can make mistakes, said Miss Kymberly. She added that RPs AI overhaul is a great opportunity for students to prepare to enter the workforce with relevant skills. I am sure AI will feature in my future studies and work even, so it is good to be exposed to it and guided on how to use it in school, she said. The AI push also extends to RPs CET programmes, with AI competencies being infused into specialist and part-time diplomas to help adult learners keep up with rapidly changing workplace technologies. Depending on the programme, CET learners may use AI tools for productivity, data analysis or decision-making, with some courses offering opportunities to develop or use AI tools relevant to their industries. In support of these changes, RP has expanded partnerships with major AI and technology companies. These include AI Singapore, Autodesk, Microsoft, Nvidia and ST Engineering. Through these collaborations, students gain access to industry-grade tools and platforms – generative design software, cybersecurity systems and AI-powered academic planning tools. They can also take part in applied research projects, innovation challenges and industry-led training provided by these companies, which RP said stand to benefit from the strengthened talent pipeline and joint development of AI solutions. To further aid in these efforts, all 1,200 RP staff will undergo AI capability development, ranging from basic proficiency in role-relevant tools to advanced certification. RP said more than half of its staff have already attained baseline AI capability, with all of them expected to reach this level by the end of 2026. Ms Jeanne Liew, RPs principal and chief executive, said the goal of this transformation is to create an environment where every learner is empowered to succeed in the AI era. By bringing the use of AI into the classroom, strengthening workforce capabilities and working closely with industry partners, she said learners will have the confidence, judgment and skills to use and navigate new technologies. Our purpose is ultimately about giving our learners the opportunity to adapt, grow and excel in a fast-changing world, said Ms Liew.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/republic-polytechnic-to-expand-use-of-ai-in-students-learning

China accuses Japan of rising nuclear ambitions under its right-leaning government,"Jan 08, 2026, 11:30 PM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:38 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1b841dad1adc67f0899e8796809c02e074bd1a91509f4759b9fef561959ec0da,Beijing in recent days has rolled out export bans and a trade probe that tighten pressure on Tokyos economic and security interests.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['China', 'Japan', 'Nuclear weapons', 'Defence and military', 'Sanae Takaichi']","BEIJING– China has charged that Japans expanding nuclear ambitions under its right-leaning Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi are threatening world peace and stability, amid a deepening diplomatic stand-off between the neighbours. Beijing has in recent days rolled out export bans and a trade probe, tightening pressure on Tokyos economic and security interests. On Jan 8, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing that the new Japanese government has not hesitated to reveal the nuclear ambitions of Japans right-wing forces. This, she noted, is a dangerous signal of the resurgence of Japanese militarism and poses a serious threat to world peace and stability. She urged Japan to heed the call of the international community for justice, immediately clarify its position on the issue of nuclear weapons and abide by its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its three non-nuclear principles. The NPT is a global treaty aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclear arms, and Japans three non-nuclear principles adopted in the post-war era commit it to not possessing, producing or permitting the introduction of such weapons. Ms Maos comments followed the release of a new research report by two Chinese think-tanks on Dec 8, calling for heightened international vigilance over what it outlined as Japans rising right-wing nuclear ambitions. Ms Mao also said that senior Japanese officials, including Ms Takaichi herself, had sought the revision of the countrys three non-nuclear principles, implied the introduction of nuclear-powered submarines, and called for boosting of the extended deterrence that Japan receives from its ally the US and openly claimed that Japan should possess nuclear weapons. These concerns echoed those in the research report. At a press conference to launch the report, China Arms Control and Disarmament Association secretary-general Dai Huicheng had said that the statements by various Japanese officials were not isolated or personal views. These are a series of remarks by Japan meant to test international reactions and to challenge the bottom line of the world, he said. China and Japan have been locked in adiplomatic spatfor more than two months after Ms Takaichi said on Nov 7, 2025, that any use of force by Beijing against self-governing Taiwan, which China claims as its own, could justify a military response from Tokyo. Beijing has slammed her remarks as provocative and demanded that she withdraw her erroneous statements, a demand Ms Takaichi has so far not met. Beijing has since signalled that its response would not be confined to rhetoric. On Jan 6, Chinas Commerce Ministry announced aban on exports of dual-use itemsto Japan if the authorities determine that the end users or end use would contribute to enhancing Japanese military capabilities. It did not specify the items that may be affected by the ban. Dual-use items are goods, software or technology with both civilian and military applications, and include certain rare earth magnets that are used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence-related equipment such as radar systems. Mr Chen Yang, a research fellow at Chinese think-tank Charhar Institute, said the ambiguity over the scope of the restrictions was itself part of the pressure on Japan. By not defining which dual-use items are covered, Beijing is introducing uncertainty that could complicate business expectations and investment planning, which would weigh on Japans economy. These could be rare earths, which Japan is most concerned about, but they could also involve a much broader range of raw materials, technologies, chemical products and so on, said Mr Chen, who is an expert on Sino-Japanese ties. Also on Jan 6, Chinese state media outlet China Daily reported, citing unnamed sources, that Beijing was considering tightening export permit reviews for certain rare earth products to Japan. Chinas Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong on Jan 8 clarified that the export ban on dual-use items will affect only military firms and not civilian users. However, Mr He did not specify whether rare earths were covered under the restrictions. Neither did he comment when asked about the state media report and if the Commerce Ministry was weighing whether to tighten rare earth export licences to Japan. Japans Vice-Foreign Minister Takehiro Funakoshi on Jan 8 strongly protested to Chinas Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao about the ban and demanded that China withdraw the measures. His demands were rejected, the Chinese embassy said in a statement. Beijing on Jan 7 launched an anti-dumping probe into Japanese exports of dichlorosilane, a critical chipmaking chemical used in semiconductor manufacturing. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the investigation was initiated at the request of a domestic firm, which alleged that dumped imports had harmed Chinas industry. A widespread curb on rare earth exports to Japan could have a severe impact if realised, observers said. Beijing has used rare earths as leverage against Tokyo before, in 2010 during a diplomatic crisis over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, when shipments of rare earths to Japan were disrupted, sending shockwaves through Japans manufacturing sector. Since then, Japan has been working to diversify its supply sources away from China. Charhar Institutes Mr Chen said Beijings actions in the last few days clearly signalled an escalation from verbal protests to substantive countermeasures. He said the dual-use item ban and the research report together formed a coordinated message showing that Beijing is prepared to deploy both economic tools and narrative framing to push back against Japans right wing and what it sees as an increasingly assertive security posture. China is tearing off the right wings disguise of Japan as a peaceful country, he said.",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-accuses-japan-of-rising-nuclear-ambitions-under-its-right-leaning-government

In a lawsuitfiled at the Yokohama District Court in January 2023,Ms Gonoi, 26, sought damages from the state and five former GSDF members for causing her mental distress while she belonged to a unit at Camp Koriyama in Fukushima Prefecture. She left the GSDF in 2022.

On Jan 8, the Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) announced that the case against Dr Zahid, who is president of UMNO, will be formally closed. The charges against him had involved funds belonging to his charitable foundation Yayasan Akalbudi. Following further investigations by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission into the source and use of the foundations funds, the AGC concluded that there was not enough evidence to justify pursuing prosecution, leading to a decision of no further action. After studying all the evidence and new statements obtained from further investigations, the AGC, based on the assessment of the prosecution, finds that there is insufficient evidence to support the continuation of the prosecution for all of the charges, the AGC said on Jan 8. It added: This decision thus brings this case to a final conclusion, in accordance with the power and discretion of the Attorney-General under the Federal Constitution and related laws. Dr Zahid was first charged in 2018 in relation to this corruption case, a few months after the once-dominant UMNO lost power at that years general election amid public anger over graft allegations linked to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) state fund. In September 2023, the Kuala Lumpur High Court had granted Dr Zahid a discharge not amounting to acquittal after the prosecution applied to discontinue the proceedings, citing the need for further investigations. The decision meant that he could, in principle, have been charged again over the same allegations in the future, but the AGCs latest statement has now brought the matter to a close. After the announcement, Dr Zahid posted on his Facebook account: Praise be to God. In the end, time answers everything, and the truth has been proven. Mr Amir Fareed Rahim, strategic director at risk consultancy KRA Group, said that the development was timely for Dr Zahid ahead of the upcoming UMNO annual general assembly scheduled for Jan 14 to 17. The news will certainly be welcome for Zahid ahead of the next UMNO AGM, as he will be able to face his critics with renewed credibility among the party faithful. This will further increase Zahids already strong grip over the party, he told The Straits Times. The timing of the decision was significant, Mr Amir said, amid calls from some quarters for UMNO to withdraw from the ruling unity government coalition. This comes after former prime minister and UMNO chiefNajib Razak was sentenced to 15 years jailon Dec 26, 2025, after he was found guilty of abuse of power and money laundering charges linked to 1MDB. Pressure has mounted for UMNO to leave the ruling government and revive the Muafakat Nasional alliance with the Islamist opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia, which was in place from 2019 to 2022. This decision could strengthen ties between Zahid-led UMNO and Pakatan Harapan, Mr Amir said, referring to Datuk Seri Anwars ruling coalition. At the same time, he said that the move would not sit well with some members of the public. Those who are anti-UMNO will take this as proof of further reformist backsliding by Mr Anwars government, said Mr Amir. Calls to separate the roles of attorney-general and public prosecutor will increase, and so it gives an urgency to the PMs pledge to do so, he added. Mr Anwar, in his New Year address, said he would table Bills in Parliament to separate the powers of the attorney-general and public prosecutor, in a move that proponents hope would make the judiciary more independent.",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-confirms-final-closure-of-graft-case-against-deputy-pm-zahid-ahead-of-umno-assembly

Jeju Air Flight 2216 was coming in to land at Muan International Airport from Thailand when it struck a flock of birds and was forced to make a belly landing. Bystander footage showed the pilots were able to bring the plane down before itcollided with a concrete barrier,known as a localiser, at the end of the runway and burst into a fireball. The crash killed everyone on board except for two flight attendants seated in the tail section. The presence of the concrete structure, housing a radio antenna system and used to help planes navigate landings, sparked outrage and protests from victims families. International aviation safety guidelines say such navigation facilities should be made of frangible, or breakable, materials. The government-commissioned simulation concluded that all passengers would have survived with only minor injuries, according to opposition lawmaker Kim Eun-hye, who released the findings. If the guidance facility at Muan Airport had been supported by a frangible structure, the aircraft would likely have breached the perimeter fence, and the resulting impact would not have been severe enough to cause serious injuries, the simulation report said. The impact sustained by the aircraft during its ground slide was not of a magnitude sufficient to cause serious injuries, it said. The aircraft would have slid for approximately 770metres before coming to a stop had the runway been free of obstacles, the study found. The localisers damaged in the crash were still standing at the end of the runway when AFP visited the site in December, while what appeared to be fragments of concrete slabs lay strewn across a nearby field. Ms Lee Hyo-eun, whose 24-year-old daughter was killed, told AFP the findings confirmed the families long-held suspicions. For a long time, we believed that everyone could have survived – including my daughter – had there not been a concrete structure at the end of the runway, she said.

"China-bound exports of Japanese sake, food items delayed amid row: Sources","Jan 08, 2026, 09:29 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 09:31 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/41cc72de4d320a468e44a10d91c6e80728e11479a9aa391e2c0808281193ca01,Trade industry sources said that customs clearance of some sake items have doubled in some cases.PHOTO: UNSPLASH,"['Japan', 'Japanese food', 'Alcohol']","TOKYO- China-bound exports of Japanese sake and food items have been delayed amid an escalating diplomatic row between Beijing and Tokyo over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichis remarks in November 2025 on a Taiwan contingency, trade industry sources said on Jan 8. The slow customs clearance in China is believed to be part of its measures in response to Ms Takaichis comments that suggested Japan would act in the event of coercive measures against Taiwan. According to the sources, the Japanese embassy in Beijing has received inquiries from affected companies. Following Ms Takaichis remarks, China has increased its economic pressure on Japan, urging its citizens not to visit it and reinstating its ban on Japanese seafood imports. On Jan 6, Chinatightened its exports to Japan of dual-use items that have both civilian and military applications. Sake exports to China amounted to some 11.6 billion yen (S$95 million) in 2024, representing Japans largest sake export market by value, according to the Japanese farm ministry. The sources said that customs procedures after sake items recently arrived in China took longer than usual – spanning several weeks to a month – with the clearance time doubling in some cases. Speculation was rife that the Chinese authorities may have targeted the liquor because it is a symbol of Japan. The delays have been confirmed at various ports in China, including Tianjin and Shenzhen, the sources said. Exports of some foodstuffs and processed food items have also been delayed. In some instances, the Chinese customs authorities have asked for detailed transportation routes of the goods in Japan to check whether they had travelled through prefectures such as Fukushima, Miyagi and Tokyo, the sources said. A Chinese ban remains in place on marine and other food products from 10 of Japans 47 prefectures. The ban was imposed after a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster. A source familiar with the countries bilateral relationship said Beijing has opted for retaliatory steps in its feud with Japan that would not harm its own economy amid a prolonged property sector crisis in China. Shipments of goods bound for Chinese companies have been processed as usual, but some Japanese businesses have complained that joint projects with state-run Chinese firms have been halted or postponed. A trade industry source said delays in customs clearance for sake products may only amount to harassment, as their impact on the Chinese economy is deemed to be relatively small. Beijing strengthened its customs inspections in the early 2010s, following bilateral tensions over the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which China claims and calls Diaoyu. At that time, delays over a wide range of items were confirmed, including for electronic parts.

Here is what is known about the secretive man wanted by law enforcement around the world. At age 27,Chen founded the Prince Group, a Cambodian conglomerate with fingers in everything from real estate to banking and airlines, as well as – according to US prosecutors – cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes that stole billions of dollars from victims worldwide. According to an indictment filed in a Brooklyn court in 2025, Chen and his top executives grew Prince Group, whichoperated more than 100 business entitiesin over 30 countries, into one of the largest transnational criminal organisations in Asia. Many of the scam centres used forced labour, according to United Nations investigators. Prince Group has denied wrongdoing. Reuters could not reach Chen, Prince Group, or their representatives on Jan 8. Cambodia said he had been arrested after a joint investigation with China into transnational crime. Beijing had been probing Prince Group since 2020 and has a close relationship with Cambodia. US prosecutors said Chen used political influence and bribes to avoid punishment for years, and also used legal businesses such as casinos to launder stolen funds. They also said he had communications with members of Chinas state security. Chen and his associates devoted their illicit gains to luxury travel and entertainment and purchases of watches, yachts, private jets, vacation homes, high-end collectibles and rare artwork, including a Picasso painting in New York, according to the US indictment. Born in 1987 in Chinas Fujian province, Chen got his start establishing an internet cafe and gaming centres in Fuzhou, according to an archived biography on the Prince Groups website, which called him a young business prodigy. He acquired Cambodian citizenship in 2014, an option available to applicants who donate US$250,000 (S$321,000) to the state. He was later given the title Neak Oknha (tycoon), which requires a donation of at least US$500,000 to the government. Cambodia said it had stripped him of his citizenship when it extradited him to China. US authorities said Chen had given up his Chinese citizenship, but Chinese and Cambodian statements about his arrest referred to him as a Chinese national. The US indictment said he had also held citizenship in Vanuatu, St Lucia and Cyprus, and lived in Cambodia, Singapore, Taiwan and Britain. In 2014, Chen was abducted from a hotel in Thailand by men citing a Chinese arrest warrant who forced him into a black SUV, according to the Bangkok Post. He was later released in Cambodia and did not file a complaint with Thai authorities. Prince Group websites call Chen a respected entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist who had established a scholarship in his name for 400 Cambodian university students, and donated over US$16 million in recent years to aid the local community through various assistance activities and efforts. He had taken a low profile for years until Chinese state media showed video on Jan 8 of him being shackled and hooded and escorted by armed guards on the extradition flight from Cambodia.

REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro","['Pakistan', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Loans']","ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 - Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year. The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is facing acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about U.S. commitments in the Middle East. The mutual defence deal was signed following Israels strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region. One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion. The first source said the total deal was worth $4 billion, with an additional $2 billion to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion. The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal. Pakistans military and finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabias government media office also did not respond. Pakistans Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia this week to discuss bilateral defence cooperation, regional security environment and future avenues of collaboration with his counterpart Lieutenant General Turki bin Bander bin Abdulaziz, Pakistans military said in a statement on Thursday. TESTED IN COMBAT Aamir Masood, a retired Air Marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment including JF-17s and electronic systems and weapons systems for the jets. He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations. The JF-17s marketability has been increased because it is tested and has been used in combat, he told Reuters, adding that its also cost effective. Pakistan has said the aircraft was deployed during its conflict with India in May last year, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades. The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership. Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress. In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6 billion support package for Pakistan, including a $3 billion deposit at the central bank and $3 billion worth of oil supplies on deferred payment. Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2 billion deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures. ARMS SALES OUTREACH Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry. Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion with Libyas eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the countrys largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft. Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East. On Tuesday, Pakistans defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the countrys economic outlook. Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months, Khawaja Asif told broadcaster Geo News. Pakistan is currently under a $7 billion IMF programme, its 24th, which followed a short-term $3 billion deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Funds support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.

Denmarks Ambassador Jesper Moller Sorensen and Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenlands chief representative to Washington, met with officials at the White House National Security Council, the official said on condition of anonymity. The White House did not immediately confirm the meeting. The talks were described as an effort to get more clarity on US comments over the past week about Greenland. The White House said on Jan 6 that the US is considering a range of options to acquire Greenland, and that US military force was among the options. The purchase of the territory is also an option, US officals said. President Donald Trump has said the US needs Greenland for national security. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to meet with Danish officials next week in Washington. Greenland has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo","['Donald Trump', 'Nigeria', 'Militants']","WASHINGTON, Jan 8 - President Donald Trump said there could be more strikes by the U.S. in Nigeria if Christians are killed in the African nation, even as Nigeria has previously denied Christians there are subjected to systematic persecution. Trumps comments in an interview with the New York Times were published on the newspapers website on Thursday. Trump made the remarks when asked about Washingtons Christmas Day military strike in Nigeria. The U.S. military said at the time it carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigerias government. Nigeria said then that the strike was a joint operation targeting terrorists, and had nothing to do with a particular religion. Id love to make it a one-time strike ... But if they continue to kill Christians, it will be a many-time strike, Trump was quoted as saying. When asked about his own Africa adviser having said that Islamic State and Boko Haram militants were killing more Muslims than Christians, Trump responded: I think that Muslims are being killed also in Nigeria. But its mostly Christians. Trump, in late October, began warning that Christianity faces an existential threat in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities. Nigerias population of over 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims, who predominate in the north. While Nigeria has had persistent security problems, including violence and kidnappings by Islamist insurgents in the north, it strongly denies that Christians are subjected to systematic persecution. Its government responded to Trumps past threats by saying it intended to work with Washington against militants, while rejecting U.S. language that suggested Christians were in particular peril. Nigerian authorities note that militants have killed many Muslims as well as Christians.

The Iranian economy is on the ropes, Bessent told the Economic Club of Minnesota, underscoring President Donald Trumps warning to Tehran to avoid harming protesters. Its a very precarious moment. He does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment, the U.S. Treasury secretary said, referring to Trumps threat on Sunday to hit Tehran if it began killing protesters. Were watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think theyre going to get hit very hard by the United States, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. Rights groups say at least 25 people were killed in Iran during the first nine days of protests that started in the bazaar of Tehran over the plunging value of the currency and soaring inflation, the biggest wave of dissent in three years. The protests have since spread nationwide amid deepening distress over rocketing inflation driven by mismanagement and Western sanctions, and curbs on political and social freedoms. Iranian authorities have acknowledged the economic hardships facing Iranians, but accused networks linked to foreign powers of stoking the protests. Irans top judge warned protesters on Wednesday there would be no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic. Bessent said it was clear that what had been an affluent society that still maintained a high standard of living is really crumbling, and a lot of that is through the sanctions. He said it was unclear how Tehran planned to finance the rebuilding of its nuclear program. Trumps threat to come to the aid of protesters if security forces fire on them comes seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war. Trump often references the U.S. and Israeli attacks as an example of what he sees as his strong leadership on global affairs.

The votes to overturn the presidential vetoes were an unusual challenge from the Republican-controlled Congress, which has largely backed Trump during his first year in office as he has canceled billions of dollars in spending, hiked tariffs and taken action in other areas that are usually handled on Capitol Hill. Congress has shown a hint of independence recently. The Senate advanced legislation on Thursday that would prevent Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional approval. The Senate has also rebuffed Trumps calls to change rules that give Democrats some power in that chamber, and lawmakers in both chambers voted overwhelmingly to force his administration to release material related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Still, the House did not clear the two-thirds supermajority needed to override Trumps vetoes of two infrastructure projects: a $1.3 billion drinking-water project in Colorado and a $14 million project in the Everglades National Park that would have benefited the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. Both projects had passed Congress unanimously. Colorado Democrats accused Trump of using the veto to punish the state for imprisoning Tina Peters, a former election official found guilty of tampering with voting machines in the 2020 presidential election. In a letter, Republican and Democratic lawmakers from Colorado warned no bill is safe if Congress allows Trumps veto to stand. Trump vetoed 10 bills in his first term as president.

Vance addressing the media at the White House on Jan 8.PHOTO: EPA,"['United States', 'Donald Trump', 'JD Vance', 'Greenland', 'Denmark']","WASHINGTON - US Vice President J.D. Vance warned Europe on Jan 8 to take Donald Trump seriously on Greenland, as the president ramps up threats against the Danish-ruled Arctic territory. Mr Vance accused fellow NATO member Denmark and the rest of Europe of failing to do enough to protect the strategically-located island from the designs of Russia and China. European capitals have been scrambling to come up with a coordinated response after the White House said this week that Mr Trump wanted to buy Greenland and refused to rule out military action. I guess my advice to European leaders and anybody else would be to take the president of the United States seriously, Mr Vance told a briefing at the White House when asked about Greenland. Mr Vance urged them to respond in particular to Mr Trumps insistence that the US needs the island for missile defence, with Moscow and Beijing increasing military activities nearby and the Arctic ice melting due to climate change. So what were asking our European friends to do is to take the security of that land mass more seriously, because if theyre not, the United States is going to have to do something about it, Mr Vance said. What that is, Ill leave that to the president as we continue to engage in diplomacy with our European friends and everybody on this particular topic. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to meet officials from Denmark and Greenland next week. An emboldened Mr Trump has long talked about acquiring Greenland but has ramped up his threats since the US military operation to topple Venezuelas ruler Nicolas Maduro last week. The threats have infuriated Denmark, a founding NATO member and long-time US ally, and set alarm bells ringing across Europe. An invasion would pit Washington against fellow NATO member Denmark and threaten to blow up the entire military alliance, which is based on a mutual self-defence clause. A flurry of diplomacy is under way as Europeans try to head off a crisis while at the same time avoiding the wrath of Mr Trump, who is nearing the end of his first year back in power. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer set out his position on Greenland during a call with Mr Trump on Jan 7 and then said more could be done to protect the high Arctic from Russia in a second call on Jan 8, Downing Street said. Mr Vance was meeting British Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy in Washington for talks that would focus on the Ukraine war, but where Greenland could come up. European countries have stood in solidarity with Denmark, with key leaders issuing a joint statement with Copenhagen saying it was for Denmark and Greenland alone to decide its fate. French President Emmanuel Macron even warned on Jan 8 that the US was turning away from allies in some of his strongest criticism yet of Mr Trumps policies. Mr Macron said global governance was key at a time when every day people wonder whether Greenland is going to be invaded. Mr Vance, however, has long been critical of Europe over defence issues, saying in a leaked chat with senior US officials in 2025 that he hated bailing out the continent. The Trump administrations new US national security strategy launched a brutal attack on Europe in December, describing it as facing civilisational erasure from migration and calling for cultivating resistance among right-wing parties.

Picture taken October 26, 2020. REUTERS/Feisal Omar",['Somalia'],"WASHINGTON/NAIROBI, Jan 8 - Relations between Somalia and the U.S. hit a low point after Washington said it would pause further assistance that benefits the government in Mogadishu amid a dispute over the demolition of a World Food Programme warehouse. The U.S. State Departments under secretary of foreign assistance said in an X post on Wednesday that Somali government officials had destroyed a U.S.-funded WFP warehouse and illegally seized donor-funded food aid for vulnerable Somalis. As a result, he said, Washington was suspending aid to Somalia. The value of the aid was not immediately clear. A WFP spokesperson on Thursday told Reuters the program had retrieved 75 metric tons of nutritional commodities. A day earlier, another WFP spokesperson said the warehouse containing that same amount of assistance was demolished by port authorities. A U.S. official said Washington was glad to hear reports that certain commodities have been recovered, adding that the administration is continuing its investigation into diversion and misuse of assistance in Somalia. Weve urged the Federal Government of Somalia to promptly follow through on their commitment to provide an account of the incident, the official said. NOTICE TO VACATE Somalias Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier on Thursday had disputed the assertion that the U.S.-provided aid had been stolen, and said it remained in WFP custody. It said expansion and repurposing works had been taking place in the Mogadishu Port area, where the warehouse originally holding the aid - known as the blue warehouse - was located. Those operations have not affected the custody, management, or distribution of humanitarian assistance, it added. The WFP spokesperson said on Wednesday that the agency was working with the authorities to address the issue and ensure the safe storage of food after the demolition of the warehouse. The warehouse contained 75 metric tons of specialized nutritious foods intended for the treatment of malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls and young children. The warehouse is crucial for WFPs emergency operations at a moment when almost a quarter of the population (4.4 million people) are facing crisis levels of hunger or worse, the spokesperson said. A Mogadishu Port Authority shipment handover note, seen by Reuters and dated Wednesday, says WFP took over the food that had been earlier shifted from the blue warehouse to another warehouse. The note appears to be signed by a WFP Somalia official and includes a handwritten comment saying WFP will confirm final receipt of the food once a lab test confirms it is suitable for human consumption. According to a letter to the WFP country director seen by Reuters, Somalias Ministry of Ports and Marine Transport in November provided official notice that the program was required to vacate the blue warehouse by December 31 as a result of plans to relocate port offices. MINNESOTA TENSION In Trumps second term, the Republican president has pursued an aggressive immigration policy that has posed a stumbling block to relations between Washington and Mogadishu. The Trump administration has barred citizens of Somalia from entering the U.S., and last month said it was auditing immigration cases involving U.S. citizens of Somali origin to detect fraud. It has also leveled fraud allegations against some nonprofit groups in Minnesotas Somali community, with at least 56 people pleading guilty since federal prosecutors under the previous Democratic administration of Joe Biden started investigating childcare and other social service programs in the Somali community. The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that any resumption in assistance would be dependent on Somalias government taking accountability and remedial steps. Since returning to office last year, the Trump administration has more widely slashed U.S. aid spending, shifting the U.S. priority in Africa from assistance to trade. On Thursday, the U.S. embassy in South Sudan said it was suspending assistance to an area in South Sudan and considering significant reductions in another area after what it said was South Sudanese officials interference and the exploitation and theft of U.S. aid.

The release of San Miguel, an expert on topics including security, defense and Venezuelas military, was the first confirmed liberation after Venezuelas top lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez said earlier in the day that a significant number of both foreign and Venezuelan prisoners would be freed in the coming hours. The liberations come during a week of political turmoil for Caracas, after the U.S. ouster of President Nicolas Maduro, his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, the swearing in of Interim President Delcy Rodriguez and announcements that the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude oil stuck in Venezuela under U.S. sanctions. The U.S. Senate advanced a resolution on Thursday that would bar President Donald Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional authorization, paving the way for further consideration in the 100-member chamber. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies imprisoned, has repeatedly demanded releases. Venezuelas opposition and human rights groups have said for years that the government uses detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics and that arbitrary legal proceedings against activists, journalists, opposition politicians and others increased ahead of, during and after disputed 2024 elections, which the opposition and some international observers say the opposition won by a landslide. Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government have repeatedly denied that Venezuela holds political prisoners, with Saab saying those detained were arrested for various crimes. San Miguel was detained in February 2024 at Maiquetia international airport near capital city Caracas, an arrest widely condemned on social media by opposition politicians and human rights groups. Venezuelan authorities said they arrested some 2,000 people for their role in protests after the election and despite several mass releases, leading local rights group Foro Penal estimates there are 863 political prisoners in the country, including people arrested before the vote. That figure includes at least 86 foreign detainees, some of whom are facing criminal charges, from the United States, Spain and other countries. Spains Foreign Ministry said in an earlier statement it welcomed the release of five Spanish citizens, one of whom holds dual nationality, who are now preparing to travel to Spain, but did not give names.

Plumes of smoke rose above the city skyline at dusk and the boom of artillery could be heard across Aleppo as the Kurdish fighters tried to repel the troops advance and cling on to neighbourhoods under their control. The fighting, which erupted on Jan 6, has driven more than 140,000 people from their homes and left at least seven civilians dead, according to Syrian authorities. The deadly stand-off between Damascus and Kurdish authorities who have resisted integrating into the central government is a major challenge for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has pledged to unite the country after 14 years of civil war. Syrias army gave a window on Jan 8 for residents to evacuate the neighbourhoods held by Kurdish forces in Aleppo before launching new strikes there. It released more than seven maps identifying areas it said would be targeted and announced a curfew in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh from 3pm. The Kurdish forces, including the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Asayish, or internal security forces, said they had pushed back Syrian troops attacks. The United States on Jan 8 called for an end to clashes between government troops and Kurdish fighters in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, saying it was gravely concerned by the situation. Mr Tom Barrack, Mr Trumps special envoy for Syria, said the US and its allies were ready to help efforts to de-escalate tensions between government troops and Kurdish forces, which include the SDF group. SDF head Mazloum Abdi said the government forces strikes and deployment of tanks had undermined the chances of reaching understandings, create conditions for dangerous demographic changes, and expose civilians trapped in the two neighbourhoods to the risk of massacres. Two government officials told Reuters that negotiations were under way over the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from the city. In a statement, the Syrian government said stability could not be achieved with weapons outside the authority of the state, adding the only solution was return of government control to preserve the unity of Syria. The Asayish, in a written statement, denied that its forces had requested safe passage and called instead on the Damascus government to withdraw its forces. Turkey said it stood ready to help Syria if asked. The attacks carried out against civilians in Aleppo have unfortunately exacerbated concerns about the true intentions of the SDF and created a pessimistic picture regarding peace efforts, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told a joint press conference with his Omani counterpart on Jan 8. The SDFs insistence on protecting what it has at all costs is the biggest obstacle to achieving peace and stability in Syria, Mr Fidan added. Turkey views the US-backed SDF, which controls swathes of northeastern Syria, as a terrorist organisation and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the integration agreement. The Kurdistan Regional Governments prime minister, Mr Masrour Barzani, said he was deeply concerned by attacks on Kurdish neighbourhoods in Aleppo, warning that targeting civilians and attempts to alter the areas demography amounted to what he described as ethnic cleansing. The SDF said Damascus evacuation warnings ahead of shelling could amount to forced displacement and war crimes under international humanitarian law. Kurdish-led authorities established a semi-autonomous administration in north-east Syria and parts of Aleppo during Syrias 14-year war and have resisted fully integrating into the Islamist-led government that took power after former president Bashar al-Assadwas ousted in late 2024. Damascus reached a deal with the SDF in 2025 that envisaged full integration by the end of 2025, but progress has been limited, with both sides accusing the other of stalling. The US has sought to mediate, holding meetings as recently as Jan 4, though those talks ended without tangible results.

REUTERS/Dawoud Abu Alkas",[],"GENEVA/CAIRO/JERUSALEM, Jan 7 - Israel said on Thursday it had barred entry to Gaza of foreign medical and humanitarian staff whose organisations were ordered to cease operations unless they register employee details with Israeli authorities and meet other new rules. Fearing a renewed humanitarian crisis if medical and aid services can suddenly no longer access war-shattered Gaza, some of the 37 international nongovernmental organisations that were ordered to halt work are weighing whether to submit staff names to Israeli authorities, two aid sources told Reuters. Three of the aid groups said their foreign staff were told by Israeli authorities this week they could not enter Gaza. Israels diaspora ministry, which manages the registration process, says the measures are meant to prevent diversions of aid by Palestinian armed groups. NGOs say sharing staff details poses too much of a risk, pointing to the hundreds of aid workers who were killed or injured during the two-year Gaza war. Israel has shared little evidence of aid being diverted in the Palestinian enclave, an allegation that was disputed in a U.S. government analysis. The diaspora ministry said that while the NGOs had been granted 60 days to conclude operations, the entry of foreign personnel into Gaza is not approved. It said international staff with approved organisations including the United Nations could continue work as usual. Three prominent global NGOs - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Medecins du Monde Suisse and the Danish Refugee Council - said their international staff were refused entry to Gaza this week. Foreign aid staff had generally been permitted to rotate in and out of Gaza since the start of the war. If we dont have somebody in a key position, such as the emergency coordinator in charge of operations, then we either have to compensate, or we have a gap in aid service, said Anna Halford, Gaza emergency coordinator at MSF. THE WHOLE SYSTEM BREAKS DOWN Israels government said some 23 aid groups had agreed to the new registration rules, meaning humanitarian goods will continue to get into Gaza. But a U.N.-led coordination body has said the international groups that have registered could meet only a fraction of the required humanitarian response in the devastated Gaza Strip, where homelessness and hunger remain rife. Some of the 37 banned groups operate specialised services like field hospitals, aid officials say. MSF bolsters six Gaza health ministry hospitals and runs two field hospitals. The Medicos del Mundo NGO screens Gaza residents for malnutrition and provides mental health services. Without nutritional staff doing the screening and primary healthcare centres doing the therapeutic feeding and referral of patients with severe malnutrition to in-patient care - the whole system breaks down, an aid source told Reuters. Fearing the loss of those essential services for Gazas two million residents, some aid groups are considering reversing course and agreeing to the new registration rules. The essence of the debate (for aid groups) is how to safeguard their principles, humanitarian standards, and the safety of the local staff while being able to continue the services, a senior aid source said. COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry unit that controls access to Gaza, said the NGOs conduct raises suspicion regarding the parties with whom they operate in Gaza, but they remained free to register with the diaspora ministry. EVERYTHING IS MISSING Samira al-Ashqar, 40, who fled her Beit Lahia home to Al-Ansar camp in north Gaza with her disabled husband and nine others during the war, depends on Oxfam - one of the aid groups facing an Israeli ban - for food and financial support. Now, after the war, everything is missing, and things have become dire ... If these institutions were to stop, the people of Gaza would face complete devastation, al-Ashqar said. Mohamed Abu Selmia, head of Gazas Al Shifa Hospital, told Reuters the banning of groups like MSF could affect hundreds of thousands of people. The Israeli occupations decision comes at a time of unprecedented deterioration in health conditions. We suffer acute shortages of medication that reach 100% in some areas, and 55% overall, he said. MSF said an Israeli ban could also mean that foreign aid groups would no longer be able to pay local staff in Gaza because Israel could block bank transfers.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would withdraw from dozens of international and U.N. entities, including a key climate treaty and a U.N. body that promotes gender equality and womens empowerment, because they operate contrary to U.S. national interests. A large number of the 31 U.N. entities on the U.S. list are funded by the regular U.N. budget, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, adding that the U.N. has not received any formal notification from the Trump administration. He noted the U.S. had listed some treaty organizations that it plans to withdraw from, which would require official letters. All United Nations entities will go on with the implementation of their mandates as given by member states, Dujarric said. The United Nations has a responsibility to deliver for those who depend on us. The United States is the top contributor to the U.N. regular budget, paying the maximum 22% according to assessments agreed upon by the General Assembly. These payments are mandatory. The U.S. made no payments to the regular budget last year, Dujarric said. Washington currently owes some $1.5 billion. Assessed contributions to the United Nations regular budget and peacekeeping budget, as approved by the General Assembly, are a legal obligation under the U.N. Charter for all member states, including the United States, Dujarric said. The regular budget - which for 2026 is $3.45 billion - includes political, humanitarian, disarmament, economic, social affairs and communications work. Contributions to most U.N. agencies, funds and programs - such as the World Food Programme and childrens group UNICEF - are voluntary. Trump has described the U.N. as having great potential but said it is not fulfilling that. He wants to slash U.S. funding. Guterres launched a reform task force in March, known as UN80, which seeks to cut costs and improve efficiency.

Forum: Ensuring accessible and fair resolution of workplace discrimination,"Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Ministry of Manpower', 'Employers']","We refer to the commentary Taking employers to task over discrimination: How easy is the legal process? (Dec 29) by Ms Sugidha Nithiananthan and Ms Caitlin C. Fernandez, and Ms Mizue SaucosForum letter, Improve access to justice at the Employment Claims Tribunal (Jan 6). The Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Act provides a structured avenue for redress starting with direct engagement between parties. If resolution fails, mandatory mediation follows before a case can proceed to adjudication. This tiered approach emphasises amicable outcomes to preserve workplace harmony. The Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) offers a simplified and guided process that is accessible, affordable, and expeditious with safeguards against frivolous claims. The Acts framework does not permit legal representation at the ECT; however, workers and employers may seek legal advice outside proceedings or assistance through their respective unions. Judges in ECT proceedings proactively identify relevant issues and see that pertinent evidence is presented. To assist litigants who may not be legally trained, registrars will provide procedural guidance. As Ms Sauco notes, self-presented parties may apply for family members or friends to provide non-legal support during hearings, via the Community Courts and Tribunals Friend Scheme. More details are available on theSG Courts website (self-help guides). The decisions of the ECT – as courts of law – must be grounded in evidence where parties must prove their case. These procedural rules are essential to ensure that credible evidence is presented and that employers and workers are treated equally. The ECT ensures due process through a rigorous procedure and has maintained a consistent pace in doing so. While the duration between the filing of the claim and the first case management conference varies, most cases continue to be concluded within six months, notwithstanding a 67 per cent increase in claims between 2021 and 2025. The judiciary continues to refine its processes to remain user-centric and accessible, including modernising digital platforms for audio and video evidence submission. Workplace discrimination cases can be complex, and public awareness and education are key. The Ministry of Manpower and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices are stepping up public outreach and education efforts, including the development of a handbook to provide clear and practical guidance to help employers and workers understand and apply the law in the workplace.

Forum: Singapore Biennale deserves structural support,"Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Singapore Biennale', 'Arts festivals']","I refer to the Opinion article Time to shut down the Singapore Biennale? (Jan 6). The issue is less about artistic outcomes than about how leadership, responsibility and planning are organised around one of Singapores key public instruments for contemporary thought and expression. A biennale is more than a periodic exhibition. It shapes how a nation articulates ideas, participates in regional and international artistic discourse, and builds confidence in its public voice. In a city state such as Singapore, it also contributes to how civic identity is represented in the public sphere. Now in its eighth edition, the Singapore Biennale is no longer an emergent project. By this stage, it should have consolidated lessons learnt, strengthened institutional capability, and developed a clearer long-term trajectory. If structural constraints persist, the question is not whether the Biennale holds value, but whether its organisational model is carrying the responsibility expected of a national initiative of this scale. The Biennale should serve as a focal platform, offering a publicly accessible space for artistic inquiry where imagination and spectacle do not eclipse meaning, while anchoring and lending coherence to arts events and practitioners that strengthen the marketplace and professional ecosystem. This includes the work of art fairs, private galleries, independent institutions, art colleges, and self-organised artists and curators. At present, both the Singapore Biennale and the national pavilion at the Venice Biennale sit within a single museum structure whose mandate already spans research, collections oversight and institutional programming. Concentrating these responsibilities within one framework stretches capacity and constrains leadership renewal. It also limits the circulation of curatorial perspectives outside institutional and academic frames, where ideas can be more agile and more closely attuned to artistic practice, as well as to social and global contexts. A more resilient and future-oriented model would be a dedicated Biennale Office operating alongside but not subsumed into any single institution, supporting continuity across editions, strengthening regional and international partnerships, and cultivating sustained patronage in support of its public mission.

He astutely observed that the zone has moved beyond concept to meaningfully capture investor attention, serving as a litmus test for ASEANs ability to build resilient, border-transcending growth. Indeed, the JS-SEZ has evolved into a major regional priority, attracting significant investment. It represents a modern economic model, moving beyond cheap labour to prioritise proximity, resilience and sustainability. The complementary strengths of Singapores global connectivity and Johors land and manufacturing base create a powerful formula for supply-chain security, allowing companies to withstand global shocks. But as Mr Dujacquier noted, the real test lies in execution, not ambition. Physical bridges like the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link are crucial, but the bureaucratic bridge of regulatory alignment is paramount. The formidable challenge is not infrastructure, but harmonising rules and processes. History shows incentives alone cannot compensate for weak fundamentals. To succeed in the long term, the JS-SEZ must adopt transformative measures. There needs to be a joint statutory authority with the power to fast-track approvals, and a regulatory sandbox for innovation. A digital-first border with seamless biometric clearance and shared platforms must be built, making the crossing feel invisible and turning pilot schemes into reality. Critically, success depends on people. A shared skills and innovation corridor is essential to prepare the workforce for the 400,000 high-income jobs that the JS-SEZ is aiming to create. A future skills fund can ensure inclusive growth by upskilling locals, mitigating social risks like housing affordability. Furthermore, investment incentives should be tied to tangible outcomes like high-quality job creation, and not just be blanket tax holidays. The ultimate measure of success will not be short-term factory counts, but whether in 15 years, the border feels like a seam within a single, fluid and globally competitive ecosystem.

The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a voluntary retirement savings scheme that complements the Central Provident Fund (CPF) system. It already offers generous tax benefits to encourage savings. Contributions to SRS are eligible for tax relief, and when withdrawals are made on or after the applicable statutory retirement age, only 50 per cent of the withdrawn amount is subject to tax. Under the current framework, SRS members with no other taxable income may withdraw up to $40,000 per year tax-free. Over the 10-year withdrawal period, an SRS member can withdraw up to $400,000 without incurring any tax. This feature ensures that SRS provides meaningful tax concessions, while maintaining consistency with Singapores progressive tax system. Those who prefer longer streams of income may consider topping up their CPF accounts to obtain higher lifelong payouts through CPF LIFE, or purchase life annuities using SRS monies. Life annuities are exempt from the 10-year rule, as they provide lifetime payouts, which other dividend-paying investments may not. Over the years, the Government has made refinements to the SRS, including increased contribution caps and more flexible withdrawals in the form of investments.

Over 130 original paintings and sculptures by the Colombian, some over 3m tall, can be seen at Gardens by the Bay during Singapore Art Week that begins on Jan 22. Jointly presented by the Fernando Botero Foundation and IMBA, a new immersive arts theatre at Gardens by the Bay, Botero In Singapore is pitched as a first-of-its-kind landmark showcase for the late South American artist, who died in 2023. It marks thedebut of the new spacefeaturing a black box of more than 20,000 sq ft enclosed by a 12.5m-high projection wall, and which is expected to eventually become a year-round venue for arts and culture events. The exact dates and duration of the exhibition are being confirmed. But visitors can expect 118 paintings, drawings and indoor sculptures that span Boteros 70-year career. These include intimate studies and watercolours that pre-date his distinctive Boterismo style – exaggerated proportions that nevertheless treated his round figures with grace and sensuality, and a touch of pop art without the cynical consumerism. The outdoor gardens will become the verdant surroundings to another 10 of Boteros iconic supersized sculptures, including one of his go-to motifs, Horse. They add to Boteros existing landmarks, like his bronze Bird near UOB Plaza in Raffles Place and and Dressed Woman at Parkview Square, to transform Singapore into the Botero capital of the world. The artists eldest son Fernando Botero Jr, 69, tells The Straits Times in Mexico City in December, where he lives, that this may already be an unofficial status that Singapore holds. His father moved to Mexico in 1956 to learn from artists like Diego Rivera and it was there that he eventually had his eureka moment for his Boterismo style at 24, while painting a guitar at 2am. Mr Botero Jr says: Singapore has the highest concentration of Botero per capita. There was already a very large base of Botero collectors that had started buying Botero in the 1990s. They continued to buy when he exhibited at the Singapore Art Museum in 2004 and when he had an exhibition of monumental sculptures in Orchard Road. He is one of the most well-known artists in Singapore and thats quite amazing. My father loved Singapore. He always said, Ive managed to create a language that is so universal that my work is admired on the other side of the world. Mr Botero Jr, the former national defence minister of Colombia, suggests this unlikely love affair could have begun when Botero exhibited his giant sculptures in Ginza in Tokyo in the 1990s, which became the gateway to Boteros art for some Singapore collectors. Origins aside, it has become clear to him that Asia as a whole has become one of Boteros most staunch supporters. A Beijing exhibition of Botero in 2015 and early 2016 was visited by a record 1.5 million people. Mr Botero Jr had expected about 50,000 visitors for the entire run. Then they called us and said they had 30,000 visitors in one day. Unbelievable, he recalls. The family came to the inescapable conclusion that the second half of 2025 and first half of 2026 had to be entirely devoted to the continent: an exhibition in Guangzhou just wrapped, with Seoul and Taiwan shows next. After that, we have invitations from Europe and the Middle East, so were trying to balance between the West and the East, he says. Almost everything he painted is what he remembered from his childhood, because he left his home country when he was 18 and never went back. But it creates emotion for people from all over. Most art is national. There are maybe 10 or 15 artists – like Picasso, Warhol, Basquiat – who are truly universal. On Gardens by the Bay, he adds: My father believed very strongly that art should go to the public instead of the public going to art. Gardens by the Bay was ranked the eighth-best attraction in the world, which is huge. Maybe you dont realise in Singapore, but theres not a single tourist who goes to Singapore who doesnt go there. To have it easy for people to attend is in line with my fathers philosophy. For this Singapore iteration, Mr Botero Jr is also experimenting with an immersive format that is IMBAs strength. He narrates a 45-minute audiovisual account and shares stories of the artist as a father and the struggle and humour behind his masterpieces. His father spent his early life mired in poverty, but became increasingly successful from his mid-30s and was world-famous by his 40s. From 10am to 8pm daily, he worked alone in his studio and stayed uncontactable before emerging for lively conversation at dinner, a habit he shares withsurrealist Salvador Dali. He was a monk until 8pm and then he came alive, Mr Botero Jr says. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of art because thats the only thing that interested him profoundly. He could tell you the name of Cezannes wife, how many times Picasso got married, the names of the children of the artists. It was fascinating to talk to him. To whet peoples appetites, five works by Botero have also been placed at Shangri-La Singapore until March 1, which can be paired with a Botero-Inspired Afternoon Tea at the hotels The Rose Veranda. Botero In Singapore is supported by the Singapore Tourism Board, Panasonic Projector & Display, car dealer Eurokars and Shangri-La Singapore. IMBA will also host the upcoming South-east Asia premiere of English painter David Hockney: Bigger & Closer (Not Smaller And Further Away). This is an immersive experience with no original works – fitting, perhaps, with the artists latest penchant for iPad drawings.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/arts/130-botero-works-at-gardens-by-the-bay-during-singapore-art-week-worlds-largest-showcase

Start your Lunar New Year celebrations on the right note with the perfect steamboat pot. Whether you prefer simmering a traditional hot pot, grilling meat on a BBQ pan on the side or both, there is a surely one out there suited to your needs. If you are hosting a Chinese New Year gathering, browse this guide to find the best steamboat pot and make your festive meals more enjoyable. How to choose the best steamboat pot Where to find affordable steamboat pots in Singapore Best yuan yang steamboat pots Best BBQ and steamboat pots Best classic steamboat pots More steamboat accessories you can buy With so many steamboat pots on the market, it can be difficult to choose which one to buy. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the best steamboat pot for you. Having a too-small steamboat pot when hosting a big group might mean youll spend more time cooking multiple batches of food than eating. Choosing one that is too large would require you to wait for a long time for your broth to boil. For one to two people:As a rule of thumb, a 2.5-litre pot is great for solo dining or a two-person hotpot meal. For three to five people:A 4.5-litre steamboat pot can comfortably accommodate up to five people. For more than five people:If you are hosting a large group and want a large pot, do be mindful that you may need a steamboat pot with higher wattage. Alternatively, you could set a large pot on top of an induction cooker to cook your food instead. Yuan yang divider:For those who enjoy variety or have friends and family with different dietary preferences, a yuan yang pot allows you to enjoy two flavours at once. Temperature control:Being able to regulate heat over a large and precise range translates to having greater control over your cooking. Removable pot:If the pot can be separated from the cooking base, cleaning up becomes a lot easier. Cool-touch handles and surfaces:Some hotpots have cool-touch surfaces so you can safely move the pot around. BBQ grill option:Some hotpots have a BBQ grill attached to them, which is ideal for those who like the option of cooking food two ways with just one set up. Most steamboat pots on the market are either made of stainless steel or come with a non-stick coating. Stainless steel:If you want food to be cooked quickly or are opting for a larger pot, stainless steel may be a better choice as the material heats up quickly. However, food may stick to the pots surface. You also have to be careful not to touch the pots surface while cooking to avoid accidental burns. Non-stick coating:Cookware with non-stick coating allows for easy cleanup. But you must be mindful not to scratch the non-stick coating. Additionally, the coating degrades over time. Take note of sales such as Chinese New Year sales or double-digit day sales to buy home and kitchen appliances at a discount.

Whereas steamboat is more commonly used in Southeast Asia, primarily in Singapore and Malaysia; steamboat and hotpot are often used interchangeably in this region. For steamboats, lighter soups are used to cook fresh ingredients such as vegetables and seafood. Meanwhile, hot pot can include spicy and intense flavours. Some popular hotpot ingredients include thinly sliced pork belly, enoki mushroom, prawn, tofu, cabbage and egg. Steamboat soup can be healthy if you pick clear broths or choose soups that have low amounts of saturated fats and low sodium levels.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/bbq-and-steamboat-pot-cny-dinner-deals

Were chefs always this wild? The colourful backstories behind Culinary Class Wars 2,"Jan 08, 2026, 01:59 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 04:19 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/45c8007fa66e06cc9724e3daa05676696c8f884e02eac7fa72b26546961fe74d,"Chef Son Jong-won (standing, left) face off a Black Spoon contender in Culinary Class Wars 2.PHOTO: NETFLIX","['Korean food', 'South Korea', 'Chefs']","SEOUL – War zones, burned kitchens and death from malnutrition were among troubles that lay on life paths of South Koreas culinary elite. The most surprising thing about Netflixs smash-hit culinary survival series Culinary Class Wars (2024 to present) may not be the food or the final rankings, but the stories of each chef. Season 2s beloved judges and the white team – the elite figures who helped shape South Koreas contemporary culinary scene – make their on-screen entrances like kings. Yet behind the status and the Michelin credentials is something far messier and more cinematic than any edited competition show: a motley crew of runaways, war veterans, dropouts, and even accidental TV champions whose applications began after getting drunk. If Culinary Class Wars has a face, its Anh Sung-jae, the polite yet sharp-tongued judge whose intense gravitas defines the series. The owner of South Koreas sole three-Michelin-star restaurant, Mosu, Anh anchors the series with a well-mannered demeanor and piercing critiques. However, before reaching the summit of South Koreas culinary world, he led a chaotic life. Born in South Korea and raised in California, Anhs youth was defined by immigrant survival. His family struggled, moving between small businesses such as sock shops, T-shirt stores and an American-Chinese restaurant, with Anh helping before and after school. As a young adult, he enlisted in the US Army and served four years as a maintenance technician that included a yearlong deployment to Iraq. My assignment wasnt to fire a gun, but to search for weapons in Saddam Husseins bunkers and take them into the desert to detonate them, he revealed via an interview. He kept the deployment a secret from his family, an omission that earned him a slap from his furious grandmother upon his return, Anh added. Upon discharge, the transition to civilian life was equally impulsive; after spotting students in chef whites at Le Cordon Bleu, he abandoned plans to become a Porsche mechanic and enrolled on a whim. He began washing dishes, gradually moving up the restaurant ranks to eventually master the line at one of the US most-respected restaurants, The French Laundry and ultimately launching the historic Mosu in 2015. From war machines to haute cuisine, Anhs career has been an odyssey. Fan favorite Choi Kang-rok, beloved for his shy, anime-loving, otaku-like demeanor, also has an unusually unplanned career arc, one rarely seen even in Japanese comics. He began as a drummer, but after failing his music entrance exams, he enrolled in college to take Spanish studies. But he dropped out, drifting between part-time kitchen jobs to pay for his expensive music gear. It was during this period that he discovered the manga, Mr. Sushi King, reportedly the turning point that inspired him to officially start a career as a restaurateur. His early ventures were failures. Two sushi shops folded, leaving him broke and disillusioned. He lived in a Buddhist temple before moving to Japan to attend the prestigious Tsuji Culinary Institute, driven by a tenacious desire to break through in the culinary world. Even then, success proved elusive, and he retreated into a salaried job at a tuna trading company to settle his debts. It was only during a night of heavy drinking that he impulsively applied for Season 2 of MasterChef Korea. It was no drunken mistake: He won the series. Today, Choi stands as one of the shows most admired figures, his rise testament to the idea that talent will survive misfortune and emerge in time. Son Jong-won, the handsome heartthrob of the season, appears to embody elegant, controlled excellence, but his volatile past suggests otherwise. A valedictorian at an elite private school, Son seemed destined for a life of conventional success. On paper, his future was set, winning a scholarship at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Yet a visit to the prestigious Culinary Institute of America sparked an obsession that changed everything. After being captivated by students in crisp chef whites mastering their craft, Son made a decisive shift - abandoning his original major to enroll at the institute a and pursue a culinary career in the United States. He later returned to South Korea to helm LAmant Secret, earning a Michelin star within two years. He would then go on to take over Eatanic Garden at Josun Palace, which soon followed suit. Sons bold decision to walk away from a secure future proved decisive, shaping him into one of the countrys most beloved star chefs. Lim Sung-geun, the gruff, larger-than-life figure became one of the most popular memes of Culinary Class Wars Season 2, came to cooking not by choice but by running away from home. Having run away from home at 15, Lim survived by sleeping in kitchens and washing dishes. Working throughout his teenage years and quickly recognised for his talent, Lee became a head chef at just 19 - a self-taught master who practiced in secret at dawn, hiding the spoiled ingredients he used for training. His continued career in Korean cuisine is defined by a resilience that seems almost unreal: The night he achieved a tearful victory on the TV show Korean Food Battle 3 was the same night his three-story restaurant completely burned to the ground – events that unexpectedly cemented his status as a rockstar chef in the country. Perhaps the most striking presence on Culinary Class Wars is the Venerable Seonjae - serene, unshakable and dressed in monastic robes. But her origin story has a twist: She was a devout Protestant at first. Born into a Protestant family, she revealed she had attended mission schools, dawn prayers and Sunday teaching during her youth – a level of devotion rare even among committed Christians today. Her drastic conversion to Buddhism came during a retreat at Yongjusa Temple, alongside a spiritual awakening that reframed her idea of sacrifices and love. Ordained at 25, she was eventually confronted by a systemic failure: The death of a fellow monk from malnutrition, which led her on a quest to study Buddhist culinary practices. Her pursuit of an answer led her to publish South Koreas first academic thesis on temple cuisine and establish the Seonjae Temple Food Culture Research Institute. Today, she is recognised as the countrys first Master of Jogye Order Temple Food as well as a formidable contestant on Culinary Class Wars.

"Peace, love and Yeti: 5 ways to interpret Pantones colour of the year, Cloud Dancer, for 2026","Jan 08, 2026, 01:50 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 06:11 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/040d4879729164c72953e4db200b9f78a4dc7d02bc08d6d94e12e2184c315036,"Pantone said Cloud Dancer, also known as Pantone 11-4201, has an aerated presence which acted as a whisper of calm and peace in a noisy world.PHOTO: FERRAGAMO, BOTTEGA VENETA, IN GOOD COMPANY","['Shopping', 'Luxury brands', 'Fashion designers']","SINGAPORE – Colour authority Pantone made its most controversial prediction yet when it named white the colour of 2026. Since 1999, the firm behind the universal colour glossary, the Pantone Matching System, has tipped one shade that everyone will be wearing, using or generally coveting each year. Whereas past picks tended more colourful, like 2025s Mocha Mousse or 2020s Classic Blue,its money this time is onCloud Dancer. Pantone 11-4201 is, however you slice it, a standard-issue white. Its all-purposeness has split observers. The colour symbolising light in the cosmic battle between good and evil is a semiotic Swiss Army knife. One can plausibly read into it elitism for its association with ivory, a coded promotion of white eugenics or, in its safe blankness, a kind of timid fence-sitting in a politically divisive world. Others see the relatable yen for calm or a clean slate. The airy choice is a conscious statement of simplification, said Pantone Colour Institute executive director Leatrice Eiseman in a statement that referred to a cacophonous and overwhelming world. It also mixes well with all other colours, supporting rather than shouting, states the institutes vice-president Laurie Pressman in an article on the firms website. Local fashion designer and stylist Josiah Chua welcomes the pick, which he says feels like a collective reset. After seasons saturated with brights and high-impact hues, this soft white washes everything back to calm, allowing space to breathe, reflect and begin again, he says. However you lean, the debate over whites abstract properties feels strikingly of the moment. As chief fashion critic of The New York Times Vanessa Friedman puts it:So maybe Pantone got the choice right, even if the reasons they named (calm, restoration) were not entirely convincing? The colour institutes yearly bets have a mixed track record. For every hit like 2020s perceptive blue – that, in its likeness to the lurid blue of Big Tech logos, presciently distilled the onlineness of the pandemic year – there have been misses. For instance, 2024s Peach Fuzz was drowned out by the brash lime green of British musician Charli XCXs hyperpop album Brat that inspired the years revelrous Brat summer. But since most already own white pieces, the cost of given that most already own pieces in classic white, the practical cost of hopping on the Pantone wagon is nil. It is also a helpful canvas, never boring when styled with confidence, says Chua. Accents of your favourite brights, metallics or subtle stipples of colour can be woven in through accessories, embellishments or unexpected detailing, he adds. The heap of associations bound up with white also means it is ripe for personal interpretation. In the spirit of new year, new me, Pantones chosen shade is a pliant springboard for a range of fresh personas one might be tempted to try on in 2026. With Cloud Dancer and its Pantone trademark set to appear on everything from apparel and Motorola smartphones to Play-Doh and Mandarin Oriental hotels, here are five style tropes to play with, inspired by the potential new colour for our times. In its vanilla connotations, white can feel like a safe choice. But the colour of frost can carry attitude too. There is something autocratic about a stark white, which makes the wearer feel aloof and dramatic. That kind of coolness might be read as unsociable, but its hardness is attractive too,and somewhat tempered by the wearers vulnerability to stains. It is difficult to keep up a tough exterior after all. The chilly glamour of an all-white or mostly-white look is appropriate for those seeking to steel themselves in the new year. It telegraphs discipline and sureness, with a side of villainya la the White Witch of Narnia. The wintry sentiment can also serve as a reminder to take the temperature down in 2026 and avoid hot-headed reactiveness. Play with textures to elevate an all-white look. Chua suggests flourishes like white feather trims at the cuffs or devore (a technique used on velvet) fabrics. Ferragamo High-Slit Pencil Skirt, $1,520 A classic silhouette disrupted by dangerous slits. This mascarpone-hued pencil skirt is cut from pure virgin wool and features the Italian brands signature Hug buckle that accents the waistline.

This ensemble from Bottega Veneta was one of the 11 it presented. It mixes heavy and light fabrics, with a fluttering, asymmetric hem. Info:Available from end-February atbottegaveneta.com Reconciliation as a means of leaving behind quarrels past can feel particularly appealing in the new year. Those looking to retract their claws can draw from the universal symbol of peace, the white dove, by going for softer, inviting textures. Linen, knits or furry, swaddling materials spring to mind. Silky whites can add an adult element, to give pacifism without wimpiness. Colour-match with gentle blues and greys, as recommended by Pressman on Pantones website, to convey clear skies and the tranquillity of choosing peace. Rye Open Back Draped Funnel Neck Topin white, $169 This top is made of fluid acetate, a silk-like material with a natural sheen. The ties at the back can be cinched into a bow or left hanging for a more relaxed look. Info:Back-order available atr-y-e.co Edition Wool Off-Shoulder Sweater, $665 A cosy option for bundling up on cool days or in the office. Bare shoulders keep the look feminine. Info:Available at 01-34 Raffles City, 252 North Bridge Road Bridal white can come with baggage, like the oppressive ideal of purity. But the wedding gown also happens to be an enduring object of cultural fascination, with high-fashion designers traditionally closing their fashion shows with a bridal look. These can be subversive, like the feat of performance art that closed Alexander McQueens Spring/Summer 1999 show: a bouncy white dress worn by supermodel Shalom Harlow standing on a rotating platform as robotic arms spray-painted it with streaks of black and yellow – a milestone in fashion history. Still, the conventional idea of a blushing bride, excited and vulnerable as everyone in love is, can feel like an uplifting costume for those looking to lean into that mood. In love with the years possibility? White looks great when silky and pretty. Lace accents or a pleated garment could add that touch of romance to your wardrobe. Comme des Garcons Rose Applique Pinafore, $845 A dress serving a strong dose of avant-garde femininity. The rose appliques across the bodice are applied by hand, featuring the Japanese brands signature deconstructed approach to romantic elements. Info:Available atclub21.com In Good Company Tri Acetate Opera Dress, $339 This refined showstopper was the finale look at the local brands 2025 runway show at National Gallery Singapore. The silken finish, pared-back lines and statement cape command attention without doing too much – perfect for smart occasions, bar a wedding. Info:Available at B1-06 Ion Orchard, 2 Orchard Turn, andingoodcompany.asia The pristine focus of the scientist is embodied in the white laboratory coat, whose corporate form is the dress shirt. Running with this feeling in the new year could be good for those seeking to hunker down on a professional goal. Think of it as wearing your ambition on your sleeve. This could look like a straightforward crisp white button-down or dressy shirt that you make your new uniform. But for those afraid of looking too clinical, the key lies in texture and silhouette, advises Chua. He suggests blending opposites, like layering sheer pieces against structured ones, pairing matt finishes with lustre, or contrasting fluid forms with architectural cuts. With Nothing Underneath The Boyfriend shirt, $168 This essential white shirt is made of fine poplin for a smooth finish. It is tailored for women, flattering the collarbones and featuring a slightly dropped shoulder. Good for work and play. Info:Available atwithnothingunderneath.com Sabrinagoh Bria Top, $159 This top boasts subtle detail and dimension, with a loose yet structured fit in the extended shoulder line. Its overlapped front with alternating pleats along the button placket adds unflashy interest and makes it a prime uniform candidate. Info:Available at 03-33 Raffles City, 252 North Bridge Road, andsabrinagoh.com The mythical beast said to inhabit the Himalayan mountain range is the wildcard choice for rebels. If you are done with being a pipsqueak, lean into the untamed idea of the Abominable Snowman.

She has appeared in TV shows such as the Channel 5 drama 128 Circle (2019) and Channel 8 fantasy Fixing Fate (2025), as well as the Chinese New Year movie I Want To Be Boss (2025). She stars in A Good Fortune (2026), which opens in Singapore cinemas on Jan 29. Wong, who is in her early 40s, is also among the voice talents featured in the immersive virtual-reality experience VR60 – Experience Singapores Timeless Story, now on at creative lifestyle destination New Bahrus Lawn until March 29. This experience, which can be paid for using SG Culture Pass credits, uses storytelling, music and technology to bring Singapores cultural heritage to life. Wong, a descendant of the founder of Tai Thean Kew Circus, which operated here from the 1930s to 1980s, wrote a book on the circus history, Life Beyond The Big Top (2016), and is working on a short film based on it. I am very close to my grandmother, Madam Sze Ling Fen, who used to be an acrobat and tightrope walker with the Tai Thean Kew Circus. I grew up watching her rehearse and sew costumes at home for shows, well into her 50s. Now at 92, with diabetes and knee problems, she prefers not to venture too far from her neighbourhood. A fun weekend for me would be taking her out of her comfort zone to what I call trendy experiences, which are new, fun and exciting. I want her to enjoy her golden years, and see Singapore in its glory today. For her most recent birthday in September 2025, we had dinner at the Haidilao restaurant at Plaza Singapura with my mother and younger sister one weekend. My grandmother typically does not tolerate the hustle and bustle of town, saying everything is loud and expensive. But I talked her into experiencing the wonderful service and fun Haidilao is known for. I asked the restaurant in advance for the full Haidilao birthday experience. So, the staff wished her happy birthday upon arrival and decorated our private corner with balloons and glowing lights. One staff performed the noodle dance – stretching dough and twirling it into noodles – to Gangnam Style (2012) by South Korean rapper Psy. When it was time to sing the birthday song, the staff wheeled in a birthday cake with a glowing LED board, all the while clapping and singing. My grandmother was entertained by the celebration and said it was such a thrill. Given her circus career, I also take her to catch circus acts whenever they perform here on weekends, such as Cirque du Soleil – Kooza in 2017 and Lai Frisque Yi Xia Leh! in 2024. I also plan to take her to see Kooza again when it returns in February 2026. Seeing her smile makes me happy, and is the best part of my weekends.

Kicking things off is home-grown lingerie label Perk by Kate (PBK) and art label Studio Qiling, back in partnership for a second year running. The collaborative print for 2026 transforms peaches and fans into wearable art across printed bras, bra tops, scarves and kimonos. The motif is built upon four festive symbols. Most prominently featured is the peach, an emblem of sweetness and longevity that also cheekily mirrors the natural fullness of the feminine body celebrated in PBK silhouettes. Gold ingots, reimagined as seeds, symbolise abundance and prosperity. Leaves, woven through the print, symbolise renewal, vitality and a life that blooms continuously. And fans, traditionally linked with grace and nobility, represent elegance and good fortune. The print comes in two colourways – Pink Peaches and Wine Peaches – found on the Mia Lucky Girl Padded Bralette ($69), Padded Crop Top ($89) and Cheeky bottom ($39). Also featured in the collection is PBKs first custom-embroidered lace.

Fresh Air: New management for multi-concept food venue Air CCCC in Dempsey,"Jan 08, 2026, 12:59 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 06:14 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1e4828a6da2e7112d820e1d61ff95c24f42205d3de2fcf6e14e9e9edf646cf7f,Chefs Will Goldfarb (left) and Matt Orlando in the kitchen at Air in Dempsey in a 2023 file photo.PHOTO: ST FILE,"['Food and drink', 'Restaurants/Eateries', 'Chefs', 'Sustainable living/development', 'Food and beverage sector']","SINGAPORE – Changes are afoot at Air CCCC, the multi-concept food venture in the Dempsey lifestyle enclave. Ebb & Flow, the restaurant group that runs restaurants such as Willow and Carlitos, is stepping in to take over the day-to-day running of the place. The founders – American chefs Will Goldfarb and Matt Orlando, and Mr Ronald Akili, co-founder of the Potato Head hospitality brand in Bali – are still expected to be involved in the business, says Mr Lim Kian Chun, 33, chief executive of Ebb & Flow. Air CCCC, which opened in 2024, is short for Awareness, Impact and Responsibility – Circular Campus and Cooking Club. It occupies a 4,000 sq m complex in Dempsey that used to be a clubhouse for civil servants. The venue, which cost a seven-figure sum to set up, offers accessible luxury. Chef Orlando, former head chef of Noma, ran Amass in Copenhagen for nine years before starting Air. He has returned to Copenhagen. Chef Goldfarb runs Room4Dessert and Powder Room in Bali, and is returning to run these businesses and other projects. The food at Air is acontinuation of what chef Orlando did at Amass – coaxing deliciousness from what others might throw away. At the restaurant, banana skins were used to make caramel and fish bones were transformed into noodles. That sustainability thread will continue when Ebb & Flow takes over the running of the venue in late January 2026. Mr Lim tells The Straits Times the place will continue as Air for five to six months before it morphs into a new concept in the second half of 2026. What shape that will take is still up in the air. It will be something that really stays true to the vision of Will and Matt, and the ethos that they have, he says. I think were lucky that theres such a great platform here. We have had a lot of talks about whats important to us in terms of sustainability, product quality, locally sourced ingredients, great cooking and accessible experiences. Ebb & Flow already has a presence in Dempsey. It recently opened Curlys, a grocery store and restaurant that sources products and ingredients from regional small and independent producers. Chef Goldfarb, 50, adds: What we both care about, and one of the reasons Im so confident in Ebb & Flow coming in, is we know theyre committed to providing and caring for guests in such a meaningful way; sharing this sense of hospitality and taking care of people, which at the end of the day is what restaurants are all about. The expansive Air space includes a garden with fruit, vegetables and herbs that leads to a lawn area that can accommodate up to 350 people. The two-storey building seats 45 on each level, and includes research space and room for cooking classes and talks. The management change has been in the works for a few months, say Mr Lim and chef Goldfarb. Chef Goldfarb adds: Its a small industry so we luckily found ourselves around a small table. Mr Lim feels Singapore diners are looking for the same thing theyve always been looking for, which is good hospitality, good food and a sense of community. And maybe now more so than previously, they are looking for good value. They want to feel like they get more than what they pay for, an experience that is worth the money. As long as you manage to meet those expectations, you can build quite a loyal customer base. Chef Goldfarb adds: I think the important thing in Singapore, especially these days, is to be flexible, to adapt and to make sure youre delivering a great product for the greatest number of people as possible. The end of 2025 and start of the new year have seen a flurry of changes in the Singapore restaurant scene. Year-end closures have included Chefs Tavern in Craig Road. The 96-seat restaurant opened in March 2025. Austrian chef Stephan Zoisl, who has started private-dining business Dinner by Chef Stephan, says in the restaurants farewell post on Instagram on Dec 31: After months of trying to hold on amid rising costs and mounting rental pressures, it became impossible for us to continue. What hurts the most is not being able to welcome you during the Christmas period. Knowing that many of you had plans, celebrations and moments you trusted us with, and having to cancel so suddenly, truly broke my heart. Spanish restaurant Sabio at Quayside Isle in Sentosa has also closed after 12 years. According to its Dec 31 farewell post on Instagram, the owners are actively looking for a new home for Sabio. The restaurant has an offshoot in Bangkok. Otherpreviously reported year-end closureshave included one-Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant Esora, Spanish restaurant Sugarra at Resorts World Sentosa and Asu at Labrador Nature Reserve. London pizza chain Pizza Express has closed its Millenia Walk and Scotts Square restaurants. The chain, which has more than 500 restaurants worldwide, still has a presence in Singapore, with outlets at Duo Galleria and The Star Vista. Home-grown coffee chain Kith, which had 10 cafes at its peak, is left with two, ST reported on Jan 7. The two remaining cafes, at Marina Square and New Bahru, are collaborations with edutainment childrens park brand Kiztopia. Despite the slew of closures, new restaurants continue to spring up in Singapore. Statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, which run to November 2025, show that 3,760 food businesses started up in 2025, with 2,861 winding down. The final tally is still to come. Correction note:In an earlier version of the story, we said that Air occupied a 4,000sq ft space.

Nvidia slid 2.2 per cent, Broadcom declined 3.2 per cent and Microsoft dipped 1.1 per cent. The S&P 500 technology index lost 1.5 per cent, leaving it down about 1 per cent so far in 2026, as investors grew more finicky about AI-related stocks whose valuations have been inflated by outsized gains in recent years. Alphabet gained 1.1 per cent the day after the Google parent surpassed Apple in market capitalisation for the first time since 2019, becoming the second-most valuable US company. The iPhone maker was down 0.5 per cent. While AI is still hot, there are going to be winners and losers, said Mr Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. Its become a show me sector. Show me how you monetise this. Show me if theres going to be a return on the capex youre putting into your development. Defence stocks gained after Mr Trump said the 2027 US military budget should be US$1.5 trillion, much higher than the US$901 billion approved by Congress for 2026. Lockheed Martin rose 4.3 per cent, Northrop Grumman added 2.4 per cent and Kratos Defence jumped 13.8 per cent. Some defence stocks fell in the prior session, after Mr Trump threatened to block defence contractors from paying dividends or buying back shares until they speed up weapons production. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly hit intra-day record highs on Jan 7, and valuations remained relatively high ahead of fourth-quarter earnings season. The S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, down from 23 in November, but above its five-year average of 19, according to LSEG data. The S&P 500 climbed 0.01 per cent to end the session at 6,921.45 points. The Nasdaq declined 0.44 per cent to 23,480.02 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.55 per cent to 49,266.11 points. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits rose moderately last week, though demand for labour remained sluggish, supporting Jan 7 ADP employment and JOLTS figures. Traders were focused on the Jan 9 crucial nonfarm payrolls report for December, which would be among the first reliable datasets after the longest US government shutdown in history. Fitch raised its US growth outlook, estimating GDP expanded 2.1 per cent in 2025 and forecasting 2 per cent growth in 2026 after incorporating economic data delayed by 2025s government shutdown. AI-related memory chipmakers lost ground after a stellar rally. SanDisk lost 5.4 per cent, Western Digital declined 6.1 per cent and Seagate fell 7.7 per cent. Ford jumped 4.7 per cent after Piper Sandler upgraded the automaker to overweight from neutral. Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 2.4-to-one ratio.

Paramount again tells Warner Bros its offer trumps Netflixs,"Jan 09, 2026, 03:57 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 03:57 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6d92a6679df1629dff61f67ef1da47d8c69075b77665a015942f2f8be7158f27,"CBS parent Paramount and online streaming giant Netflix have been in a heated battle for Warner Bros, whose extensive content library includes Harry Potter and the DC Comics universe.PHOTO: REUTERS","['United States', 'Acquisitions', 'Media', 'Streaming - music/video/content']","NEW YORK - Paramount Skydance on Jan 8 reiterated that its US$108.4 billion (S$139 billion) bid for Warner Bros Discovery was superior to a rival deal from Netflix, saying the value of the cable spinoff central to the streaming giants offer was effectively worthless. Warner Bros Discoverys board on Jan 7 rejected Paramounts amended hostile offer that included a US$40 billion in equity personally guaranteed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount chief executive officer David Ellison, and US$54 billion in debt. The CBS parent and Netflix have been in a heated battle for Warner Bros, its prized film and television studios, and its extensive content library that includes Harry Potter and the DC Comics universe. Paramounts argument - one it is using to sway investors - is that its all-cash US$30-per-share offer for the whole of Warner Bros is superior to Netflixs US$27.75 a share cash-and-stock deal for the studios and streaming assets and will more easily clear regulatory hurdles. The Netflix deal is worth US$82.7 billion. In its response on Jan 8, Paramount even went so far as to suggest that the cable properties of CNN and Discovery, which Netflix does not want, are effectively worth less than nothing, based on an equity valuation of the recently floated Versant Media, a Comcast spinoff that includes digital assets and TV channels such as CNBC. That stock has dropped 18 per cent since its market debut on Jan 5. That sour performance has given fresh ammunition to Paramounts campaign to convince Warner Bros shareholders its offer is better. On Jan 8, it said it values the Warner Bros cable spinoff at zero - or even less than that, due to its high leverage and lagging performance. While Discovery Global equity would have no equity value if the company trades in line with Versant, there are in fact several compelling reasons why it should trade at a discount to Versant, Paramount said on Jan 8. Paramount said the Netflix offer would reduce the cash paid to shareholders if Warner Bros loads more debt onto the merger. The company argues the cash payout could drop to US$20 per share, from the current offer of US$23.25, if Warner Bros were to adopt the leverage in line with Versant. Warner Bros did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Netflix cited its Jan 7 statement that its offer is the superior deal and will deliver the greatest value. Shares of both Warner Bros and Netflix were down nearly 1 per cent, while those of Paramount ticked up 0.6 per cent. It would be surprising if the shareholders were swayed by the argument because theyve likely already considered the declining value of linear TV assets when they agreed to split the company and sell the growing portion to Netflix, said Mr Ross Benes, senior analyst at eMarketer. But Paramount has a point - fading TV networks arent appealing to most investors. Paramounts tender offer will expire on Jan 21, but the company can extend it. Warner Bros has argued that Paramounts revised Dec 22 bid remains inadequate, citing uncertainty regarding the CNN parents ability to finalise the transaction, and the exposure of Warner Bros shareholders to significant risks and costs in the event of deal failure. The board said Paramounts offer hinges on an extraordinary amount of debt financing that heightens the risk of closing. Netflixs deal requires no equity financing and is backed by US$59 billion in debt from banks including Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas and HSBC Holdings. Warner Bros has also said it would owe Netflix a US$2.8 billion termination fee if it walks away from the agreement, part of US$4.7 billion in extra costs to end the deal. Paramount did not offer to cover the costs on Jan 8. Warner Bros chairman Samuel Di Piazza has said the company is not currently negotiating with Paramount but is open to a deal if Paramount can put something on the table that is compelling. Some Warner Bros investors, including the seventh-largest shareholder Pentwater Capital, have argued that the board was making a mistake not engaging with Paramount. For either suitor, winning shareholder support is only the first hurdle for a deal that would face tough scrutiny by the antitrust regulators in the US and Europe. Bipartisan lawmakers have raised concerns about the potential harm for consumers and creatives and US President Donald Trump has said he plans to weigh in on the deals. Paramounts bid will create a studio bigger than market leader Disney and fuse two major TV operators, which some Democratic senators say will control almost everything Americans watch on TV. For Netflix, a lightning rod in Hollywood over its streaming-first approach, the deal would cement its dominance with a combined 428 million subscribers. It has promised to honour Warner Bros theatrical commitments. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/paramount-again-tells-warner-bros-its-offer-trumps-netflixs
US trade gap shrinks to smallest since 2009 as imports fall,"Jan 09, 2026, 03:18 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 03:18 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cfee653355a21cefcbf54be90fdb987358f44c673f829c060f30041c42d1126c,"Shipping containers from China at the Port of Los Angeles, in San Pedro, California, in November 2025.PHOTO: REUTERS","['United States', 'US economy', 'Trade', 'Tariffs', 'Donald Trump']","WASHINGTON - The US trade deficit made a sharp and unexpected pullback in October, reaching its lowest level since 2009 as goods imports dropped while President Donald Trumps tariffs took hold, government data showed Jan 8. The overall trade gap plunged 39 per cent to US$29.4 billion (S$37.8 billion) in October, said the Department of Commerce, as imports dropped by 3.2 per cent. The deficit was significantly smaller than a US$58.4 billion median forecast from surveys of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. The release of the trade data was delayed by more than a month due to a lengthy government shutdown in 2025, depriving officials and companies of updated figures as they assess the health of the worlds biggest economy. While US exports rose by US$7.8 billion in October to US$302.0 billion, imports dropped by US$11.0 billion to US$331.4 billion. This was largely due to a tumble in goods imports. In particular, consumer goods declined US$14.0 billion and within the category, pharmaceutical preparations fell sharply, the Commerce Department said. Imports of industrial supplies and materials like nonmonetary gold also dropped. KPMG senior economist Meagan Schoenberger noted that nonmonetary gold made up a huge chunk of the export rise and a small part of the imports decline. The run-up in gold in 2025 has clouded the trade picture and during the month of October made the trade deficit look narrower than the remainder of the product mixture implies, she said in a note. But outside of that, the main contributors to declining imports were pharmaceuticals, which fell US$14.3 billion alone, Ms Schoenberger added. The sector has been very volatile since firms stocked up in early 2025, and could have been impacted by October trade policy announcements. Other areas that showed small declines included auto parts, oil and natural gas and fruits and vegetables, she said. Meanwhile, imports of high-tech capital goods continued their upward march given tariff waivers for the industry and the build-out of data centres to feed AI demand, she added. The figures underscore how, since returning to the presidency in 2025, Mr Trumpsfast-changing and sweeping tariff policieshave swayed trade flows. As the US leader unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on imports from various trading partners, businesses in the country rushed to stock up on inventory ahead of planned hikes in duties. This has allowed many firms to avoid passing on the full cost of tariffs to consumers, at least for now. As US households grapple with cost-of-living worries, Mr Trump has more recently broadened the range of goods exempted from certain tariffs – covering key agriculture imports. But many of these exemptions were due to take effect in November. As of mid-November, the Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate that is the highest since the 1930s. The US trade deficit was US$48.1 billion in September. Although Mr Trumps tariffs have influenced trade flows this year, a large swathe of them also face legal challenges. In particular, the Supreme Court isdue to rule on the legality of tariffsimposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, after hearing arguments in November. If the conservative-majority high court were to rule that the president overstepped his authority in imposing these duties, it could temporarily hit many country-specific tariffs – although not sector-specific ones.

Speaking at the Bank of Singapores 2026 outlook conference on Jan 8, Mr Chee, who is also deputy chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said there will be a chance of some rogue actors from time to time in any jurisdiction when embarking on a particular area. But the number has to be kept small, he told an audience of around 900 mostly private banking clients at the event, held at Marina Bay Sands. If the number grows too big, we have a problem. If we can do that (keep the number small), we can preserve that trust element and that trusted reputation while encouraging taking of calculated risk – what we call a risk-proportional approach – and encouraging innovation. It is also crucial to detect and deal with those rogue cases in a firm and decisive manner to give investors confidence, he noted. They choose Singapore because this is a place that can be trusted. This is a space that is stable, so we mustnt lose that, he said. If we end up compromising on our trusted branding, we have more to lose. So I would rather preserve that – but dont go for zero risk, because then you have no leeway to be able to innovate, to try new ideas. When banks give out loans or do business with clients, they cannot be 100 per cent certain that there would be no errors either, he noted. He said Singapore should not be only a place where it is safe to park money. It not only aims to attract family offices and entrepreneurs to grow ideas, talent and capital here, but also seeks to support those who wish to use Singapore as a philanthropy hub to do good and make a positive impact. Mr Chee also touched on stablecoins, saying that the Republic shouldview the digital asset in a balanced and sensible mannerand understand the value and safeguards behind it, while avoiding chasing after trendy developments. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a certain asset, such as fiat currencies. So how can Singapore position itself to be able to enter this space, knowing that there will be competition, whether it is from Hong Kong, Dubai... We have to be quite clear-eyed about it. It doesnt mean that we dont do anything, but it also doesnt mean that we want to do everything, he said. Singapore must not end up being pressured to do something out of a fear of missing out, because it may end up making the wrong decisions, he added. Addressing the wider region, he said ASEAN still has many untapped opportunities, such as its digital economy not realising its full potential. The individual ASEAN economies will all want to have their own development plans. I think thats fair... But it doesnt mean that we cannot build or facilitate smooth flow of payments in the digital economy. It can be done, he said. Theres still a lot of upside for us to further strengthen this. He also pointed to the ASEAN power grid initiative, saying that it will be a game changer if the region manages to carry it out successfully. The future of our economic development, whether its artificial intelligence centres, automation or manufacturing, you need clean, green power, and this is something which we wont be able to optimise for the whole region if (we) all do (so) by ourselves, but we really look at how we can integrate and do it together, he said. He also noted that the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone has allowed Johor and Singapore to look at a win-win outcome, but it should not be limited to just companies from Johor shifting to Singapore, or Singapore companies shifting to Johor. Thats not growth. Thats just reallocation. We should really be working together to try and attract new investments – investments that will otherwise not even consider coming to this part of the world. The tie-up between Johor and Singapore will offer investors the best of both worlds, he said, adding that many such opportunities in ASEAN are still untapped.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/spore-has-to-accept-risk-of-rogue-actors-to-prosper-as-a-wealth-hub-chee-hong-tat

This is a place to be, and the supply chain shifts are in favour of us. We are exporting a lot more to the US, selling to the rest of the world and also on our own, we have strong fundamentals – our population, our income growth – to support them, said UOB head of research Suan Teck Kin. Mr Suan, who was speaking at UOBs 2026 market outlook webinar on Jan 7, noted that ASEAN will continue to benefit from supply chain shifts and trading with China. He said: ASEAN will continue to benefit from these supply chain shifts, selling more to the US, selling more domestically. China, as well as the US and Europe, companies are shifting production. You can see that from the foreign direct investment data that these things are still evolving and developing in our favour, and China is doing a lot more with the region. As long as China is holding up, we should be able to benefit from Chinas continued growth. China has been ASEANs largest trading partner for over 16 years, while ASEAN has been Chinas top regional partner for the past five. Bilateral trade surged to nearly $990 billion in 2024, with projections exceeding $1 trillion by the end of 2025. Electrical machinery, mineral fuels and agricultural products are among key exports from ASEAN. Mr Suan noted that it was still business as usual for South-east Asia exports and imports despite threats from US tariffs in 2025. ASEAN also comes out top as an investor destination. ASEAN is top of the league in terms of foreign inflows in investment, he said, adding that investors tend to park money in Singapore because of its financial centre status. UOB estimates that prospects for ASEAN over the next five to 10 years are still positive. UOB senior foreign exchange strategist Peter Chia said that even against the backdrop of a US-China trade war and concerns of a China slowdown, most Asian currencies gained against the US dollar. Half of the battle was won because the US dollar was weak in the first place. But the gross domestic product profile for Asia was remarkable last year, with Singapores 4.8 per cent growth, and even China had met their target of 5 per cent last year. That has caused the Asian currencies to strengthen, he said. For Asian currencies, often they look towards the renminbi for leadership and the trade war was relatively short. So you can see that once the renminbi starts to stabilise, it also adds another dimension, or another source of support for Asian currencies to rally towards the end of the year. UOB Asset Management (UOBAM) on Jan 7 announced it is set to launch an ASEAN Dividend Index exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Jan 29. At the point of listing, it will be the only dividend-focused ASEAN ETF to be listed on the Singapore Exchange. As investors seek to enhance income and strengthen long-term total returns, ASEAN has emerged as an attractive destination for dividend strategies, supported by robust economic fundamentals and a broad base of companies with established dividend track records, the firm said. The region also offers a diverse mix of growth-oriented and established economies, creating opportunities for portfolio diversification across different market cycles, it added. The ETF counts local banks DBS, OCBC and UOB, and other notable names such as Malaysias Malayan Banking, Indonesian conglomerate Astra International and Thailands oil and gas company PTT, among its top constituents. UOBAM said the ETF is aiming to pay annual dividends of at least 6 per cent in 2026 and 2027.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/if-theres-any-place-in-the-world-to-do-business-in-2026-its-asean-uob-research-head
Chinas OpenAI rival Zhipu rises after $715 million IPO,"Jan 08, 2026, 01:15 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 04:37 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/2f54aeaa7bd16bbc72235b7569a547bf5f0c61784930467586150922cf8f64ad,Zhipu CEO Zhang Peng (left) and chairman Liu Debin at the companys listing ceremony at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Jan 8.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG,"['China', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'IPO']","SHANGHAI-Shares of Knowledge Atlas Technology gained on their Hong Kong debut, following a US$558 million (S$715 million) initial public offering (IPO) that made it the first major Chinese generative artificial intelligence (AI) start-up to go public. The stock rose as much as 16 per cent on Jan 8 to HK$135, rebounding after a muted open. The company, better known as Zhipu, offered 37.4 million shares at HK$116.20 apiece to investors last week. Its shares allocated to retail investors were subscribed by more than 1,159 times. Zhipu is the first of Chinas AI tigers – start-ups building large language models to rival OpenAI and Anthropic – to go public. Its listing offers an early test of whether markets view these firms as credible challengers to US counterparts. Despite strong investor interest in AI overall, Chinese software makers face unique operational hurdles, from US export controls that limit access to advanced chips to operating with far less capital and computing power than Silicon Valley developers. Chinese hardware makers have fared well in recent IPOs, supported by localisation demand that brightens the outlook for domestic chip and equipment suppliers. By contrast, Chinese software start-ups, especially in generative AI, encounter greater scepticism as they work to broaden their user base while contending with intense competition from both global rivals and local peers. The Chinese market is hyper-competitive, which naturally drags prices down to these levels, Zhipu co-founder and chairman Liu Debing said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. But as we compete globally, international users will undoubtedly recognise the value. Chinese companies prospects in international competition are underscored by their valuation gap with US peers. Anthropic, the AI start-up behind the chatbot Claude, is raising a new round of funding that would value the company at US$350 billion before the new investment. We have a positive view of this IPO, analyst Douglas Kim wrote in a note on Smartkarma, while assigning Zhipu a valuation of HK$223 per share based on a target price-to-sales multiple of 100 times – a 30 per cent discount to the peer average. Investor interest in the sector – while still robust as China continues to strengthen domestic capabilities – has been accompanied by an ongoing debate around the risk of an AI-related market bubble, said Fidelity International associate investment director Liu Minyue. Zhipus listing comes as Chinese semiconductor firms – a key component in the AI supply chain – are rushing to raise funds. Graphics processing units maker Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor also debuted on Jan 8, rising as much as 33 per cent. Zhipus local rival MiniMax Group is set to list on Jan 9 after a US$619 million IPO. Chip designer Shanghai Biren Technology made a strong debut last week, marking the best first-day performance since 2021 among major Hong Kong listings. Moore Threads Technology and MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai also soared on their listing day in Shanghai in December. Zhipus market capitalisation of US$6.6 billion based on the issue price values the company lower than chipmakers Biren, Moore Threads and MetaX. Zhipu, founded in 2019 by researchers from Chinas Tsinghua University, is celebrated as a pioneer in the nations AI industry. It is backed by Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and several local government funds. That support helped the company win contracts from state-owned enterprises, which prefer building customised AI infrastructure rather than tapping public cloud services. Zhipu mainly serves domestic institutions. The company reported revenue of 312.4 million yuan (S$57.3 million) in 2024. Zhipu plans to use 70 per cent of the IPO proceeds towards research and development of its general-purpose large AI models, according to its prospectus. China AI was the new narrative in 2025 and will likely be even stronger in 2026, Sanford C. Bernsteins analysts, led by Dr Qingyuan Lin, wrote in a note. The market has begun to recognise that Chinas AI development is only months behind global leaders.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/chinas-openai-rival-zhipu-rises-after-715-million-ipo

Hajar Abdelkader, competing under an Egyptian flag, lost 6-0 6-0 to German world number 1,026 Lorena Schaedel in 37 minutes at an International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament on Wednesday, winning only three points and committing 20 double faults. The 21-year-old amateur appeared unfamiliar with how to play the sport, landing fewer than one in 10 first serves and needing her opponent to direct her to the correct side of the court, as clips went viral with some calling it the worst-ever professional debut. Tennis Kenya, hosts of the event, said Abdelkader was given a last-minute wildcard after another player withdrew shortly before the tournament, looking to maintain a full and balanced draw. The decision, they said, was taken based on information provided by the player. In hindsight, this wildcard should not have been granted, Tennis Kenya said in a statement on Thursday. The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happens again. The Egyptian Tennis Federation distanced themselves from the debacle, telling the Daily Mail and BBC that Abdelkader is not registered with the organisation and played no role in her nomination or entry. They added that they had no further information about her tennis background, despite her ITF profile stating that she has played the sport since the age of 14. Tennis Kenya said they had contacted both players involved to offer support following the extent and nature of the coverage of the lopsided match, which was part of the entry level of professional tennis where events still award prize money and ranking points.

Real extended their advantage 10 minutes into the second half when Rodrygo latched onto an incisive pass from Valverde, broke clear of his marker and calmly side-footed past Oblak. Atletico hit back almost immediately, however, as Giuliano Simeone delivered a measured cross to the back post where Sorloth rose above Raul Asencio to head home and reduce the deficit three minutes later. Rodrygo almost scored his second to restore Reals two-goal cushion, only for Oblak to block his close-range effort, while Courtois denied Antoine Griezmanns acrobatic attempt and Marcos Llorente twice shot just wide, leaving Atletico unable to push the semi-final to penalties.

PSG looked to be cruising to victory after an early goal from Ousmane Dembele, who had also scored the late winner in last seasons 1-0 final victory over AS Monaco in Doha. However, Marseille stunned the French champions with two late goals to turn the game on its head. Mason Greenwood converted a penalty and a Willian Pacho own goal gave Marseille a shock lead. But PSG refused to be beaten, launching a wave of attacks that culminated in Goncalo Ramos snatching an equaliser in the final seconds to send the contest to penalties. Chevalier proved the decisive figure in the shootout, saving spot-kicks from Matt ORiley and Hamed Traore. Ramos, Vitinha, Nuno Mendes, and Desire Doue all converted for PSG to seal the win. Record 14-time winners PSG, who faced last seasons Ligue 1 runners-up Marseille after the Parisians had won both the league and the French Cup, won the competition for the 12th time in the last 13 years. The drama began early, with Chevalier forced into a seventh-minute save from a Leonardo Balerdi header before Nuno Mendes headed just wide at the other end. Dembele broke the deadlock in the 13th minute, latching onto a pass from Vitinha before lifting a left-footed shot over the keeper and into the net. Marseille responded, with Greenwood firing just over the bar before goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli denied Mendes. Chevalier was called into action again to thwart an effort from Emerson in the 34th minute. After the break, Chevalier produced a superb double save, first denying a dangerous header from Igor Paixao and then a powerful shot from Amine Gouiri less than two minutes later. The introduction of substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the 67th minute gave Marseille a boost, and they were awarded a penalty in the 74th minute when Greenwood was brought down by the keeper. The forward stepped up to level the score. Marseille thought they had won it in the 87th minute when PSG defender Pacho inadvertently turned a cross from Traore into his own net. However, in the fifth minute of stoppage time, a swift counter-attack led to Bradley Barcola heading a long ball into the path of Ramos, who made no mistake to send the game to penalties.

Joshua suffered minor injuries in the Dec 29 crash and after being discharged from hospital he returned to England before attending the funerals of Latif Ayodele and Sina Ghami on Dec 4. Thank you for all the love and care you have shown my brothers, Joshua posted on Instagram. I didnt even realise how special they are. Ill just be walking with them and cracking jokes with them, not even knowing God kept me in the presence of great men. 100 percent its tough for me, but I know its even tougher for their parents. I have a strong mind, and I believe God knows their hearts. May God have mercy on my brothers. Ayodele, the personal trainer of the former two-time unified heavyweight champion, and Ghami, Joshuas long-time strength and conditioning coach, both died at the scene of the crash on Dec 29. Nigerian police charged the driver of the vehicle, Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, with dangerous driving causing death. The accident took place on a busy highway linking Lagos and Ibadan in southwest Nigeria when the Lexus SUV in which they were travelling rammed into a stationary truck. Joshua, 36, who has family roots in Nigeria, was on holiday in the country following his win over Youtuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in Miami on Dec 19.

Defeat on Jan 7 left Tottenham in 14th place in the table, piling pressure on manager Thomas Frank, and disgruntled fans let the players know their feelings with the likes of Micky van de Ven and Pedro Porro involved in verbal exchanges. Argentinas World Cup-winning defender Romero apologised to the fans in a social media post and suggested it should not be the players having to front up to the supporters. We are responsible, theres no doubt about that. But we will keep facing up to it and trying to turn the situation around, for ourselves and for the club, he said. At times like this, it should be other people coming out to speak, but they dont -- as has been happening for several years now. They only show up when things are going well. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levystepped down as executive chairmanin September after 25 years with chief executive Vinai Venkatesham taking on the day-to-day running of the club. It was not clear who Romero was referring to in his Instagram post in which he apologised to the fans for another defeat in what is turning into a disappointing season. But the 27-year-old insisted the players will stick together and try to emerge from the current slump which has seen them win only twice in their last 12 Premier League games. Well stay here, working, sticking together and giving our all to turn things around, he said. Especially at times like this, keeping quiet, working harder and moving forward all together, is part of football. Tottenham manager Thomas Frank said Romero was a young leader who made a mistake, adding that it was better to deal with the clubs issues internally. The clubs sporting director Johan Lange and Frank had met with Romero to discuss the matter, the manager told reporters on Jan 8. When youre a young leader, sometimes you make a mistake. Its of course good to keep it internally. Johan and I had a good conversation with him this morning about everything. We keep it internally, he said.

Morocco have faced criticism for their form despite progressing comfortably to the last eight, finishing top of their group with seven points out of a possible nine and beating Tanzania 1-0 in the round of 16 at the weekend. Regragui has already warned supporters that top-ranked Morocco need to approach their matches with humility but their performances have drawn widespread scrutiny for being overly cautious. Speaking at a pre-match press conference, Regragui said the team remained confident despite feeling the pressure. We are still thinking the same way and have confidence in what we are doing, he told reporters. The players feel it and we know we have to live up to it. The most important thing is that the fans continue to support us. We have the humility to believe that we can win this Cup of Nations, he declared. Its a tournament that requires staying grounded, even if people do not want to understand that. But when you see the results and all the strong teams that have progressed, then you realise what you are up against. When Morocco last hosted the Cup of Nations in 1988, Cameroon knocked them out in the semi-finals and the two countries have a long history of fierce contests. This will be a clash that will reverberate around the continent. Cameroon needs no introduction. We know its going to be tough again, Regragui predicted. Morocco are unsure whether defensive midfielder Sofyan Amrabat will recover from injury in time after missing their last two games but attacker Hamza Igamane is available after missing the opening fortnight of the tournament with injury, the coach said.
