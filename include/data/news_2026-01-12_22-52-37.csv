"Food trails for kids, protein for seniors: How Sporeans are learning to live well and eat better","Jan 13, 2026, 04:00 AM","Jan 13, 2026, 04:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e16f0f37e1f6babe5678ad41dfa4b4fa9c0f0692529ff2666102476809cb7179,Good nutrition lays the foundation for healthy growth in children and supports strength and vitality in later life.PHOTOS: FAIRPRICE GROUP,"['Branded content', 'Senior citizens', 'Nutrition and diet']","A cluster of preschoolers hovered in the drinks aisle of aFairPrice supermarket– not to grab their favourite beverages, but to scan bottles for Healthier Choice Symbols and Nutri-Grade ratings, peering closely as they compared sugar levels. A few aisles away, curiosity was sparked again: Why are wholegrains healthier than white rice? At the fresh produce section, little hands reached out to touch and compare fruits and vegetables, turning the grocery run into a multi-sensory lesson on food and nutrition. Some even spotted the Marine Stewardship Councils Blue Fish Tick – an ecolabel for sustainably sourced seafood – a detail that did not go unnoticed by their teachers. They were incredibly observant and were able to interpret nutrition labels, such as spotting drinks with high sugar content, says Ms Alicia Khoo, a preschool teacher at My First Skool. Since the visit, some of the children have also been reminding their peers to eat their broccoli during meals as it will make them stronger, and have balanced meals with both meat and vegetables. It shows that hands-on experiences in a supermarket make lessons memorable and help children form strong connections with what they learn in class, she adds. My First Skool senior English teacher NurAmirah Jamaludin explains further: Even our younger Nursery 2 children were able to explain the different food groups introduced during lessons. During the session, they confidently grouped and classified various foods into their correct categories. The supermarket visit is part of Start Strong, Stay Strong, Singapores first preschool nutrition and sustainability education initiative by FairPrice Group andFairPrice Foundation. FairPrice Foundation is the philanthropic arm of FairPrice Group. Developed in partnership with sustainability social enterprise Terra SG, My First Skool by NTUC First Campus, and supported by nutrition knowledge partner KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, the programme was launched in 2024 and aims to reach up to 40,000 preschoolers by the end of 2028. One of the programmes key components is the Food Finder Adventure, an experiential trail through FairPrice supermarkets. After completing the trail, children receive a bundle of fresh fruits and breakfast essentials to enjoy at home, along with a recipe pamphlet featuring easy, affordable and healthy meals families can prepare together. For Ms Jamaludin, the impact of the supermarket experience goes beyond classroom learning and has translated into significant changes in her students eating habits. Children now encourage one another to eat more vegetables, often linking their meals back to theHealth Promotion Boards (HPB) My Healthy Plate framework, she says. Adds Ms Khoo: We have observed meaningful behaviour changes. While previously picky eaters still had preferences, they showed greater willingness to try small portions of new foods. The changes extend beyond school. Parents have shared that grocery trips are now more intentional, says Ms Jamaludin. Their children point out health labels before items go into the basket, turning routine shopping into something more interactive and educational for the whole family, she adds. Alongside the supermarket trail, children also take part in Healthy Plate Heroes, a gamified classroom session that introduces food groups and essential nutrients, as well as a Take-Home Mission – an interactive sticker pamphlet containing instructions for home activities that encourage the exploration of their households eating habits and dietary needs, guiding them and their families in making informed nutrition choices. Six-year-old Isaac Yap, who attends My First Skool, says his favourite part was learning about the nutrition labels. Now, when I go to the supermarket, I will ask my mummy to buy food with the Healthier Choice Symbol, he says. His mother, Madam Sim Lee Ong, has noticed a difference at home. Isaac now portions his rice, meat and vegetables carefully, applying what he has learnt through the programme. He has become our little health ambassador at home, she says. What Isaac is learning now, experts say, lays the foundation for health across a lifetime. Good nutrition is key to helping everyone – from a growing child, to a working adult and an elderly person – maintain healthy weight, keep up their immunity, promote recovery and keep muscles strong for day-to-day activities, says Ms Goh Yiting, senior dietitian at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). Young children, in particular, need more nutrition to support growth and brain development. Concurs Dr Daphne Yang, consultant, Department of Geriatric Medicine, Tan Tock Seng Hospital: A healthy and nutritious diet also goes a long way in optimising our brain and muscle health, reducing the risk of developing memory problems, muscle weakness and poorer mobility later in life. A childs nutritional needs are best supported when the family plays an active role – something FairPrice Group and FairPrice Foundations Start Strong, Stay Strong programme encourages. Says Ms Khoo: Children learn by observing their parents. When families are involved, parents can model positive eating behaviours, such as buying healthy food at the supermarket, cooking healthy meals, and choosing water over sugary drinks. Singapore is on the cusp of becoming a super-aged society, where 21 per cent or more of the population is aged 65 and above. A rapidly ageing population means rising incidence of chronic illness, frailty and malnutrition. Recognising these challenges, FairPrice Group and FairPrice Foundation have intensified their focus on nutrition gaps among the elderly over the past two years. Says Ms Jean Khong, general manager of FairPrice Foundation: Through our daily engagement with customers and beneficiaries over the last few years, weve learned that many in Singapore want to lead healthier lives through what they eat and how they keep fit. We want to help those in need achieve this ambition, by bridging the gaps in nutrition understanding and access for the communities we serve through the FairPrice Foundation. A data-driven approach underpins these efforts. In 2024, the foundation publishedA Full Plate: A Look at the Nutritional State of the Nation, which found that taste and cost often take precedence over nutrition – particularly among lower-income households. These findings led to the launch of A Full Plate,Singapores largest food donation drive, which channels shoppers donations towards more nutritious grocery bundles and hot meals for beneficiaries across the island. The initiative launched in 2024 with 10 charity partners and expanded in 2025 to include 21. Beyond access to food, national data points to specific nutritional gaps – particularly among seniors. According toHPBs National Nutrition Survey 2022, about half of adults aged 50 to 69 do not meet the recommended protein intake – crucial for maintaining muscle strength as people age. This finding echoed what FairPrice Foundation observed through its community engagement and the A Full Plate study: seniors need greater access to protein-rich foods. In response, FairPrice Group and FairPrice Foundation committed $1 million to the Protein Pledge. Running until 2030, this five-year initiative supports access to fresh protein, including staples such as eggs, for seniors, lower-income families, children from vulnerable backgrounds and migrant workers. One beneficiary is Ms Chio Yoon Lee, 68, who receives support through the North West Community Development Council. She is among an estimated 95,000 beneficiaries who are part of this initiative. Ms Lee had to retire from her job as a dishwasher after undergoing spine surgery and now counts on the Protein Pledge to help her manage daily nutritional needs. I appreciate that eggs are easy to prepare, and the Protein Pledge programme also provides some financial relief when it comes to buying groceries, she says. Another beneficiary, Madam Zainab Abdullah, 78, receives support through GoodLife! Makan. Living with diabetes for over a decade, the programmes distributions help her maintain balanced meals with eggs being a staple. She first learnt about the Protein Pledge through activities at her community kitchen, where she also picked up simple recipes and healthy eating tips. I feel very grateful that this programme exists, she says. I used to be unsure what foods were nutritious. Now I know eggs are a good source of protein. It shows that the organisers understand the challenges some seniors face. Efforts like providing eggs offer an immediate protein boost, but a recent study shows the gaps run deeper. In the recently concluded Stay Strong study conducted by Fairprice Group and FairPrice Foundation, seven in 10 seniors polled rarely seek new information on nutrition, and more than half do not actually know what goes into a healthy plate. These insights led to FairPrice Groups partnership with TTSH to build the Stay Strong programme that addresses these nutrition knowledge gaps for seniors, says Ms Khong. The initiative will be rolled out this year. Our goal is to combine TTSHs clinical expertise with our reach to engage seniors meaningfully on nutrition and empower them to eat better in their golden years, says Ms Khong. Seniors, in fact, require more protein as they age to prevent muscle loss, says Dr Yang. Muscle deterioration can lead to sarcopenia – age-related loss of muscle mass and strength – increasing the risk of falls, fractures and frailty, she explains. Beyond education, senior-friendly food development also plays a role, adds Ms Goh. Many protein-rich products today are not designed with seniors taste preferences or portion needs in mind, particularly in an Asian context, she says. Through this collaboration, we aim to develop nutritious options that better suit local seniors.

The competition and consumer regulator will continue to monitor both developments, said Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong in a written parliamentary response to an oral question on Jan 12. In December 2025, The Business Times reported that an entity linked to Zhao Zhichao of The Elegant Group is believed to have signed a dealto buy The Clementi Mallfor $809 million from Cuscaden Peak Investments. The Elegant Groups portfolio also includes nearby Grantral Mall@Clementi. Meanwhile, Temasek-linked property asset managers CapitaLand Investment and Mapletree Investments are mulling over a merger, which reportedly could create one of Asias largest real estate firms. There were concerns over how such consolidations would affect smaller tenants in heartland malls, and whether they will be at a disadvantage during lease renewals. Mr Gan said that Singapore adopts a voluntary merger notification scheme, where merger parties are not required to notify CCS of their merger transactions under the Competition Act, to balance between effective regulatory oversight and keeping compliance costs low. They are expected to self-assess whether transactions may lead to potential competition concerns, he added. But merger parties can approach CCS for pre-notification discussions or seek guidance on whether their merger may be anti-competitive. CCS has the power to step in, should information suggest that a merger may cause competition issues. Mr Gan noted that measures are also in place to support fair and balanced lease negotiations between property owners and tenants, and that Singapores retail scene remains competitive and vibrant.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/competition-watchdog-not-yet-notified-of-clementi-mall-sale-potential-capitaland-mapletree-merger
Govt expects media to uphold journalism standards: Josephine Teo,"Jan 12, 2026, 10:45 PM","Jan 12, 2026, 11:20 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f223fe91afab13a3cca96043e437adae175ec6b9af22515e38d341cf5be7d458,"Pasir Ris-Changi GRC MP Valerie Lee had expressed concern in a parliamentary question about online platform Stomp, which is run by SPH Media.ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO","['Singapore Parliament', 'SPH Media Trust', 'Journalism', 'Media', 'Hawker food']","SINGAPORE -The Government does not intervene in the editorial decisions of media outlets but expects them to uphold responsible journalism standards, said Minister for Digital Development and Information Josephine Teo. She said this in a written reply on Jan 12 to a parliamentary question by Ms Valerie Lee (Pasir Ris-Changi GRC) who expressed concern about online platform Stomp, which is run by SPH Media. Ms Lee asked if the Government was concerned about the potential impact Stomp might have on public trust, and the standards expected of state-supported platforms, given Stomps content often resembles tabloid-style coverage. Mrs Teo said the authorities expect all media outlets to uphold responsible journalism standards by ensuring their news reporting is accurate, fair and complies with the law. Stomp is also individually licensed under the Online News Licensing Scheme which requires licensees to comply with content standards to safeguard racial and religious harmony, public order, as well as good taste and decency, she added. When asked on Jan 12 what had prompted her question, Ms Lee told The Straits Times she found it worrying that a state-supported platform amplified one persons careless opinion and allowed a retiring heritage hawker to be reduced to tears. She was referencing a Stomp article published on Dec 23 that criticised the pricing and quality of food from a yong tau foo stall in Toa Payoh on the verge of closing. The commentary, parked under Stomps opinion section, under its hot takes banner, had triggered online discussion and sympathy for the stall owners. I share the ministers view that accuracy, fairness, good taste and decency are essential when it comes to responsible journalism, said Ms Lee. I hope this episode reminds all that tabloid-style reporting has real consequences, and that we must safeguard ordinary hawkers and citizens from further undue harm, she added. The stall mentioned in the article is Hup Chong Yong Tau Foo, which has been around for four decades and has operated at Block 203 Toa Payoh North for 10 years. It is slated to close in January. A Stomp spokesperson said that while opinion pieces are subjective by nature, it acknowledged the feedback received and will take it seriously. It will inform how we approach and review opinion-led content moving forward, said the spokesperson. We remain committed to a reporting stance that is rooted in encouraging thoughtful discussion around everyday issues, while upholding accuracy. In a Facebook post earlier on Dec 26, the family behind the stall had said they were deeply hurt by the article, adding that it turned what should have been a merry Christmas to the worst Christmas ever in our life. Hup Chong cited rising operating costs and other realities as its reasons for closing.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/govt-expects-media-to-uphold-journalism-standards-josephine-teo
"Over 70% of residential AMD fires between 2022 and 2025 involved uncertified, modified devices","Jan 12, 2026, 09:15 PM","Jan 13, 2026, 12:05 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/c24c282cddf0202da9dc3cc6ee7da45619a391fb730dc55117a36015e0d5216f,There was renewed concern in Parliament on Jan 12 over fires and incidents involving AMDs.PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO FILE,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Fires', 'Personal mobility devices', 'Ministry of Home Affairs']","SINGAPORE – Fires involving active mobility devices (AMDs) burn hotter and more rapidly, and their disproportionate impact is deeply concerning. Minister of State for Home Affairs Goh Pei Ming told Parliament on Jan 12 that while such devices accounted for less than 5 per cent of residential fires in the past five years, they caused more than 10 per cent of fire-related injuries and 25 per cent of fatalities. Also, between 2022 and 2025, more than 70 per cent of such fires involved illegally modified devices or those not tested and certified. There was renewed concern in Parliament on Jan 12 over fires and incidents involving AMDs. MPs filed seven questions regarding fires, while Workers Party Non-Constituency MP Andre Low moved an adjournment motion on fire safety in homes. Mr Low said some residents have shared with him their fears about their neighbours AMDs, which were being charged right by their front door. He said: (These AMDs are) a ticking time bomb that might one day trap them within their own homes. Not much can be done to assuage their fears today, because as it stands, such charging practices are by and large permitted. He also said more can be done to help those who live in older flats, which may be densely packed and have more enclosed corridors. Responding to some of the questions and to Mr Lows motion, Mr Goh said the increase in residential fires should be seen in the context of more flats having been built. So, while residential fires increased from 968 in 2024, to 1,051 cases in 2025, the situation had remained stable. In this light, the percentage of fires for the total dwelling stock has gone down in the last five years, from 0.067 per cent in 2021 to 0.065 per cent in 2025. The number of fatalities has also remained low, with fewer than six on average per year in the past five years. Singapores overall fire fatality rate is among the lowest internationally, he added. But AMDs remain an area of concern. Mr Goh said: The lithium-ion batteries pose fire risks and hazards, and that can result in AMD fires burning hotter and spreading more rapidly. The risks are even higher with devices that do not comply with relevant safety standards. On Jan 3, 20 people wereevacuated from a block in Bukit Purmei, near Telok Blangah,after a fire involving a power-assisted bicycle broke out in one of the flats there, while four people were taken to hospital on Jan 9 following afire in a Tampines flatthat was likely caused by a personal mobility aid. On Aug 13, 2025, two people died following afire in Jalan Bukit Merahbelieved to have started from a personal mobility device battery pack in the living room of a flat. Mr Goh said the Government takes a strict enforcement approach towards the import, sale and use of non-compliant AMDs. He also noted that in the last five years, the Land Transport Authority handled over 5,000 cases of non-compliant AMDs and took action against offenders including riders, owners and retailers. TheLand Transport and Related Matters Billwas read for the first time during the Jan 12 sitting, proposing enhancements to fire safety in relation to AMDs. These include mandatory registration of all new mobility scooters sold, and making it an offence to keep non-compliant e-scooters. Currently, it is an offence to use such devices that are not UL2272-certified, but not an offence to keep one, despite the severe fire safety risks. Mr Goh said the Ministry of Transport is looking to strengthen regulations on the online sale of AMDs, with plans to amend the law later in the year. Giving an overview of Singapores residential fire situation, he said the top three causes here in the past five years were unattended cooking, fires of electrical origin, and those arising from naked light. Unattended cooking accounted for a third of all residential fires. Mr Goh said: This means that the majority of fire incidents stem from human behaviour and practices, and are preventable. Questions from Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC), Mr Fadli Fawzi (Aljunied GRC) and Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang) touched on thefire in Hong Kongs Tai Po district. The tragedy in November 2025 saw a fire that blazed through the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex for over 40 hours, leaving 161 dead and 79 injured. Mr Goh said the Government is reviewing the incident and studying whether regulations for construction works and maintenance of residential buildings here need to be strengthened. The outcome of the review will be announced in due course, he said, noting that the use of bamboo as scaffolding is not allowed in Singapore. Community preparedness is the best defence against home fires, he added. Ultimately, fire safety is a collective responsibility. Only when everyone comes together and remains vigilant will we be able to further bring down the incidence of fires.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/over-70-of-residential-amd-fires-between-2022-and-2025-involved-uncertified-modified-devices
All healthcare service providers must contribute and share patients key health information,"Jan 12, 2026, 09:15 PM","Jan 13, 2026, 06:37 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b479f4c592feb9579f7ebeaa9a7068b65ac609572a36e332ef9c1eabecf4e266,"With the passing of the Health Information Bill, patients key health data will have to go into a national digital repository instead of only residing in paper records.PHOTO: ST FILE","['Singapore Parliament', 'Ministry of Health', 'Data protection', 'Tan Kiat How']","SINGAPORE – As more people receive care beyond hospitals and polyclinics, the Health Ministry is making it compulsory for all providers, including private specialist clinics, dental clinics and laboratories to contribute patients key health information to the countrys national repository. To help them come on board, the Government will offer various support measures. Recalcitrant providers could face fines or even jail time if they continue to fail to meet the requirements. Underthe Health Information Bill (HIB)passed in Parliament on Jan 12, healthcare providers will be given until early 2027 to meet the various data contribution and protection requirements. Introduced in 2011,the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) systemserves as a centralised repository for key health information crucial for continuity of care, such as diagnoses, medications, allergies, vaccinations, laboratory reports, radiological images and discharge summaries. With NEHR, patients do not need to repeat medical tests or take along paper medical reports and scans when visiting different healthcare providers. A central repository also minimises the risk of patients being prescribed medication they are allergic to. With the time saved, doctors can make better and faster decisions for their patients. The HIB will help us achieve the goal of One Patient, One Health Summary, One Care Journey, said Senior Minister of State for Health Tan Kiat How at the debate of the HIB in Parliament on Jan 12. We will work with and support healthcare providers and professionals in achieving this goal. Public hospitals, which handle 90 per cent of the countrys acute hospital workload, have been using NEHR since 2011. Primary care providers such as polyclinics and GP clinics on theHealthier SG initiativehave also progressively been on board since then. Under the HIB, healthcare providers, including public and private hospitals, private specialist clinics, outpatient dental clinics, dialysis centres, retail pharmacies, and clinical and radiological laboratories, will be required to contribute key patient data into NEHR. Mr Tan said the key features of HIB were adopted to suit the local context after the authorities studied frameworks governing the sharing of health information across healthcare providers in Australia, Estonia, Finland and Norway. As at Oct 31, 2025, about 70 per cent of the more than 2,000 GP clinics have joined the effort. Based on information on the Ministry of Healths (MOH) website, there are more than 2,000 GP clinics in Singapore. Out of the nine private hospitals here, five are on board NEHR, said the Ministry of Health. Four – Thomson Medical, Mount Alvernia Hospital, Farrer Park Hospital and Crawfurd Hospital – have yet to come onboard despiteearlier commitments to do so by end-2025. Mr Tan pointed out that only the key health information of Singaporeans, permanent residents and those with long-term immigration passes will be added into the system as they are more likely to seek care in Singapore over time. Health information of transient visitors, including medical tourists, will not be included. To allow for timely and effective care, healthcare professionals need not seek consent from the patient each time they access the patients NEHR records. Safeguarding patients health information, including those of a more sensitive nature such as records of mental conditions, was one of the key concerns raised by several MPs during the debate. Fourteen MPs spoke in support of the Bill. Mr Tan stressed that NEHR is not a new system and various safeguards have been built into it over the years, including role-based access, where authorised healthcare professionals can only access the types of health information required for their specific patient care role. Those who contribute to and access NEHR will also need to meet cybersecurity and data security requirements, and will be responsible for assessing and notifying the authorities on cybersecurity incidents and data breaches. He also emphasised that accessing NEHR for purposes relating to employment or insurance will be prohibited. This would mean healthcare professionals will not be allowed to access NEHR to fill out medical reports required for insurance claims or pre-employment medical screening forms. There are also technical safeguards in place, such as limiting the number of patient records that can be accessed within a stipulated timeframe. MOH said that regular audits are conducted, and more measures and processes will be added to limit and detect unauthorised access. Patients can monitor access of their NEHR information through their HealthHub account, and report any suspicious activities to MOH. Mr Tan said those who have privacy concerns may restrict access to their NEHR information, so that only select healthcare providers have access to it, which is similar to restrictions in Australia, Estonia and Hong Kong systems. This restriction feature is already available in NEHR. Since 2011, more than 2,300 patients have placed access restrictions on their NEHR records, which translates to less than 0.1 per cent of all patients with NEHR records. More than 180 of them have lifted the restrictions after being counselled on its benefits. Currently, access restrictions can be requested through public healthcare institutions. From the second half of 2026, patients can do so directly through their own HealthHub account, said Mr Tan. Nonetheless – even for these patients – healthcare providers will still be able to view their critical allergies and vaccination information as this is meant to ensure patient safety by preventing inappropriate prescriptions or immunisation. Doctors may be allowed to break glass and access the patients NEHR information during medical emergencies even if there are access restrictions. They would be asked to re-verify their credentials and declare the medical emergency. All such instances will also be subject to audits, with penalties in place for inappropriate break glass cases. Several MPs also raised concerns about small GP clinics not being able to meet the requirements, such as older doctors who may still be relying on pen-and-paper records, or intend to retire in a few years time and may not want to spend on digitalisation. MOH will be providing various support measures to help them. This includes a support package to defray NEHR onboarding costs and a white list of NEHR-compatible systems which meet the cybersecurity and data security requirements. The amount of funding to be made available to providers is still being discussed, said MOH. Mr Tan pointed out that with the use of NEHR-compatible systems, healthcare providers will only need to ensure their data security measures are in place, such as training relevant staff to access and use NEHR appropriately. He also spoke about offences under the HIB and corresponding penalties. For those which do not comply with data contribution, it will not be an offence in the first instance as they may face genuine challenges onboarding to NEHR. But for deliberate or reckless non-compliance or breaches, the authorities may issue directions to the provider to comply. Failing which, the provider could be liable to a fine of up to $20,000 and/or one years imprisonment upon conviction. Those who are convicted of unauthorised access of NEHR information will face a fine of up to $50,000 and/or two years imprisonment for their first offence. The maximum penalty is doubled for a repeat offence, or if the unauthorised access was for employment or insurance purposes. Providers which fail to put in place the cybersecurity or data security measures required under the HIB may face a fine of up to $1 million as the health information of many patients could be compromised. Nevertheless, these are maximum penalties, which are aimed at addressing the most egregious of breaches. We would like to reassure healthcare providers and healthcare professionals, as well as Singaporeans, that should potential breaches occur, MOH will look at the facts of each case carefully, said Mr Tan.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/all-healthcare-service-providers-must-contribute-and-share-patients-key-health-information

Mr Danny Ong, managing director of Setia Law, had also won alandmark freezing order in 2022 against unknown personsinvolved in a large cryptocurrency theft. His appointment was announced by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon on Jan 12 at theannual ceremony to mark the opening of the legal yearin Singapore. Mr Ong, 50, joins the elite ranks of a group of lawyers who are recognised for their outstanding advocacy skills, extensive grasp of the law and professional integrity. He is the 101st lawyer to receive the accolade since 1997, when the scheme started. The selection criteria wererefined in 2024to place greater emphasis on an applicants contributions to the development of Singapore law and the legal profession. The Singapore Academy of Law, which administers the senior counsel scheme, said Mr Ongs work in digital assets and cross-border enforcement has contributed to the shaping of legal principles in novel contexts. Speaking to reporters on Jan 12, Mr Ong said he hoped his appointment as senior counsel signifies to younger lawyers the importance of specialism, having an international perspective, and being brave in pushing boundaries in new areas of law. He recalled that there was no legal precedent when he handled the first cryptocurrency legal dispute, and he had to read books on digital assets, which he had never dealt with before. He is one of the few Singapore lawyers admitted to the International Insolvency Institute, a global non-profit organisation. A specialist textbook on commercial injunctions in Singapore that he co-authored is scheduled for publication in early 2026. Mr Ong grew up in Ipoh, Malaysia, before moving to Singapore to study on a Singapore government scholarship in secondary school. After studying law at NUS, he built his legal career in Singapore and Hong Kong, eventually becoming a partner at Rajah & Tann from 2008 to 2023. He set up Setia Law in 2023 with Mr Yam Wern-Jhien as a specialist disputes and crisis management practice. He is also currently co-executive director of the International Chamber of Commerces FraudNet, a global network of fraud and asset recovery specialists spanning more than 80 countries. When asked what advice he had for young lawyers, he stressed the importance of humility and being thick-skinned in learning from others. Mr Ong, who was educated primarily in Malay in his home town, said that when he was a young lawyer, his English proficiency was questioned by senior partners and his language corrected by judges. He and his wife, who is also a lawyer, have two daughters, aged 10 and 13. As the couple had decided not to employ a domestic helper, they juggle a lot, he said. Mr Ong said: Nowadays, the young ones say work-life balance, but actually, its just trying to manage and juggle. Were all extremely exhausted, of course... And in a way, Im thankful that we decided not to have help because it forces you. It forces me to run off at four oclock to go and pick up my kid... forces me to go back at 5.30 to cook. But it also means that between nine and 12, after they go to bed, you have to work.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/pioneer-in-crypto-disputes-appointed-senior-counsel

In view of these incidents, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in a Facebook post on Jan 12 urged companies to conduct a voluntary safety time-out as a pre-emptive move ahead of the seasonal rush around Chinese New Year. A safety time-out means taking a brief pause from work, especially when there are spikes in workplace incidents or emerging risks. MOM suggested a time-out from Jan 13 to Jan 27 that would apply to not just heavy vehicles, but also other vehicles at your worksite, including forklifts and mobile platforms, it said in its post. The other workplace deaths in December had involved various types of vehicles, said the WSH Council. On Dec 11, a worker was standing behind his delivery van on a service road which had a slight gradient. The van suddenly rolled backwards, striking and pinning the man underneath it. He was taken to hospital, where he died the following day. On Dec 15, a forklift operator was lowering a stack of plywood sheets when the stack toppled, striking and pinning a nearby worker. The worker was taken to hospital and later died. The stack of plywood sheets was found to be positioned off-centre on the forklift and was not secured to it. In the fourth case, which the WSH Council did not date, a lorry crashed into the rear of another, killing a worker. MOM said in its post that the safety time-out is an opportunity to review and strengthen safety procedures, reinforce control measures and address any potential safety gaps, and to reaffirm management commitment to protecting lives and preventing incidents. Employers are encouraged to tap the ministrys resources and grants such as the Lorry Crane Stability Control System Grant and the Productivity Solutions Grant to utilise vehicular safety technologies. The WSH Council in its advisory called on all companies to review their WSH management systems in order to ensure that vehicles and industrial mobile equipment are properly selected, operated and maintained to protect workers from harm. The council directed companies to ensure the following measures are included in their WSH management systems: Safe vehicle and equipment:Conduct pre-operation checks of the vehicle and equipment before use. Use the vehicle and equipment only if they are in good operating condition. Place vehicles and equipment on a regular inspection and preventive maintenance programme. Competent driver and operator:Deploy only drivers and operators who have completed the necessary training for the vehicle and equipment. Safe work procedures:Establish and implement such procedures for the specific task so that drivers and operators have detailed guidance on how to carry out the work safely. Safe work position:Train drivers and operators to ensure they and other workers or people in the vicinity are in safe positions before starting work. For operators of vans, forklifts and scissor lifts, the WSH Council recommended a review of risk assessments and putting in place control measures to prevent unintended vehicle movement such as the vehicle rolling forward or backward on slopes. With regard to lifting goods with forklifts, companies should review their forklift operations and ensure loads are properly prepared and secured before using the machine, said the council. All companies using mobile elevating work platforms such as scissor lifts should also review their risk assessments and implement control measures to prevent workers from colliding with overhead or other obstructions during operations, it added. More information can be found in the WSH Council advisory on its website.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/companies-urged-to-conduct-time-out-review-worker-safety-ahead-of-cny-rush

On Jan 12, Judy Teh Mui Eng, 60, pleaded guilty to multiple counts of forgery and dealing with the benefits of her criminal conduct. She has since made full restitution to MBH Hire Purchase. More than 100 other charges will be considered during her sentencing in March. While Teh was employed as a personal assistant at the company, her responsibilities included preparing payment vouchers and cheques payable to her boss brother, who was also a director there. In 2010, she hatched a plan to misappropriate the companys money, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Yee Jia Rong. Between June that year and March 2015, she prepared cheques with the payee name as either a credit card company or a bank. She then presented the cheques to her boss, falsely claiming that his brother had asked for advance payments. Her boss signed the cheques and the corresponding payment vouchers that were in his brothers name. Teh then added her own particulars to the back of the cheques, before depositing them into accounts, including those linked to her bank. In December 2014, she found out that her boss brother had cancelled accountslinked to his bank and acredit card company. She then hatched a new scheme to continue misappropriating MBHs funds. From December 2014 to April 2017, she used a pen with erasable ink to prepare cheques with the payee name indicated as Premium Automobile – a company linked to her boss and his brother. She then passed the cheques to her boss, who signed them. She also prepared corresponding payment vouchers in his brothers name, with the payment details indicated as advance to director.Her boss also signed the vouchers. The DPP said: Thereafter, the accused would erase the payee name and replace it with the names of companies that she was a director of, including Innova Alliance, Rejoice Entertainment, and The Chillout Place. The accused would also dispose of the payment voucher indicating that the payee was Premium (Automobile). Teh deposited the other cheques soon after, causingthe bankto process the payments from MBH to Innova, Rejoice and Chillout. Court documents stated that she used the money to settle her family expenses and finance her personal businesses. The DPP said that Tehs boss discovered her offences in May 2017 and MBH launched an internal investigation. He lodged a police report in February 2018, and Teh was charged in court three years later.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-admits-pocketing-over-1-8m-while-working-as-company-directors-personal-assistant

Replying to a parliamentary question on Jan 12, Coordinating Minister for Public Services Chan Chun Sing said the committee has just been formed, and will submit its report to the Government when ready. The committee is chaired by Mr Gan Seow Kee, who is chairman of the Singapore LNG Corporation and an alternate member of the Council of Presidential Advisers. Mr Chan, who is also Defence Minister, said the committee has been asked to recommend the appropriate salary levels based on the current salary framework, and to propose refinements where necessary so that the framework continues to be relevant. Political salaries – including that for the President, Prime Minister, Speaker, Deputy Speaker and political office-holders – have not been adjusted since 2012, when the Government accepted a review committees recommendations which put in place the current salary framework. Under the framework, ministerial salaries are benchmarked to the median income of the top 1,000 earners who are Singaporean citizens, with a 40 per cent discount to reflect the ethos of political service. Those among the top 1,000 earners include people in senior management positions such as chief executives, chief operating officers and chief financial officers; people working in the financial services such as bankers, traders and asset managers; and professionals such as lawyers, doctors and accountants. The reference monthly salary for an entry-level minister is $55,000, and the salary levels of other political appointment holders are determined based on their salary ratios to the entry-level minister pay, reflecting their roles and responsibilities. The framework covers the salaries of all political appointment holders, including Non-Constituency MPs and Nominated MPs, and took effect from May 2011. The 2012 White Paper on Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government recommended that an independent committee be appointed every five years to review the salaries, and the last time such a committee was appointed was in 2017. In 2018, a committee chaired by accountant Gerard Ee recommended that political salaries be adjusted annually in line with the movement of benchmark salaries, which it noted had gone up by 9 per cent since the salary framework had been put in place. However, the Government decided not to make any changes to political salaries, as it said then that the salary structure remained valid and there were economic uncertainties in the previous few years. In 2023, when it was time for another review,the Government deferred it, with Mr Chan – then Minister-in-charge of the Public Service – saying that it was dealing with other pressing issues. These included a more uncertain geopolitical situation with conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine; heightened political contestation; and significant uncertainties in the global economy that impacted Singapores economy, wages and inflation outlook. The Government will review the political salaries framework and benchmark in due course to ensure that they remain relevant and up to date, Mr Chan said then. Apart from Mr Gan, the other members on the latest committee are: Mr Ramlee Buang, member of the Public Service Commission Ms Cham Hui Fong, deputy secretary-general and group director, workforce at NTUC Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng, executive chairman of Teckwah Industrial Corporation Ms Theresa Goh, chairman of Charity Council Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, chairman of the NUS Board of Trustees and chairman of GXS Bank Ms Lily Kong, president of Singapore Management University and member of the Public Service Commission Mr Shekaran K. Krishnan, partner at Ernst & Young On Jan 12, Mr Chan said in reply to a question filed by Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) that on receiving the committees report, the Government will consider the findings and provide an update to Parliament. In 2012, Parliament held a thorough debate on the White Paper over 2½ days, with speeches by 29 MPs from both sides of the aisle. The White Paper was endorsed by the House.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/committee-formed-to-review-salaries-for-political-appointment-holders-chan-chun-sing

The talks come as Pakistans defence industry moves forward with a series of defence procurement negotiations, including deals with Libyas National Army and Sudans army, and looks to establish itself as a sizable regional player. One source said the talks revolved around the sale of JF-17 jets, a multi-role combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and killer drones designed for surveillance and striking targets. The other two sources said the talks were in an advanced stage and involved more than 40 JF-17 jets. One of them said Indonesia was also interested in Pakistans Shahpar drones. The sources did not share any discussions about delivery timelines and the number of years a proposed deal would span. Both Indonesias Defence Ministry and Pakistans confirmed the meeting between Indonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and Pakistans Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu. The meeting focused on discussing general defence cooperation relations, including strategic dialogue, strengthening communication between defence institutions, and opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields in the long term, defence ministry spokesperson Brigadier-General Rico Ricardo Sirait told Reuters, adding the talks had not yet led to concrete decisions. The Pakistani military confirmed the meeting in a statement and also said the defence minister met army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for talks that focused on matters of mutual interest, evolving regional and global security dynamics, and exploration of avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation. One additional security source with knowledge of military procurement talks said Pakistan was discussing the sale of JF-17 Thunder jets, air defence systems, training for junior, mid-level, and senior Indonesian air force officials, and engineering staff. The Indonesia deal is in the pipeline, retired air marshal Asim Suleiman, who remains briefed on air force deals, told Reuters, adding that the number of JF-17 jets involved was close to 40. Indonesias President Prabowo Subianto was in Pakistan in December for a two-day visit for talks on improving bilateral ties, including defence. Indonesia has put in a slew of orders for jets in the past few years, including 42 French Rafale jets worth US$8.1 billion (S$10.4 billion) in 2022 and 48 KAAN fighter jets from Turkey in 2025 to strengthen its air force and replace its ageing air force fleet. Jakarta has also considered buying Chinas J-10 fighter jets and is in talks to purchase US-made F-15EX jets. Interest in the Pakistani militarys weapons development programme has surged sinceits jets were deployed in a short conflictwith India in 2025. The JF-17s have been at the centre of that growing attention, figuring in a deal with Azerbaijan and the US$4 billion weapons pact with the Libyan National Army. Pakistan is also eyeing a defence pact with Bangladesh that could include the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve with Dhaka. Reuters has also reported that Islamabad was in talks with Riyadh for a defence deal that could be worth between US$2 billion and US$4 billion and involves the conversion of Saudi loans into military supplies.

Images of the attack showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle overturned on the roadside. In a statement, the Islamist militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack. Tank deputy police chief Pervez Shah said five police personnel were killed on the spot after the remote-controlled bomb went off, while two others had died in hospital.

He said this was important as entry points across the country transition away from the old Malaysian Immigration System to the new National Integrated Immigration System. During this upgrade, glitches may occur due to data migration and infrastructure issues, he said. What matters is how quickly we troubleshoot and respond when systems fail.

Lieutenant-General Norathip Poinok, who is also the director of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) Region 4, said the military, police and administrative authorities are integrating forces to pursue those responsible. He added that investigators found bloodstains at a petrol station in Cho-airong district, Narathiwat, and forensic teams are analysing the evidence. He said authorities are not ruling out any motives, including security-related factors and local political dynamics, noting that the incidents occurred during the period of subdistrict administrative organisation (SAO) elections. However, he assessed that the petrol station attacks were connected to the same network as the Su-ngai Kolok gold robbery, though carried out by a different sub-group. The earlier case involved a robbery at a Yaowarat gold shop branch inside a Big C store in Su-ngai Kolok on Oct 5, 2025. The attackers were armed, stole gold worth more than 35 million baht (S$1.4 million), shot and injured a soldier, and set an explosive device to delay pursuit. Security agencies said DNA evidence in that case was linked to an insurgent group, and the suspects were believed to have fled through natural crossings along the border. Following the robbery, authorities tightened border controls along the Golok River, a stretch of more than 100km, closing key informal routes and coordinating with Malaysias Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) to block escape lines. Lt Gen Norathip said DNA tests have now identified one suspect from a group estimated at around 10 people. The suspect is from Su-ngai Padi district and is linked to multiple security cases, he said. He added that forensic checks on a pickup truck used in the petrol station attacks found DNA matching an insurgent group, and he insisted the perpetrators were not state officials, rejecting online disinformation claims.

Nepal estimated it suffered losses of about US$586 million (S$753.55 million) and that nearly 15,000 people lost their jobs after proteststoppled the government in September 2025. The youth-led demonstrations, initially triggered by anger over a brief government ban on social media, were fuelled by deeper frustration over corruption and economic hardship. After a police crackdown killed young protesters, the riots spread and Parliament was set ablaze, prompting the governments collapse. At least 77 people were killed. More than 27,000 people applied for the temporary police jobs on Jan 9 and Jan 10, the first two days of applications, Nepal police spokesman Abinarayan Kafle said. Ms Sarika Karki, 20, said she was crossing her fingers to earn some pocket money. I am also Gen Z, but I do not have a job, she told AFP in the capital Kathmandu on Jan 11. I hope the election will go well, and I am able to help in my own way as a temporary police officer. Nepal plans to fill 149,090 police posts ahead of the March polls, with each recruit paid roughly US$280 for 40 days of service – a princely sum where per capita gross national income in 2025 was US$1,404, according to a UN monitoring report. More than 839,000 Nepalis left the country of 30 million to work abroad in 2025, according to government data. And 82 per cent of the countrys workforce is in informal employment, the World Bank says. The temporary officers will be tasked with managing queues at polling stations, carrying ballot boxes and other logistical duties. Sunday was a public holiday but so many people, most (of them) youths, were queueing outside police stations with great excitement, police spokesman Kafle told AFP. There were queues across all 77 districts to fill the application form on Jan 12, he said. Many of the young applicants would be participating in their first election as a temporary police officers.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, estimated K-Food+ exports in 2025 rose 5.1 per cent on-year to an all-time high of US$13.62 billion, of which food products accounted for US$10.41 billion and agricultural industries US$3.22 billion. Food exports rose 4.3 per cent from 2024 to break past the US$10 billion mark, extending their expansion for the 10th straight year. Ramyeon led the charge, becoming the first single food item toexceed US$1.5 billion in annual exports. Rising global demand, expanded production and a more stable supply chain drove the growth, the ministry noted, as sales surged not only in China and the US but also in Central Asia and the Middle East. China was the largest market at US$385 million, followed by the US at US$255 million. Ramyeon has settled into its role as one of South Koreas steadiest exports, and its makers are quietly broadening their production base. Nongshim, with facilities at home and abroad, is building an export-only factory in Busan, while Samyang is constructing its first overseas plant in China. Otoki, known for its Jin Ramen product, established its US unit in 2025 and is moving ahead with plans to build a plant in California by 2027. Besides instant noodles, eleven other products, including sauces, ice cream and fresh produce, also reached all-time highs. Sauces, riding on the popularity of Korean spicy flavours, reached US$412 million, up 4.6 per cent on-year. Ice cream crossed the US$100-million line for the first time, thanks to vegan, low-fat and zero-sugar variations. Amid export growth across major markets, the US remained the largest, with shipments rising 13.2 per cent to a record US$1.8 billion, followed by China at US$1.59 billion. Europe posted a 13.6 per cent increase to US$774 million, while exports to Gulf countries jumped 22.6 per cent to US$412 million. According to the ministry, ramyeon, sauces and ice cream drove much of the growth across these markets, while Europe in particular saw rising demand for health supplements, kimchi and rice-based foods. Meanwhile, agricultural industries also posted their strongest performance in 2025, as exports climbed 8 per cent to US$3.22 billion on solid demand for farm machinery, pesticides, fertilisers, seeds and veterinary medicines. Leading the category was farm machinery, which rose 10.8 per cent to US$1.35 billion on a broader product line-up in the US and expansion into Asian and European markets. Even in a challenging trade environment, we delivered a record result on the back of strong global interest in K-food and the competitiveness of K-Food+ products, said Agriculture Minister Song Mi-ryung. The government has set a US$16 billion export target for K-Food+ in 2026 and will back companies so competitive products can expand globally. In December, the South Korean government launched a K-food export strategy focused on developing distinctive products, easing business hurdles and expanding into promising markets such as the Middle East. It plans to launch market entry projects involving multiple companies and step up support for overseas certification and compliance.

At least two people – including a 12-year-old girl who suffered a gunshot – have been injured since Jan 11 in Coxs Bazar, home to more than a million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. We are on high alert and have already detained 53 people for trespassing, Colonel Moinuddin Ahmed of paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) told AFP. Local witnesses said ARSA fighters were detained on Jan 11 after crossing into Bangladeshi territory. One of them (detained persons) has been sent to hospital while the rest are in police custody (and) legal procedures are ongoing, Teknaf police station official Saiful IslamtoldAFP. ARSA was formed to wage an insurgency against the stateless Muslim minoritys persecution in Myanmar and is also fighting rival Arakan Army guerrillas. Bangladesh military officials say heavy fighting is ongoing across the border in Myanmars Rakhine state. Around a dozen border villages in Myanmar have been affected because of heavy gunfire, mortar shelling and bombardment, according to Bangladesh villagers and paramilitary officials, with plumes of smoke visible from the Bangladesh side. There is fear in Bangladesh border villages, with most people not stepping out of their homes and many donning helmets when they do. A senior paramilitary official told AFP: There is now a three-way conflict: ARSA is fighting the Arakan Army on the ground, while the military junta is conducting air strikes. Dhaka says it has deployed its law enforcement agencies in villages close to the border to keep tabs on the situation and possible illegal crossings.

This year, we will overhaul the ministrys anti-corruption plan on a large scale, Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said in his New Years address to staff on Jan 12. We will review and improve all tender and procurement processes in line with best practices. My call is for all of us to join together to clean up all forms of leakage and corruption, no matter who does it, he said in the speech that was livestreamed on the Defence Ministrys Facebook page. Malaysias armed forces have been grappling with a wave of negative publicity in recent weeks, putting pressure on leaders to respond swiftly. On Jan 8, a former army chief wasremanded for seven daysto assist in the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commissions probe into suspected irregularities in army procurement. The ministry has also ordered an internal investigation into claims of immoral activities in army camps that have gone viral on social media. The Royal Malaysian Air Force said on Jan 10 that 20 of its officers were found to have been involved, based on early investigations. Datuk Seri Khaled said anyone found guilty of such activity would be punished and dismissed. No one should have to tolerate any human rights abuse. No woman should be treated as a sex object or entertainment, in the armys mess halls or residences, he said. Its crucial that we restore the trust of the people and the country in the armed forces, Mr Khaled said.

He posted on social media on Jan 12 that the new duty would be effective immediately, without providing further detail. The administration has yet to issue paperwork outlining the scope of the charges. Any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America. This Order is final and conclusive, he said. He offered little clarity about how he defined doing business with Iran. The Islamic Republics major trading partners include India, Turkey and China. The US president already imposed levies as high as 50 per cent on Indian goods tied to their purchase of Russian oil. An additional 25 per cent tariff hitting products from Beijing risks upsetting the trade truce Mr Trump negotiated with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year. Iran has experienced weeks of mass unrest, which was initially sparked by a currency crisis and worsening economic conditions but has increasingly been aimed at the regime. It has amounted to the biggest challenge to the Islamic Republics ruling system since 1979. While Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneis regime has weathered protests before, the demonstrations are spreading and drew hundreds of thousands of people, by some accounts, across the country over the weekend. Iranian authorities have sought to stamp out the protests with more than 500 people killed so far and more than 10,000 arrests, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency. Mr Trump has openly backed the protesters and warned Tehran against violently repressing the demonstrations. In an interview on Fox News last week, he said the US would hit Iran very hard if it continued to shoot at protesters. On Jan 11, the US President told reporters that the Iranian leadership has reached out to seek talks and that a meeting is being set up, without offering details on timing. Still, he said that his administration is considering potential options and indicated he was coordinating with allies in response to Iran. Were looking at it very seriously. The military is looking at it, and were looking at some very strong options, Mr Trump told reporters. Im getting an hourly report and were going to make a determination. He has been briefed on a range of options for military strikes in Iran, including nonmilitary sites, a White House official said over the weekend. The US President is seriously considering authorising an attack, according to the official who requested anonymity to detail internal discussions. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has opened channels of communication with Trumps Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, a spokesman from the ministry said on Jan 12. Iran has warned the US and Israel – which coordinated to carry out strikes on nuclear facilities in the country last year – against any attempt to intervene. Tehran and Washington have not had formal diplomatic ties for decades. Mr Trumps threats to Iran have the region on edge, coming on the heels of a US strike earlier this month in Venezuela – another oil-rich country – which led to the capture of strongman Nicolas Maduro. Should the US or its ally, Israel, intervene, that threatens to draw neighboring countries into the crisis and risk access to the Strait of Hormuz, a key waterway for energy exporters.

The governments call for rallies in support of the Islamic republic drew thousands on Jan 12, a turnout supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protests – which the authorities attribute to foreign interference – had been defeated. Rights groups have warned an internet blackout that monitor Netblocks says has lasted four days was aimed at masking a deadly crackdown on the protests. The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said it had confirmed 648 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, and thousands more injuries, but warned the death toll was likely much higher – according to some estimates more than 6,000. IHR added that the internet shutdown made it extremely difficult to independently verify these reports, saying an estimated 10,000 people had been arrested. The international community has a duty to protect civilian protesters against mass killing by the Islamic republic, said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene militarily if Tehran killed protesters, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying on Jan 12 that military options including air strikes were still on the table, but diplomacy is always the first option for the president. More than two weeks of demonstrations initially sparked by economic grievances have turned into one of the biggest challenges yet to the theocratic system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution ousted the shah. Mr Khamenei, in power since 1989 and now 86, said in a statement that the Jan 12pro-government rallies were a warning to the United States. These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries, he said, according to state TV. In the capital Tehran, state TV showed people brandishing the national flag and prayers read for victims of what the government has termed riots. At Enghelab (Revolution) Square, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told the crowd that Iran was fighting a four-front war, listing economic war, psychological war, military war with the United States and Israel, and today a war against terrorists – a reference to the protests. Flanked by the slogans Death to Israel, Death to America in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teach Mr Trump an unforgettable lesson if Iran were attacked. But Mr Trump said on Jan 11 that Irans leadership had called him seeking to negotiate, and Leavitt noted public messages from Iranian authorities were quite different from the messages the administration is receiving privately. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran that Iran was not seeking war but is fully prepared for war, while calling for fair negotiations. Foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said a channel of communication was open between Araghchi and Trumps special envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff despite the lack of diplomatic relations. Exiled former crown prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi, who has been vocal in calling for protests, told CBS news the government was trying to trick the world into thinking that (it) is ready to negotiate once again. He said Trump was a man that means what he says and says what he means and who knows whats at stake. The red line that was drawn has been definitely surpassed by this regime. Mr Pahlavi now lives in the US and is a prominent opposition figure among the Iranian diaspora. State outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning in Tehran, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that the number of protests is decreasing. Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. The government has declared three days of national mourning for those killed. The European Union has voiced support for the protesters and on Jan 12 said it was looking into imposing additional sanctions on Iran over the repression of demonstrations. The European Parliament also announced it had banned all Iranian diplomats and representatives from the assemblys premises. The Iranian foreign ministry said it had summoned diplomats in Tehran representing France, Germany, Italy and the UK, demanding they withdraw official statements supporting the protesters. French President Emmanuel Macron, however, issued a statement later on Jan 12 condemning the state violence that indiscriminately targets Iranian women and men who courageously demand respect for their rights. Non-essential French embassy staff left Iran on Jan 11 and 12, two sources with knowledge of the matter told AFP. Tehran ally Russia, for its part, slammed what it called attempts by foreign powers to interfere in Iran, state media reported, in Moscows first reaction to the protests.

The incidents involved two migrants from Honduras, one from Cuba and another from Cambodia, and occurred from Jan 3 to 9, according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The spate of in-custody deaths coincided with thefatal shooting of a Minnesota motherof three by an ICE officer, an incident that sparked protests in Minneapolis and cities around the country. The Trump administration aims to ramp up deportations and has increased the number of migrants in detention. As at Jan 7, ICE statistics showed that the agency was detaining 69,000 people. The numbers were expected to rise following a massive ICE funding infusion passed by the US Congress in 2025. At least 30 people died in ICE custody in 2025, the highest level in two decades, agency figures showed. Ms Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, called the high number of deaths truly staggering and urged the administration to shutter detention centres. The US Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Cuban detainee Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died on Jan 3 in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration on the grounds of Fort Bliss in Texas. ICE said it was investigating the death of Lunas, adding that he had become disruptive, was placed in isolation, and later found in distress. He was pronounced dead by emergency medical technicians, ICE said. The two Honduran men Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, and Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, 68, died in area hospitals in Houston and Indio, California, on Jan 5 and 6, respectively, both following heart-related issues, ICE said. Parady La, a Cambodian man, 46, died on January 9 following severe drug withdrawal symptoms at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, ICE said. The administration began using that space in 2025 it said. The Trump administration has greatly reduced the number of migrants released from detention on humanitarian grounds, driving some to accept deportation.

Officials said hundreds of apartment blocks in the capital remained without heat despite round-the-clock efforts by the crews. Humanitarian centres, dubbed resilience points, were open for people to keep warm and charge electronic devices. Russia has systematically attacked Ukraines energy system since it invaded its neighbour in 2022 and the air strikes have intensified in recent months. Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said a programme was being launched to raise wages and provide support for participants in emergency work brigades. He issued a new warning to heed air raid alerts as night-time temperatures sank to minus 15 Celsius (5 F) or lower. There is intelligence information. The Russians are preparing a new massive strike, he said. Drones to exhaust air defence systems and missiles. They want to take advantage of the cold. The strike may occur in the coming days. Please take care of yourselves. Protect Ukraine. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba, writing on Telegram, said 90% of Kyivs apartment buildings have had heating restored, leaving fewer than 500 dwellings still to be connected. Mayor Vitali Klitschko put the number with no heating at 800, most on the west bank of the Dnipro River. He said a meeting of the Kyiv city council would be convened on Thursday to debate the most pressing issues facing residents. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, presenting the programme for bonus payments, said the work conducted by emergency crews stood at the very limit of human endurance, often involving life-threatening risks across the entire country. This applies to specialists who, in freezing conditions, go directly to the sites of strikes and restore supplies of heat, electricity, water and gas. Residents made their way to one of the humanitarian centres on the east bank of the river in the evening - two tents pitched on a small area of open ground. They charged their devices and chatted, while outside, the din of whining generators filled the air. Its dark in the apartment. I have an electric stove, so its impossible to heat up lunch or dinner, or make tea, said Kateryna Zubko, 67, an engineer who has lived without power, heating and water since the latest attack.

The dismissal of the prosecutor, Robert K. McBride, is the latest fallout in the Justice Department overPresident Donald Trumps effort to punish Mr Comey, the former FBI director and his longtime nemesis, whom the president blames for past investigations of his conduct. Mr McBride had been in the US attorneys office for the Eastern District of Virginia for only a couple of months, temporarily serving as the top deputy to Ms Lindsey Halligan after more than a decade as a federal prosecutor in Kentucky. Mr Trump selected Ms Halligan as the US attorney after her predecessor resisted bringing charges against Mr Comey, saying the evidence was not sufficient to warrant doing so. Ms Halligan was put in the job through an unusual personnel maneuver that a judge later determined was unlawful. In doing so, the judge declared that she was not a valid US attorney and dismissed two high-profile cases that she had brought, charging Mr Comey with lying to Congress and charging Attorney-General Letitia James of New York with lying on mortgage paperwork. The administration has tried to restart the Comey prosecution and wanted Mr McBride to lead that effort, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Mr McBride said he could not do that while also running the prosecutors office as the first assistant US attorney – he could do one or the other, these people said. One person familiar with the events disputed that explanation, stating that Mr McBride had been dismissed because he had secretly met with judges in the district to try to persuade them to appoint him as US attorney. Mr McBride, that person added, had resisted pursuing immigration-related investigations related to local jurisdictions sanctuary policies and drug enforcement. The person also said Justice Department leaders supported the decision to fire Mr McBride. It is common for the leaders of a US attorneys office, including the top deputy, known as a first assistant, to meet with judges in the district, particularly given that the court had declared Ms Halligan unlawfully appointed. In December, the Trump administration appealed the ruling, issued by Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, voiding Ms Halligans appointment as US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Despite Ms Curries order, Ms Halligan has continued to lay claim to that title, signing court papers as the districts top prosecutor. A federal judge in Richmond, Virginia, has given Ms Halligan until Jan 13 to explain in writing why doing so is not a false or misleading statement. Continuing to do so, the judge suggested, could lead to disciplinary measures. Senior Justice Department officials have privately decided that because Ms Curries ruling did not expressly remove Ms Halligan from office, she could remain, according to people familiar with their decision. Ms Curries decision to disqualify Ms Halligan centred on Mr Trumps unorthodox move to appoint her in an interim capacity, replacing his previous pick, who was also serving in a temporary role. Ms Currie found that federal law did not allow the administration to appoint two interim prosecutors in succession. Mr Trump fired Ms Halligans predecessor, Erik S. Siebert, after he refused to bring charges against Mr Comey and Ms James. Other judges have rejected the administrations efforts to install US attorneys in a similar fashion. Federal judges in other states have made similar rulings against Ms Alina Habba as the US attorney in New Jersey and Mr John Sarcone in upstate New York.

Ms Machado has been sidelined by Washington since US forcesseized long-term authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro on Jan 3and the Trump administration announced it would be running Venezuela. Disregarding Ms Machado and her understudy Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, Mr Trump has been working instead with acting president Delcy Rodriguez, left in power with other Maduro cronies. Mr Trump haswarned Ms Rodriguez to toe Washingtons lineor face the consequences – particularly on granting access to the South American countrys vast oil reserves. A US administration official told AFP the Republican president will meet Ms Machado at the White House on Jan 15. Venezuela, meanwhile, announced it had freed 116 more people jailed under Maduro – many for taking part in protests after his disputed 2024 election. Rights groups questioned the numbers, and family members clamored for speedier releases promised by Caracas under pressure from Washington. Relatives have been camped out at prisons for days, growing increasingly restless as loved ones have failed to appear. We simply ask that they keep their word, said Mr Manuel Mendoza, who had driven six hours to be at the El Rodeo prison, about 30km from Caracas, for his sons Jose Daniels anticipated release. Its already been four nights waiting out in the open air, suffering. UN experts and the opposition said only about 50 prisoners have been freed so far out of the 800-1,200 that rights groups estimate are being held. Ms Machado on Jan 12 urged Pope Leo XIV to intercede on behalf of prisoners. I asked him to intercede for all Venezuelans who remain kidnapped and disappeared, Ms Machado said after an audience with the pontiff at the Vatican. Mr Gonzalez Urrutia – who ran as the oppositions presidential candidate in 2024 after Ms Machado was disqualified by institutions loyal to Maduro – said every hour that passes is a new form of violence against families of prisoners. Ms Rodriguez, despite being a staunch Maduro ally, is negotiating on several fronts with Washington, which is looking to take advantage of Venezuelas vast oil reserves. US envoys visited Caracas last week to discuss reopening Washingtons embassy there seven years after diplomatic ties were severed. On Jan 11, Mr Trump said he was open to a meeting with Ms Rodriguez and that his administration was working really well with hers. He said he hoped the freed prisoners will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done. But experts mandated to a UN fact-finding mission said in a statement on Jan 12 that the dozens of people freed so far was far short of Venezuelas international human rights obligations. Frustration was growing among about 40 relatives still camped out outside El Rodeo prison. Rights NGO Foro Penal said 15 people had been released from the facility, but family members told AFP they were whisked away through a back exit without seeing the loved ones waiting for them. The government in Caracas said a review of prisoner files was ongoing. Ms Machado said she had underscored Urrutias legitimacy in her talks with Pope Leo and sought the popes backing for the prompt advancement of the transition to democracy in Venezuela. The opposition and much of the international community consider Mr Urrutia the legitimate victor of Venezuelas last presidential election. Ms Machadowas awarded the Nobel Peace Prizein 2025 and dedicated it to Mr Trump, who has made no secret of his frustration at being passed over for the award. In Caracas on Jan 12, Ms Rodriguez made a number of ministerial changes, naming a former Maduro bodyguard as minister of the presidential office – charged with managing her agenda and liaising with state agencies. She also replaced the head of the presidential guard, who leads the feared counterintelligence unit.

Trump weighs response to Iran crackdown; Tehran says communication open with US,"Jan 13, 2026, 05:07 AM","Jan 13, 2026, 05:07 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ee1223c49bbe8d1df20df14e945109931843155503e2d545275067311ef7e252,"Cars burn in a street during a protest in Tehran, Iran, on Jan 8, 2026.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Iran', 'Donald Trump', 'Protests', 'Economic slowdown', 'Inflation/Price level']","DUBAI - Tehran said on Jan 12 it is keeping communications open with the US as President Donald Trump weighed responses to adeadly crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran, which pose one of the stiffest challenges to clerical rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Mr Trump said on Jan 11 the US may meet Iranian officials and he was in contact with Irans opposition, while piling pressure on its leaders, including threatening possible military action over lethal violence against protesters. While airstrikes were one of many alternatives open to Mr Trump, diplomacy is always the first option for the president, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Jan 12. What youre hearing publicly from the Iranian regime is quite different from the messages the administration is receiving privately, and I think the president has an interest in exploring those messages, she said. US-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 572 people - 503 protesters and 69 security personnel. Since the protests began on Dec 28 and spread around the country, 10,694 people have been arrested, the group said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the tallies. The flow of information from the Islamic Republic has been hampered by an internet blackout since Jan 8. Irans leaders, their regional clout much reduced, are facing fierce demonstrations that evolved from complaints about dire economic hardships to defiant calls for the fall of the deeply entrenched clerical establishment. Despite the massive scale of the protests, there are no signs of splits in the Shiite clerical leadership, military or security forces, and demonstrators have no clear central leadership. The opposition is fragmented. In verified video footage, Iranians gathered at the Kahrizak Forensic Centre in Tehran on Jan 11, standing over rows of dark body bags. Iran has not given an official death toll, but blames the bloodshed on US interference and what it calls Israeli- and US-backed terrorists. State-run media has focused attention on the deaths of security forces. Irans Ministry of Intelligence said on Jan 12 it had detained terrorist teams responsible for acts including killing paramilitary volunteers loyal to the clerical establishment, torching mosques and attacking military sites, according to a statement carried by state media. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Tehran was studying ideas proposed by Washington, though these were incompatible with US threats. Communications between (US special envoy Steve) Witkoff and me continued before and after the protests and are still ongoing, he told Al Jazeera. The ambassadors of Britain, Italy, Germany and France in Tehran were summoned to the foreign ministry, semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Jan 12, and asked to relay Tehrans request to withdraw their support for the protests to their governments. A French diplomatic source said the ambassadors had strongly expressed their concerns. Addressing a large crowd in Tehrans Enqelab Square on Jan 12, Parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said Iranians were fighting a war on four fronts - economic war, psychological warfare, military war against the US and Israel, and today a war against terrorism. Mr Araqchi said on Jan 12 that a total of 53 mosques and 180 ambulances had been set on fire since the protests erupted. Mr Trump said on Jan 11 that Iran had called to negotiate about its disputed nuclear programme. Israel and the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war in June. A meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what is happening before the meeting, he told reporters on Air Force One. Mr Trumpwas to meet with senior adviserson Jan 13 to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal reported that the options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources. Striking military installations could be highly risky, as some may be located in heavily populated areas. Mr Qalibaf warned Washington against a miscalculation. Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target, he said. However, Tehran is stillrecovering from 2025s war,and its regional clout has been weakened by blows to allies such as Lebanons Hezbollah since the Oct 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel also killed top Iranian military commanders in the June war. The protests began in response to soaring prices that have worsened daily hardships, before turning against the clerical rulers who have governed for more than 45 years. Iranians havegrown increasingly resentful of the powerful Revolutionary Guards, whose business interests including oil and gas, construction and telecommunications are worth billions of dollars. Mr Araqchi said on Jan 12 the situation was under total control, after violence linked to protests spiked over the weekend. He said internet service would be resumed in coordination with security authorities.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, described the nationwide protests gripping Iran as an uprising. He said the unrest showed that Russia had to rethink its close links with Iran, which have included its wide use of Iranian-made Shahed drones in the nearly four-year-old war against Kyiv. Every normal person on Earth very much wants the people of Iran to finally be fortunate enough to free themselves from the regime that exists there and that has brought so much evil, including to Ukraine and to other countries, Zelenskiy said. It is important that the world not miss this moment, when change is possible. Every leader, every country, international organisations must engage now and help people remove those who are responsible for Iran unfortunately being what it has been. U.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 572 people and the arrests of more than 10,000 in protests which began on December 28. The protests have evolved from complaints about economic hardships to calls for the fall of the clerical establishment. Russia and Iran have developed closer ties since the Kremlin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a 20-year strategic partnership pact last year that deepened military ties and boosted cooperation in a range of areas.

Forum: Collective responsibility key to protecting elderly road users,"Jan 13, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Police', 'Road safety', 'Senior citizens']","We thank Mr Melvin Goh Kwang Hua for his letter More measures needed to protect seniors on the roads (Jan 1). We share Mr Gohs concerns about the increase in elderly pedestrian fatalities. The Traffic Police has been addressing this issue through a sustained, multi-pronged approach of enforcement, education and engagement. This includes regular enforcement operations at jaywalking hot spots and educational talks at road safety sessions and community events. We also work with grassroots organisations and the Singapore Road Safety Council to remind seniors of the importance of using designated crossing points and remaining vigilant. We share Mr Gohs desire to lower vehicle speeds within neighbourhoods. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is expanding its Friendly Streets initiative to all towns by 2030. This includes introducing traffic-calming measures such as road humps, raised zebra crossings, street signage and road markings to remind drivers to slow down in designated neighbourhood zones. These infrastructural improvements complement our enforcement efforts. Enhanced penalties have been in place since July 1, 2021, for traffic offences committed in Silver Zones, including speeding, beating red lights and failing to give way to pedestrians. From Jan 1, 2026, enhanced penalties of an additional two demerit points and an additional $100 in composition sums apply to offenders who commit traffic offences in Friendly Streets. This will enhance deterrence and strengthen protection for seniors. Road safety is a collective responsibility. We urge motorists to exercise patience and vigilance around vulnerable road users, and encourage pedestrians to avoid jaywalking for their own safety.

We appreciate the thoughtful perspectives shared. The Singapore Biennale encourages wide public engagement with contemporary art by local and international artists. Over the years, we have been expanding the reach of the Biennale and bringing the artworks closer to communities.For 2026, we have sought to locate artworks across various sites, to enable Singaporeans to engage with art beyond traditional museum settings, and to encounter art in the course of their daily lives. We acknowledge that a citywide format can present navigational and experiential challenges for visitors, and that clear contextual framing is important to help audiences engage meaningfully with the works. We have been continuously improving the wayfinding and signage since the beginning of the Biennale. This includes strengthening online and on-site visitor information, digital navigation, and physical wayfinding across sites, such as clearer on-site cues and more detailed print and digital artwork maps. In addition, Singapore Art Museum currently offers public tours of the Biennale, which facilitate deeper learning experiences. Taking into account ongoing feedback, we will continue to refine wayfinding and interpretive material to improve clarity and accessibility for the public. Contemporary art can offer new ways and perspectives for us to understand and experience the world we live in. The Singapore Biennale continues to be a key platform for local contemporary artists to showcase, experiment and engage through works that speak to local and global audiences. By bringing high-quality international and regional works to Singapore audiences, the Biennale also helps to develop the local arts scene and place Singapore on the global arts map. We appreciate the feedback and ideas from the arts community and the public. Through ongoing dialogue and reflection, we will continue to review how the Singapore Biennale can best serve artists, audiences, and the wider cultural landscape.

Forum: Clamp down on advertisers making exaggerated weight loss claims,"Jan 13, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 13, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Advertising and marketing', 'Healthcare']","Iam concerned about the increasing prevalence of misleading weight loss advertisements in Singapore. It is reported that there have been more overweight and obese individuals in our society in recent years. Yet at the same time, more people are becoming health-conscious and are actively seeking ways to lose weight. According to the Health Promotion Board and healthcare experts, the only proven and sustainable way to lose weight is by controlling ones calorie intake and engaging in regular physical exercise. However, despite this well-established medical consensus, advertisers, including some established brands, continue to make baseless and misleading claims about rapid and effortless weight loss programmes. Some advertisements aired on national television claim that one can lose up to 7cm of waistline in just 30 minutes. Such claims are unrealistic and scientifically impossible. Similarly, radio advertisements can be heard promoting treatments that allegedly allow consumers to continue eating whatever they enjoy without the need for exercise, promising weight loss without any form of diet control or physical activity. While Singapore has a regulatory framework governing advertising standards, enforcement appears to be lax. As a result, advertisers seem increasingly emboldened to make even more ludicrous and unsubstantiated claims, misleading consumers who may already be vulnerable or desperate to lose weight. I urge the authorities to strengthen enforcement of existing advertising regulations and take firm action against advertisers who disseminate false or exaggerated claims. The mainstream media can also do its part by advising advertisers to correct their exaggerated claims before they are broadcast. Doing so will help protect consumers and uphold the integrity of public health messages in Singapore.

(Jan 6) – that rings so true as well. My only grouse with it is that it has come a number of years too late. The implication is that the damage has been done, and it is to the reputation of the Singapore visual arts scene at that. Unlike the writer, I am a big fan of contemporary art. While she dutifully susses out the ins and outs of the Singapore Biennale because of faith in the centrality of art to life, I am in it for the sheer love of it – until I fell out, that is. It was after just a few iterations of the Singapore Biennale that I realised that the vision, curation and organisation as well as the general quality of the artworks left much to be desired. Many of the editions of the Singapore Biennale have been notable for the wrong reasons. Much of the second edition (2011) was held at the Old Kallang Airport, which was not only far from the other venues, but also dingy, dusty and stuffy. This same Biennale saw the censorship of British artist Simon Fujiwaras installation Welcome To The Hotel Munber by the Singapore Art Museum after being shown for two days and without any consultation with the artist. The 2022 edition of the Biennale was bizarrely named Natasha, purportedly to create a sense of familiarity. This concept largely fell flat and is not likely to be repeated here or anywhere. Other than these missteps, I am hard-pressed to recall any venue, theme or artwork from the Singapore Biennale sparking any meaningful conversation. Out of the eight editions, I enjoyed only An Atlas of Mirrors (2016). One out of eight aint bad, you say. But when huge sums of public money are involved, with no or barely any accountability, as there has not been any single artistic director at the helm for two editions, and with generally lacklustre art, and presentation and organisation that dont do anything for Singapores reputation as a visual arts hub, the Singapore Biennale really doesnt have anything going for it. Being held every two or three years notwithstanding, it is time to call it a day for the Singapore Biennale.

The names of the halls have been retained as a nod to The Projector. While the cinema will get a new coat of paint, some murals – a distinctive feature of the former venue – will be retained. Again, to recognise the link to the past, adds Ms Tan. Filmhouse is expected to hold a soft opening in late January or early February. The name was chosen because we wanted to create a home for films and film lovers, she says. The Projector was known for its food and beverage options, which included cocktails and other alcoholic drinks. Whether a licensed bar will return is still being worked out, but when Filmhouse opens, there will be a snack bar serving cinema snacks and soft drinks. Films expected to be screened at the soft launch include the Norwegian-language drama Sentimental Value, winner of the Grand Prix at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, and the Chloe Zhao-directed period drama Hamnet, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal and winner of Best Motion Picture – Drama at the 2026 Golden Globes. The comedy-drama Rental Family, starring Brendan Fraser, will also be in the line-up. Ms Tan says the team is excited to be back. Right now, we are rushing to get things ready to welcome guests. It feels like we are coming home – were looking forward to seeing our friends and regular patrons, she adds. Ms Tan is part of the team that founded The Projector in 2014, afterwards becoming its first general manager. Mr Walter Navarro, who was for nearly a decade the head of programming at The Projector, will take the same role at Filmhouse. Alumni of The Projector are also filling other roles. The new cinema will screen a mix of new releases and curated foreign, art-house and retrospective films, and will partner embassies holding national film festivals. The owner of Filmhouse, who wants to remain anonymous, is a cinephile who was a regular attendee at screenings held at The Projector. He appears to be undeterred by the current en-bloc negotiations for Golden Mile Tower, a situation that has made extensive renovations at the ageing cinema financially risky. Ms Tan says he comes from outside the film industry, with no background in either the leisure or lifestyle businesses. After 10 years in business, The Projector ended operations suddenly in August 2025, entering voluntary liquidation after accumulating about $1.2 million in debt. The closure left film fans reeling, as it had not just been a place for them, but also for those drawn to live performances, such as its deejay and comedy nights. These were held at both its original Golden Mile Tower location and later at its offshoot at Cineleisure in Grange Road. The Projectors closure left indie film distributors in the lurch, among them Mr Thomas Chia, director of Lighthouse Film Distribution. He had come to depend on The Projector team for its generous terms, unlike mainstream cinemas which tend to be focused on the bottom line. Mr Chia says that while the name has changed, he is glad the people he has worked with are back. They are the heart and soul of the operation. My relationship with them, the goodwill and trust that embassies have built with the team through their national film festivals – that is something that money cannot buy. He hopes that supporters of The Projector will visit Filmhouse in numbers sufficient to keep the new venue afloat, adding: Sentimental Value, Hamnet and Rental Family are great films to kick off operations. Lets hope the patrons will return and spend some money.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/new-indie-cinema-filmhouse-to-open-at-the-projectors-former-space-at-golden-mile-tower
Oscar-winning film-maker Paul Haggis reaches $2.6m settlement after 2022 rape verdict,"Jan 12, 2026, 04:59 PM","Jan 12, 2026, 04:59 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/3bc3b5db4ac4c6bdc2af545834fc0ac3c84a4337aaeaa134dedfda5278ae34a3,Canadian film director Paul Haggis was initially ordered to pay her at least US$7.5 million.PHOTO: AFP,"['Me Too Movement', 'Rape', 'Movies']","NEW YORK – Oscar-winning film-maker Paul Haggis has agreed to pay nearly US$2 million (S$2.6 million) to settle a lawsuit from a former film industry publicist who in 2022 won a rape trial against him. The lawsuit, which Ms Haleigh Breest filed in the early months of the #MeToo movement, said that in 2013, Haggis invited her to his loft in New York, where he forced her to give him oral sex, penetrated her digitally and raped her. The 72-year-old Canadian, who won Oscars for the movie Crash (2005), which he co-wrote and directed, was initially ordered to pay her at least US$7.5 million. The settlement, which was signed in December 2025, said both parties had amicably resolved all disputes between them and that Ms Breest would file a legal document known as a satisfaction of the amended judgment, indicating that the required amount had been paid. Under the terms of the settlement, he agreed to pay US$1.9 million. Haggis, who did not face criminal charges in the case, maintained that the sexual encounter with Ms Breest had been consensual. After a 15-day trial in the Manhattan Supreme Court inthe fall of2022, a six-person jury sided with her, finding him liable for rape. She had testified that she had felt pressured to go to his apartment and have a drink that night because of his stature in Hollywood. At the time, she said in a statement that she was grateful for the opportunity to seek justice and accountability in court. Ms Priya Chaudhry, a lawyer for Haggis, said at the time that the defence was disappointed and shocked by the trials outcome. During the trial, lawyers for Ms Breest sought to convince jurors that her communications shortly after the sexual encounter made it clear she had viewed it as an assault. The defence zeroed in on messages from her that took a morelight-heartedtone, along with others that expressed her desire to see Haggis again. His lawyers also argued that she was lying about the encounter to extract money from him during a time when the #MeToo movement had heightened public sensitivity around sexual assault allegations. They pointed to a text in which she told a friend: I need to get something out of this at least. Ms Breest began her case against Haggis shortly after he denounced Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced American film producer, as numerous accounts of his sexual harassment and abuse were published in The New York Times. During the trial, she testified that Haggis was the definition of hypocrisy.NYTIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/oscar-winning-film-maker-paul-haggis-reaches-2-6m-settlement-after-2022-rape-verdict

Peridot, on the 38th floor and facing Victoria Harbour and Centrals skyline, sports a pale-green, cocoon-like interior that evokes the gemstone it is named after. Hundreds of small lights perfectly aligned from floor to ceiling add to the peculiarity of the place. The impressive bar in the middle of the room is a giant slab of green marble. Its interior is done by design firm Studio Paolo Ferrari, known for its luxurious and immersive decors and behind projects including the futuristic Shebara Resort by the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia. Mr Francois Cavelier, a mixologist who dedicated his career to French-Japanese fusion and formerly of The Peninsula and Rosewood, was hired to take the helm as beverage director. Mr Lisandro Illa is the Argentinean chef behind the plant-based (and literally green) menu. He is also the co-founder of a Madrid-based art gallery focused on the link between culinary and visualarts. On a late Monday afternoon, the place was packed. Of course, it would be. It is at sunset that you can see and feel how the space changes as the sunlight vanishes outside. Once it is night-time, the interior illumination contrasts with the external lights of the city. Remember, the wow effect is part of the experience. The bill cametoHK$1,073.60(S$180) forfour drinks, two appetisers and service. The vibe:Chic and casual, this place is definitely more Dubai and less Hong Kong. A DJ was playing the nightmy guest and I visited, but the music – including some 1980s classics – did not quite match the space. We would return to hear a musician at the keys of the futuristic-looking grand piano. Whos next to you:Groups of young professionals dressed in trendy clothes, many who would be at home at a vernissage in Central during Art Week, plus office workers who just got off the clock. Can you conduct a meeting here?:Not really. The tables are fairly small, and the music was too loud when we visited. But you can certainly come for a happy hour drink with a visitor you want to impress. There is also a private room behind the bar for fancier gatherings What we would order again:Any of the drinks – they were impeccable. My guest was delighted by the Durians Consent, which paid respect to the polarising fruit in a fine combination with Cuban and Jamaican rum. I enjoyed my Yuzus Reply, a bitter and citrusy combination of gin, Akayane yuzushu, Campari and lemon. We both loved the golden sparassis mushroom fries, which were crunchy, flavourful and gorgeously presented. Need to know:Peridot is at Summit 38, the 38th floor of The Henderson, 2 Murray Road in Central. From Mondays to Thursdays, it is open from noon to 1am; on Fridays and Saturdays, it is open until 2am. After 5pm, reservations are accepted only for parties of six people or more with a deposit.

The case involves two boys who were actors on a television set in the state, where the 68-year-old was acting and directing. The warrant, signed by a Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court judge in Albuquerque, approved the arrest of Busfield, court records show.He was not in custody as at the night of Jan 9,said Detective Chase Jewell, a spokesperson for the Albuquerque Police Department. Busfield was charged with two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse after two child actors said he had touched them inappropriately over a period of years, a police affidavit said. The boys, who are both 11 and related, were part of the crime drama The Cleaning Lady (2022 to 2025), for which Busfield was an executive producer and an actor. One of the boys said Busfield had touched his genitals starting when he was seven, according to the affidavit. Busfields lawyer and agents did not immediately respond to requests for comment early Jan 10, nor did representatives at Warner Bros., which produced the show. Busfield won an Emmy Award for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for his performance in Thirtysomething, which aired for four years on ABC beginning in 1987. Busfield, who is married to American actress Melissa Gilbert, is also known for his portrayal of a journalist on political drama The West Wing (1999 to 2006). The police investigation into Busfield began in 2024 after officers responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital, where staff members requested a sexual abuse investigation. One of the boys told a therapist, apaediatricianand a forensic interviewer that Busfield had entered the bedroom on the television set and touched his penis and buttocks over his clothing, the affidavit said. In October, the boys mother reported to child protective services that both children said Busfield had touched them between late 2022 and early 2024, according to the affidavit. It added that Busfield acknowledged to the police in a phone interview that he probably tickled the boys, describing the set as a playful environment. He suggested that the allegations were a form of revenge by the boys mother after the children were terminated from the show, the affidavit said.NYTIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-director-timothy-busfield-husband-of-actress-melissa-gilbert-accused-of-child-sex-abuse

Shares of Walmart climbed 3 per cent, boosting to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, where the retail giant moved its stock listing last month from the NYSE. Consumer staples rose 1.4 per cent and led sector gainers, while technology also increased. Walmart is set to join the Nasdaq-100 index on Jan 20, a shift that could draw in billions of dollars from passive index funds. Stocks had opened lower on the news surrounding Mr Powell. The Justice Departments threat of indictment, ostensibly focused on comments Mr Powell made to Congress about a building renovation project, ramped up concerns about the Feds independence. Mr Powell called the move a pretext to gain more influence over interest rates that President Donald Trump has pressed to cut sharply since he took office in January 2025. The news that Powell is being investigated by the Justice Department was basically telegraphed by Trump, and so I think the market is taking it in stride for now, said Mr Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The fact that you had former Fed governors come out in support of Powell ... is also comforting to markets, he said. Investors also are looking ahead to the fourth-quarter U.S. earnings season, Mr Cardillo said. Analysts see the technology sector leading S&P 500 earnings growth for the quarter, with a 26.5 per cent year-over-year gain, according to LSEG data. They see overall S&P 500 companies earnings for the quarter up 8.8 per cent from a year ago. The reporting period unofficially begins on Jan 13 with results from JPMorgan Chase and other big banks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 86.13 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 49,590.20, the S&P 500 gained 10.99 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,977.27 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 62.56 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 23,733.90. Shares of lenders and credit card firms came under pressure after Mr Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10 per cent starting on Jan 20. Financials were down 0.8 per cent on the day and led sector decliners in the S&P 500. Citigroup tumbled 3 per cent, while credit-card firm American Express fell 4.3 per cent. Consumer finance firms also dropped, including Capital One, which ended down 6.4 per cent. Buy-now, pay-later firm Affirm Holdings fell 6.6 per cent. Investors also await Jan 13s US consumer price index report, which could influence the outlook for Fed rate cuts. Markets for now are betting on at least two more quarter-point cuts before year-end, according to LSEG data. Volume on US exchanges was 17.29 billion shares, compared with the 16.40 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.68-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 725 new highs and 48 new lows on the NYSE.

The deal announced on Jan 12 marks a major vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsungs Galaxy AI, but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apples installed base of more than two billion active devices. After careful evaluation, Apple determined Googles AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models, Google said on X, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features. Alphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed. The iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its devices, allowing the companys Siri voice assistant to tap into the chatbots expertise to answer complicated questions. Apple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters request for comment. This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X. Mr Musk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure. Jan 12s tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAIs partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a code red to push teams to accelerate development. Apples decision to use Googles Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer, said CEO of Equisights Research, Parth Talsania. Google has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAIs early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and image and video generation. Apple has faced a series of setbacks on the AI front after being late to the race, with Siris upgrade getting delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception. The latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple. News of the deal helped power Alphabets market valuation above US$4 trillion (S$5 trillion) on Jan 12. The stock, up 0.5 per cent in afternoon trading, jumped 65 per cent in 2025 on growing investor optimism about its efforts including its latest Gemini 3 AI model. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apples industry-leading privacy standards, Google said on Jan 12, in a move to ease privacy concerns.

Under the conditional voluntary takeover offer, Sunway has proposed to acquire IJM at RM3.15 a share – a 14.6 per cent premium to IJMs last closing price of RM2.75, and between 17.6 per cent and 28 per cent over its volume-weighted average market prices across the past one, three and six months. The deal is aimed at unlocking synergies and building a national champion with greater scale and capability, while generating spillover effects across industries including real estate and construction, said Datuk Anuar. The merged entity is expected to have a market capitalisation exceeding RM47.7 billion, surpassing peers such as Gamuda and KLCC Property, and placing the group among the top 10 companies on Bursa Malaysia. Both companies announced share trading suspensions on Jan 12. Sunway shares closed at RM5.60 on Jan 9, while IJM shares last traded at RM2.75. Both companies will resume trading on Jan 13. The offer will be satisfied by a 10 per cent cash payment, with the remaining 90 per cent settled through the issuance of new Sunway shares at RM5.65 each. For instance, a shareholder who has 1,000 IJM shares will receive RM315 in cash and about 501 Sunway shares. At the offer price, the transaction values IJM at an implied enterprise value-to-Ebitda multiple of 11.8 times, and a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.4 times, based on IJMs audited earnings for the year ended March 31, 2025. Titan in the making Mr Anuar said the combined talent pool is an asset to the company, noting there are no layoff plans following the merger. We expect everyone to remain in their roles and continue delivering value, he said.Large-scale mergers among Malaysian property and construction groups are rare, but not unprecedented.In 2010, UEM Land Holdings, backed by sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional, launched a landmark nearly RM1.4 billion takeover of Sunrise. The deal, completed in 2011, led to the creation of UEM Sunrise. The offer is conditional on Sunway securing acceptances that would lift its ownership above 50 per cent of IJMs voting shares, as well as obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals and approval from Sunway shareholders. Diversified group Upon completion, if IJMs public shareholding spread falls below the prescribed requirements following the offer, Sunway said it may seek to delist IJM. UBS Singapore branch has been appointed international financial adviser for the offer; Maybank Investment Bank is acting as principal adviser to Sunway. IJM is a diversified group spanning construction, property, industry and infrastructure, with IJM Land among the countrys largest township and mixed-use developers.Its Johor portfolio includes the Sebana Cove integrated golf, marina, resort and residential township near Pengerang, as well as urban residential projects such as Austin Duta in the Johor Bahru growth corridor.The group has developments across Penang, Greater Kuala Lumpur, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak. Sunway, meanwhile, is anchored by its build-own-operate township model. In Johor, its flagship Sunway City Iskandar Puteri spans about 730ha along the Iskandar Puteri waterfront. The group is also developing a RM4 billion transit-oriented mixed-use project with MRT Corp at Bukit Chagar, positioned to benefit from the upcoming RTS Link to Singapore. Regionally, Sunway has expanded aggressively in Singapore through its Sunway MCL arm. After the landmark RM2.4 billion acquisition of Hongkong Lands MCL Land business in 2025, the groups attributable project value in the city-state surged to nearly RM15 billion. Sunway has also unveiled plans to list its healthcare arm by March 2026 in a deal expected to raise more than RM3 billion, potentially marking Malaysias largest IPO since 2017.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/malaysias-construction-giants-sunway-ijm-corp-halt-trading-is-a-mega-merger-imminent

Drawing on 56 detailed proposals consolidated into 18 recommendations, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and its knowledge partner, PwC Singapore, outlined five key priorities for the Government to consider in shaping the 2026 fiscal Budget. At a media briefing on Jan 12, SBF chief executive Kok Ping Soon said the proposals were grounded in findings from the chambers business surveys, industry feedback, as well as insights gleaned from theongoing Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce and Economic Strategy Review. Though Singapores economygrew 4.8 per cent in 2025, the Governments slower 1 per cent to 3 per cent projection for 2026 reflects caution, Mr Kok said, noting that some factors that fuelled growth in 2025 may dissipate this year. Growth in 2025 was boosted by the front-loading of exports in anticipation of US tariffs, which have yet to be determined for the pharmaceutical and semiconductor sectors. These two sectors collectively account for about 40 per cent of Singapores exports into the US. The truce between China and the US will come to an end sometime in November, so we really dont know whats going to happen, he noted. SBF and PwC are among the organisations and individuals making recommendations for the upcoming 2026 Budget since the Finance Ministry started collecting views from Dec 2. Finance Minister and Prime Minister Lawrence Wongwill deliver the Budget statement on Feb 12. More than half of last years recommendations made by SBF and PwC, which are partnering for a second year, were taken up, said Mr Kok. This years report spotlights new areas that we think are worth paying attention to. One is that whole chapter about capturing new growth, he said. IP financing, carbon trading, and the opportunity to hasten regional economic integration as Singapore prepares to assume the Asean chair in 2027 were among them. Compared to 2025, workforce transformation has taken a back seat in this years recommendations. Not that its not important, but it was a big chunk of what we proposed last year, Mr Kok said. The Government has introduced various new programmes to support workforce transformation, so I think we should allow some time for them to be implemented. PwC Singapore executive chairman Marcus Lam said companies now grapple with decisions on where to invest, what to automate, how fast to decarbonise, and which markets to double down on. One idea is toexpand the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zoneto include Indonesias Riau Islands Batam, Bintan, Karimun to make it more attractive to global investors. Mr Lam also mooted the creation of a digital IP collateral registry, with the Government adding another boost by widening its risk-sharing schemes to cover IP-backed loans with higher ratios of 70 per cent to 80 per cent. He said: One impediment to our ambition to be an innovation hub is our limited ability to use IP as financing collateral. We identified a few reasons for this. One is the lack of valuation expertise amongst our financial institutions. Two is a preference among our financial institutions for traditional forms of collateral like property and equipment. But places such as China, Hong Kong and South Korea are advancing IP financing initiatives, and Singapore should keep up, he said. The partners would also like to see the current productivity solutions grant (PSG), administered by Enterprise Singapore to help small and medium-sized enterprises digitalise, be made more accessible. Mr Lam said the PSG currently helps smaller firms procure mostly pre-packaged software solutions in sales or back office from pre-approved vendors. But as these businesses progress to AI agents or more advanced uses, what they need are customised solutions and sustained AI support. On decarbonisation, the partners are calling for the set-up of a carbon transition council to develop industry best practices and road maps, and for the Government to extend the Enterprise Financing Scheme – Green beyond March 31. SBFs chief policy and operating officer Musa Fazal said: We know that the carbon tax is going up this year, and quite significantly, from $25 to $45 per tonne. This will have an impact on businesses, either directly for the heavy carbon emitters, or indirectly for the rest of firms, through energy prices. On employment, even as the partners asked for more incentives to enhance hiring of older workers, they also made a case for more foreign workers in civil engineering, manufacturing and logistics, where not enough Singaporeans are willing to take up its jobs. Six recommendations to boost senior employment were made, including encouraging flexible and fractional work, supporting smaller businesses to cope with higher health and insurance costs of older workers, and nudging business culture towards a less ageist environment. On inclusive growth, PwC Singapores corporate tax leader Tan Ching Ne called for better support for hiring among vulnerable communities and more incentives to promote corporate volunteering. Tethered to that is a request for support for initiatives to integrate foreign talent into the Singapore workforce. The ideas here ranged from orientation programmes for employment pass holders, a central online repository of integration resources for companies, and training courses on local-foreign workplace integration. Mr Kok said: Weve included it because we think that if we do not address the us against them sort of underlying tensions in Singapore, it will reduce our economic potential. So how can we increase the absorptive capacity of Singapore for foreigners? I think thats important.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/budget-2026-sbf-pwc-list-out-18-recommendations-to-strengthen-spore-economy

In a strongly-worded statement on Jan 11, Mr Powell disclosed aprobe that threatened him with criminal indictmentover a building renovation project, saying it was a pretext to gain political influence over the Fed to lower interest rates faster. US President Donald Trump told NBC that he had no knowledge of the Justice Departments actions, but renewed his attacks on Mr Powell that have grown more frequent and pointed as the Fed has chosen to cut rates more slowly than he would have liked. The investigation and Mr Powells pointed response sharply escalates a row that market observers fear risks upending the independence of the Fed, a bedrock of US economic policy and a cornerstone of its financial system. It also highlights how heavily the Trump administrations efforts to reshape institutions from the military to the judiciary are now coming to bear on a pillar of US financial strength. TheUS dollar was down- albeit modestly - against every major currency during the Asia session on Jan 12. Gold shot to a record high, US stock futures dropped and markets priced in a slightly higher chance of short-term interest rate cuts. Fed chair Powell has deviated from his previous approach to Trumps threats, this time choosing to directly address the elephant in the room - that the Fed is not moving rates as the President would like, said Damien Boey, portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management in Sydney. The ability of central banks to move, at least in setting interest rates, without political interference is considered a key tenet of modern economics - insulating monetary policymakers so they can make decisions for long-run stability. For investors, trust in US institutions forms part of the so-called exorbitant privilege that the country enjoys in financial markets as the issuer of the worlds reserve currency and recipient of billions of dollars in capital inflows. Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto pointed to unintended consequences of leaning on the Fed. By trying to influence the central bank through aggressive legal threats against individual officials, the administration could drive inflation expectations higher, erode the dollars safe-haven role, and trigger a sharp rise in long-term bond yields that raises borrowing costs across the American economy. Pouring gasoline everywhere and then playing with matches tends not to work out well, he said. Mr Powells pushback is in some sense a parting shot, since his term as chair is due to end in May and Mr Trump has already promised his nominee as successor will be someone who believes in lower interest rates, by a lot. But his stand will be a frame for any replacement and serve as a yardstick for shifts in the Feds approach. Richard Yetsenga, ANZs group chief economist, said that for the US financial markets in their entirety, the operation of all three of the Feds policy arms is likely to be in flux - rates, the balance sheet and banking sector regulation. Its definitely too early (to tell), but the trends seem quite clear ... the technocratic Fed, as we have understood it over the past few decades, is fading from view, he said. Meanwhile, investors, already starting to wonder whether their portfolios are over-allocated to the United States, are on notice about the new kinds of risks the Trump administration is ushering in. To be sure, the market moves were small on Jan 12 and some saw little clear consequence for interest rates and even as a sign that Mr Trump actually lacked influence over the Fed. Investors wont be happy about it, but it shows actually Trump has no other levers to pull, said Andrew Lilley, chief rates strategist at Australian investment bank Barrenjoey. The cash rate will stay what the majority of the FOMC wants it to be, he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. Still, nagging doubts about the freedom of the Fed to move as it sees fit in the future are now planted in investors minds. I think Im still not sure how sustained and adversarial the attack on the Fed might be, said Vishnu Varathan, head of macro research for Asia ex-Japan at Mizuho in Singapore. (But) the Fed independence question is now well and alive and maybe subject to re-evaluation every few meetings.

The white paper, published by the World Economic Forum, IMD Business School and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), found that uncertainty levels in 2025 were more than four times higher than during the 2009 global financial crisis and about 50 per cent above the peak of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The findings were based on the International Monetary Funds Global World Uncertainty Index and the World Trade Uncertainty Index. The study, which drew on 56 interviews with senior executives across industries and regions, warned that mounting risks facing the global economy have made volatility the new normal. Senior executives pointed to shifting trade patterns, the erosion of multilateral frameworks, and the growing use of economic instruments as weapons as risks to business stability and competitiveness. The most commonly cited geopolitical risks includedUS policy volatility and tariffs; Russias ongoing war against Ukraine; intensifying US-China rivalry; and concerns over Europes long-term competitiveness. Rivalry between the US and China is widely expected to remain intense as they compete to be No. 1 in technology and the economy. New breakthroughs in artificial intelligence will fuel that rivalry. Despite rising risks, less than 20 per cent of companies have a dedicated geopolitics or international relations department, the study found. While most boards and C-suite leaders are aware of the risks, most companies still lack integrated processes that connect geopolitical shifts with strategic decisions on investment, sourcing and sales. Too many companies treat geopolitics as a headline issue rather than a business capability, said Dr Nikolaus Lang, global leader of the BCG Henderson Institute, vice-chairman of the BCG Center for Geopolitics, and co-author of the report. Companies tend to be reactive, treating geopolitics on an ad hoc basis, rather than anticipative, and miss out on opportunities to mitigate risks effectively. He said this model was no longer sustainable. The growing frequency and overlap of shocks now call for geopolitical strength and a structured approach to detect change, recalibrate and respond decisively at scale. While a source of risk, geopolitics also creates opportunities for companies able to navigate it effectively. Potential mitigation measures include diversifying suppliers, adjusting production footprints and identifying partners or markets that require contingency planning, the report said. Companies that develop these capabilities are better able to sense, adapt and build long-term resilience, said Mr Sean Doherty, head of international trade and investment at the World Economic Forum. The study said there is no single model for building geopolitical resilience. A companys success depends on how well its structure, scale and strategy fit its ambitions across different markets and contexts. Success depends on aligning corporate strategic ambition and organisational structure, the study said. It added that a companys geopolitical team must have direct access to leadership to ensure speed and authority in moments of disruption.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/businesses-ill-equipped-even-as-global-uncertainty-hits-20-year-high-davos-study-warns

Gold, meanwhile, broke through US$4,600 an ounce for the first time, while silver also hit a record high, as investors snapped up safe havens due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties and growing bets on US interest rate cuts after the ramped-up attack on the Fed. The escalating tension in the US is fuelling market anxiety over the central banks autonomy. The US dollar index fell as much as 0.3 per cent in Asia trading, snapping a five-day winning streak, with the greenback weakening against almost every major currency. The sell-off revives debate over just how far a US president can and should influence the nations rate stance, which in recent decades have been insulated from political interference to ensure price stability. It is also reviving questions on whether investors should reduce exposure to US assets and the dollar – a theme that dominated global markets in April 2025 when President Donald Trump announced universal tariffs. Mr Trump seems adamant about exerting control over the Fed, potentially undermining the Feds monetary policy independence, said Ms Fiona Lim, a senior foreign exchange strategist at Maybank in Singapore. Trumps impatience and resolve to get borrowing costs lower suggest that his pick for the next chair could be a dove and a loyalist and that could be a risk to the greenback, she said. Spot gold rose as much as 2 per cent to a record peak of US$4,601.17 an ounce. It was last up 1.5 per cent at US$4,577.46. Spot silver was up 3.5 per cent at $82.72 an ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $83.96 earlier in the day. Mr Powell in a video statement on Jan 11 said the Trump administration had threatened him with a criminal indictment over his congressional testimony on renovations of the Feds headquarters, an action that Mr Powell called a pretext aimed at putting further pressure on the Fed to lower rates. Mr Trump has repeatedly slammed Mr Powell on social media, urging rate cuts and at one point threatening to fire him – before later backing off and denying he ever considered it. Powell has had enough of the carping from the sidelines and is clearly going on the offensive, said Mr Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney. This open warfare between the Fed and the US administration – and to the extent that you take Powells comments at face value – its clearly not a good look for the US dollar. Earlier on Jan 12, the dollar had advanced in early Asian trading after Jan 9s jobs report bolstered expectations the Fed will hold interest rates later this month, while reports of hundreds of deaths during protests in Iran heightened geopolitical tensions and stoked demand for safe havens. The deadly protests in Iran have increased the haven appeal of precious metals, with the possibility that the Islamic republic could be overthrown injecting uncertainty into geopolitics and oil markets. Mr Trump said on Jan 11 he was mulling over potential options on Iran, while also reiterating threats to take Greenland and questioning the value of the NATO alliance, just over a week after seizing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Its a reminder of how many uncertainties markets are juggling – geopolitics, the growth/rates debate and, now, a fresh headline-driven reminder of an institutional risk premium, said Ms Charu Chanana, a strategist from Saxo Markets in Singapore. Gold just emerged from a record-setting year, where almost every tailwind supporting the precious metal combined, from falling interest rates and heightened geopolitical tension to lower trust in the US dollar. More than a dozen money managers said they had opted not to take too much money off the table, holding conviction in bullions long-term appeal.

The offerings include a pet insurance product recently rolled out with MSIG Insurance and Seas digital financial services arm, Monee. But as online marketplaces play a bigger role in insurance distribution, questions around governance and oversight of these digital sales channels are coming into sharper focus. A Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) spokesperson told The Business Times that financial institutions may distribute their products and services through various channels, such as agents and... the use of digital media. In September 2025, the regulator publishedguidelines on standards of conduct for digital advertising activities,setting out expectations for financial institutions to exercise strong governance and close oversight over their digital advertising activities. These developments come as insurers and financial services firms increasingly partner e-commerce platforms to reach consumers. Shopees recent pet insurance offering included free coverage of one month, with a plan providing coverage of up to $100 for outpatient and inpatient treatment resulting from accidental injury. The plans are available from as low as 20 cents a day. MSIG and Monee said Shopees 12.12 campaign generated an encouraging response for the pet insurance product in the light of growing demand for accessible pet insurance, but did not give details. Mr Steven Leong, head of retail distribution at MSIG Singapore, said the move reinforces its commitment to making insurance accessible and part of everyday life. The pet insurance product is distributed by MoneeInsure Agency on Shopee Singapore and underwritten by MSIG Insurance. MSIG said Shopee itself functions only as a marketplace, and the insurance page on the platform is owned and operated by MoneeInsure Agency. All insurance-related queries are directed to MSIG, indicating a separation between the e-commerce platform and insurance operations, in alignment with regulatory expectations. MoneeInsure Agency, the insurance unit of Monee, is registered with the General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) as a general insurance agent, as is required, to ensure accountability. Industry players said that as the principal insurer, MSIG is responsible for ensuring that the agency meets professional and technical standards when marketing insurance products to the public. Beyond pet insurance, Shopee already distributes other insurance offerings. MSIGs travel, motor and personal accident insurance products are available on the platform. The distribution of insurance on Shopee is not a new phenomenon. In 2025, Peak3 and Lazada announced a collaboration with insurers, including AIA, Astra, Income Insurance, MSIG and Sompo, to offer insurance products in property and casualty, accident and health, and life segments. It was announced at the time that the plan was to roll out insurance offerings in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. When asked by BT about the take-up rate so far, Lazada declined to comment. Not all e-commerce platforms, however, are taking a direct role in insurance distribution. Carousell said it does not distribute insurance products as an underwriter. While it previously had a limited partnership with an insurer for auto-related products, this involved linking users to the insurers website rather than allowing applications to be completed directly on its platform. Insurance distribution in Singapore is governed by the Insurance Act, which defines the parties who may act as insurance agents and the requirements they must meet, GIA said. Under the Act, a person or company is generally considered to be acting as an insurance agent if they receive insurance proposals or issue policies, collect premiums, arrange insurance contracts, earn commissions tied to premium values, or provide insurance sales or product advice. To ensure accountability, individuals and businesses must register with the GIAs Agents Registration Board (ARB) through the principal insurers they intend to represent before distributing general insurance products. In the case of the new pet insurance product, MoneeInsure Agency is registered with GIAs ARB as a general insurance agent of MSIG. Only life insurance agents are licensed by MAS, as life insurance products tend to be more complex and have longer tenors, therefore increasing the potential impact of misconduct. The GIA has cautioned that parties who act as insurance agents without proper registration may be referred to MAS for enforcement action under the Insurance Act. The regulatory framework also recognises different types of insurance agents, including individual agents, corporate agents and trade-specific agents whose main business is not insurance. Members of the public can verify an agents registration status and check for authorised insurers through the ARBs online search function. Against this regulatory backdrop, industry observers say the expansion of insurance sales on e-commerce platforms is likely to continue, driven by insurers push to meet consumers where they already transact. MSIG and Monee said they will continue to build on the momentum of the pet insurance launch through ongoing marketing efforts, including the continued offer of a complimentary one-month plan.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/e-commerce-platforms-such-as-shopee-expand-into-insurance-drawing-closer-regulatory-scrutiny

Brent crude futures edged up 0.08 per cent, or five cents, to US$63.39 a barrel by 12.33pm Singapore time, after jumping almost 6 per cent over Jan 8 and 9. US West Texas Intermediate crude inched up 0.07 per cent, or four cents, to US$59.16 a barrel. President Donald Trump said that the US is closely monitoring the protests in Iran and is mulling over potential options as the Islamic republic faces its third week of nationwide protests, the largest since 2022. Were looking at it very seriously. The military is looking at it, and were looking at some very strong options, Mr Trump told reporters on Jan 11. Well make a determination. He also touted a meeting with Tehran. The possibility of a disruption to Irans daily exports of almost two million barrels has tempered concerns over a global glut that caused a slump in prices and made investors increasingly bearish. The scale of risk has shown up clearest in options markets, where the skew towards bullish calls is the biggest for US crude futures since July. The unrest is the most significant challenge to Irans Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, since a nationwide uprising in 2022. It follows a surge in oil prices during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, which quickly eased after the US intervened and brokered a peace deal. The Iranian turmoil has also shifted the focus away from Venezuela. Mr Trump on Jan 10 signed an executive order to safeguard the Latin American countrys oil revenue held in US Treasury accounts from the nations creditors, but broader political uncertainty could still suppress much-needed investment. Unless the Iranian protest actually disrupts exports or shipping, the market will mostly fade it, said Mr Haris Khurshid, chief investment officer at Karobaar Capital in Chicago. Nevertheless, the bar for a volatility spike is low, he said. The US President on Jan 9 summoned leaders of oil majors, including Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, to a summit at the White House to discuss Venezuela. There, Mr Trump pledged US$100 billion (S$128.6 billion) of the companies capital towards rebuilding the oil sector in Venezuela, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, even as executives expressed caution and Exxons head called the nation uninvestable. Mr Trump said in response that he might block Exxon from investing in Venezuela. Meanwhile, Ukraine targeted three drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea owned by Russian oil major Lukoil, in the latest move to weaken Moscows access to funds to fuel the almost four-year-old war.

The Hungarian opened Liverpools account with a long-range screamer in the ninth minute after Barnsleys Davis Keillor-Dunn had bounced a header off the home upright inside the first 30 seconds. Right back Jeremie Frimpong, on his FA Cup debut, unleashed a tremendous left-footed effort in the 36th to put Liverpool 2-0 up at a chilly Anfield. Szoboszlai then veered from the sublime to the ridiculous in a moment of jaw-dropping carelessness that handed Barnsley a lifeline in the 40th minute. Seemingly attempting to backheel to goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, the Hungarian instead left the ball perfectly teed up for Barnsleys Adam Phillips, who spent eight years in Liverpools academy, to lash home at the Kop End. Liverpool made it 3-1 in the 84th when second-half substitute Florian Wirtz made amends for a glaring earlier miss by curling a shot into the top right corner to put the outcome beyond doubt. Hugo Ekitike, also coming off the bench, added the icing on the cake with the fourth assisted by Wirtz in the fourth minute of stoppage time. The hosts, who suffered a shock fourth round defeat last year to second-tier Plymouth Argyle, showed they were taking the game seriously by fielding a stronger than expected starting lineup. Manager Arne Slotmade six changes in his starting lineupto the side that drew 0-0 at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Jan 8. Barnsley still made it hard for them, fighting for every ball and fuming at being denied a penalty in the 61st minute when forward Reyes Cleary went down after a challenge from Szoboszlai with no VAR until the fifth round. Barnsley manager Conor Hourihane was booked for his reaction and said after the game that Szoboszlai had also been disrespectful in attempting the botched backheel. I dont think a player does that against Chelsea against Arsenal or in a Champions League game. Im a little bit disappointed with that to be honest, said the Irishman. Slot gave that short shrift, without sparing his player: What does he mean disrespectful? I dont think you should do that in a Premier League game, League Cup game, friendly game or a training session, said the Dutchman. Its a weird choice and I also have my opinion about it but I prefer to keep that to myself and speak about it with Dom. Szoboszlai apologised to the team: I made it hard for us with the easy mistake, I would say. Football happens, we move on. We go to the next round, he told TNT Sports. We wanted to show we take the FA Cup seriously. We showed today we need the whole squad, they also showed quality. We need everyone.

Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-Imagn ImagesREUTERS","['PGA Tour', 'Brooks Koepka', 'CEO']","Jan 12 - Brooks Koepka is returning to the PGA Tour after applying for reinstatement following his departure from LIV Golf, but his comeback comes with a potential $85 million price tag under a new program announced by the U.S.-based circuit on Monday. Former world number one Koepka, who joined LIV in 2022, parted ways with the Saudi-funded circuit last month and applied for PGA Tour reinstatement after notifying officials that his previous affiliation had concluded, PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp said in an open letter to fans. The Returning Member Program is only open to golfers who have won a major or The Players Championship since 2022 and comes with what Rolapp called one of the largest financial repercussions in professional sports history. That leaves Bryson DeChambeau (2024 U.S. Open), Spaniard Jon Rahm (2023 Masters) and Australian Cameron Smith (2022 British Open) as the only other LIV players who meet the PGA Tours performance-based criteria for reinstatement under the program. CLOSER TO HOME Due to strict limitations that Koepka has agreed to, the five-time major winner faces a five-year forfeiture of potential equity in the PGA Tours Player Equity Program, representing an estimated $50-85 million loss depending on his performance and tour growth. Koepka, one of a number of high-profile golfers who accepted lucrative signing bonuses to join LIV, also agreed to make a $5 million charitable contribution with recipients to be determined jointly with the PGA Tour. Being closer to home and spending more time with my family makes this opportunity especially meaningful to me, Koepka, 35, said on social media. I believe in where the PGA Tour is headed with new leadership, new investors, and an equity program that gives players a meaningful ownership stake. I also understand there are financial penalties associated with this decision, and I accept those. Koepka also said he will make his PGA Tour return at Torrey Pines Golf Course for the January 29-February 1 Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego. He last played a regular PGA Tour event in March 2022. FEBRUARY 2 DEADLINE The program also includes heavy and appropriate limitations to both tournament access and potential earnings, though specific details werent provided. Rolapp emphasised the program will not take away playing opportunities from current members - fields will be expanded as needed. Other eligible players have until February 2 to apply for reinstatement. This is a one-time, defined window and does not set a precedent for future situations, Rolapp warned. Once the door closes, there is no promise that this path will be available again. The move reflects fan demand for top competition, Rolapp said: One thing has been clear across each of those conversations - you all want the best players in the world competing against each other more often. OPEN ECOSYSTEM At the 2023 PGA Championship, Koepka became the first player to win a major championship while a member of LIV Golf. LIV Golf responded to the PGA Tour news with a statement in which it said its vision to grow the game globally has not changed. From the outset, LIV Golf has championed an open ecosystem and freedom, for all. Not just for a limited few, LIV Golf said. One that supports players rights to compete across various platforms, reinforcing the belief that the growth of the game is best served when the games best players are empowered to seek the most competitive environments around the world.

Pape Bouna Thiaw leads Senegal against Egypt, coached by their prolific former striker Hossam Hassan, in the first semi-final in Tangiers on Wednesday, followed by hosts Morocco, under Walid Regragui, against Nigeria, who have ex-Mali international Eric Chelle on their bench. The only other time the final four sides were managed by Africans was in 1965, and African coaches have long complained they are often overlooked for national team jobs in favour of Europeans or South Americans with mediocre credentials. There have often been situations where African coaches have not been able to get jobs because federations and clubs prefer Europeans, but that seems to be changing a bit, said former Ghana international Kwesi Appiah, who led Sudan to a last-16 place. He was one of three African coaches taking charge of a team different from his own nationality at the finals in Morocco – a new phenomenon for the tournament. I think there is a responsibility too for the African coaches to prove their worth with hard work, Appiah told Reuters. This is the third successive Cup of Nations where African coaches outnumber foreigners. In Morocco, there have been 14 African managers, nine from Europe and one from Argentina. Foreign coaches had previously dominated with only six of the first 32 editions of the tournament boasting a majority of local coaches. Many European coaches have launched their careers in Africa but only a handful have returned to high-profile jobs in their own countries, like Roger Lemerre, who spent time managing in Tunisia before winning the 2000 European Championship with France, and Philippe Troussier, who had a brief and unsuccessful stint at Olympique de Marseille after working in five different African nations and Japan. When it comes to lifting the trophy, however, the statistics favour African coaches who have masterminded 18 Afcon titles to 16 for teams coached by foreigners. Africas number will increase again after Sundays final. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/african-coaches-to-the-fore-at-cup-of-nations

An independent FA regulatory commission said in partly redacted written reasons that it considered the midfielders actions to have been highly violating and intentional foul play. The commission did not accept the players view that neither of the acts were intentional, it added. The Commission recognised that there was no plausible explanation to be touching an opponents private body parts during a game (especially when the match itself was not in motion). The incidents happened during the League Two (fourth-tier) sides League Cup 2-1 first round loss at Cardiff City last August. Clarke, 33, was also fined 2,750 pounds ($3,701) when he was banned last month after maintaining his innocence. Swindon condemned the ban at the time, saying in a statement that it believed the decision falls short of the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt and was instead based on the balance of probabilities. As a club captain, Ollies character and integrity have never been in question, and he continues to have the full support of the club, the management, and his teammates.

Xabi Alonso will always have the love and admiration of all Real Madrid fans because he is a Real Madrid legend and has represented the values of our club at all times. Real Madrid will always be his home, the club said in a statement. They added that second-team manager and former defender Alvaro Arbeloa will take over the first team job. Real parted ways with Alonso a little more than seven months after appointing him, following a poor run of results in all competitions. Former Real midfielder Alonso, who was handed a three-year contract in May after an impressive stint with Bayer Leverkusen, saw his tenure at the Santiago Bernabeu quickly unravel. The former Spain international had guided Leverkusen to a historic unbeaten campaign to win the Bundesliga title in the 2023-24 season, along with a German Cup triumph and a Europa League final appearance, prompting Real to bring him back to the club as manager. However, Alonsos return failed to replicate the success of a fellow former Real Madrid midfielder, Zinedine Zidane, who famously led the club to three consecutive Champions League titles. His tenure was marred by internal discord, with reports of clashes with senior players, including co-captain Federico Valverde and winger Vinicius Jr. Reals poor performances under Alonso included humbling losses to Paris St Germain in the Club World Cup, to Atletico Madrid in LaLiga, and Liverpool and Manchester City in the Champions League. Arbeloa will take over the job immediately and will be on the sidelines on Wednesday as Real visit second-division side Albacete in a Copa del Rey round of 16 tie. After leading LaLiga earlier in the season with a comfortable five-point advantage over old rivals Barcelona, Alonsos Real collapsed and are now second, four points behind last years champions Barca. Alonsos appointment was initially seen as a long-term project, but his dismissal signals the clubs impatience with Real falling short of their high standards. The 44-year-old, who made 236 appearances for Los Blancos as a player between 2009 and 2014, won a LaLiga title, two Copa del Rey trophies, and the clubs long-awaited 10th European crown during his years in midfield. Alonso also began his coaching career at Reals academy, managing the Under-14 side to league and tournament success in the 2018-19 season, before progressing to Real Sociedads reserve team and then Leverkusen. His successor, Arbeloa, has been the coach of Real Madrid Castilla since June 2025 and has spent his entire coaching career in the clubs youth academy since 2020. Arbeloa played for Real during one of the most successful periods in the clubs history, between 2009 and 2016, playing 238 matches and winning eight titles, including two Champions League trophies. He was also in the Spain squad that won the 2010 World Cup and two European Championships, making 56 international appearances.

He also won the Ottawa marathon in 2019 and 2025. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said in October that Kenya had made significant progress in tackling doping, but the country remains on a six-month probation while it seeks to improve its monitoring. That month saw Ruth Chepngetich, the current world marathon record holder, banned for three years after admitting the use of hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic used as a masking agent. Running is a way out of poverty for many in Kenya, putting pressure on many to turn to drugs, especially since the country lacks the sophisticated infrastructure to train stars. Kenya worked to clean up its image after a string of doping scandals around the 2016 Rio Olympics led to it being declared non-compliant by WADA. More than 140 Kenyan runners, mainly long-distance runners, have been sanctioned for drugs offences since then. In June 2024, Kenya handed out its first lifetime ban to marathon runner Beatrice Toroitich and a six-year ban to 10km record-holder Rhonex Kipruto.
