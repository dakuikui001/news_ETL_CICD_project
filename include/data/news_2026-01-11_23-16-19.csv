"Seniors in Singapore visit the dentist less often, are at risk of growing more frail: Study","Jan 12, 2026, 05:04 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:04 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/298daaf37300ca2991de66c7d86eb6ccd6d745ba2a2eaff0176503072ebf8a85,A recent nationwide longitudinal study showed that only around a quarter of the seniors had visited a dentist within the past six months.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO,"['Ageing', 'Senior citizens', 'Scientific research', 'Duke-NUS Medical School']","SINGAPORE – As they grow older, Singaporeans visit the dentist less often, get lonelier and face the risk of becoming more frail. This was revealed in a recent nationwide longitudinal study that showed only around a quarter of the seniors had visited a dentist within the past six months, while nearly one-third had not seen a dentist in more than five years. It is possible that people only visit the dentist when they have a problem, but they may not consider prevention as something they could engage in, in the context of dental health, said Associate Professor Rahul Malhotra. The deputy director of the Centre for Ageing Research and Education at Duke-NUS Medical School is the first author of the latest tranche of the Transitions in Health, Employment, Social Engagement and Inter-generational Transfers in Singapore (The Signs) study. With recent research and policy focus on oral health, and research studies highlighting its link to other health and social outcomes, a dental module was added to this study round, he said. Theintroduction of new dental subsidiesunder the CHAS card presents a good opportunity to increase awareness among older adults about the importance of regular dental check-ups, he added. A total of 1,535 seniors aged 67 to 101, of whom 64 were aged 90 and above, were surveyed. They are part of the original cohort recruited for study in 2016-2017. The results were published on Dec 30, 2025. This round of the study – Wave 3a – was funded by the Ageing Planning Office at the Ministry of Health. Such studies offer insights that would help shape interventions aimed at helping Singapores rapidly growing senior population maintain health and social connection to age well. The Signs study observed that approximately half of the community-dwelling seniors exhibit frailty, ranging from mild to severe, with two-thirds found to have only very mild frailty. This is based on a threshold proposed in the National Frailty Strategy Policy Report, as an alternative classification commonly used internationally has a higher threshold for classifying frailty. Prof Rahul said this group of pre-frail seniors should focus on muscle strengthening and maintaining a balanced diet to prevent getting weaker. As seniors age, they also often experience increased loneliness, with nearly one in four reporting being mostly lonely. The proportion of mostly lonely seniors was higher in those aged 80 and above, slightly higher in women, and higher for Malays and Indians, among the three major ethnicities. Other areas of concern that the study highlighted include low cancer-screening uptake, increased depressive symptoms, reduced social networks, lower digital inclusivity among the oldest-old, and lower feelings of trust and camaraderie within residential neighbourhoods. These would require prompt action as the nation continues to age, the study authors said in their conclusion. Furthermore, the oldest-old, aged 80 and older, which is the fastest-growing segment of the older adult population in Singapore, consistently reported poorer status across multiple physical, social and psychological health indicators. So far, cancer-screening rates have remained below 50 per cent among seniors. For instance, only one in three Singaporean women aged 67 to 69, and one in four aged 70 to 79, had undergone a mammogram to screen for breast cancer within the past two years. This is despite the recommendation for all women aged 50 or older to undergo screening for breast cancer through mammograms once every two years, unless advised otherwise by a medical professional. When it comes to psychological health, clinically significant depressive symptoms were observed among 16.5 per cent of older Singaporeans. This proportion increased with age and was higher for women (20 per cent) and Indians (24.3 per cent), the study found. It also found that some 39 per cent of seniors were at risk of social isolation, with the proportion higher for those aged 80 and above as well as for men. When it came to vaccination uptake, it was observed that while some 91 per cent of older adults had taken three or more doses of Covid-19 vaccination, only about 60 per cent of them had taken the influenza vaccine in the past 12 months and about 53 per cent had ever taken the pneumococcal vaccine. This is despite the increased efforts, such as public awareness campaigns and vaccine subsidies, to encourage the uptake of both vaccines among older adults, said Prof Rahul. The study also found that just over half of the seniors felt that they had enough money to meet their needs, while 55.1 per cent of seniors received monetary support from family members or other people. The receipt of support increased with age, and women were more likely than men to receive most types of support, except housework help. Meanwhile, only 7.4 per cent of older Singaporeans were informal caregivers, with the proportion falling with age. It was higher for women and Malays. While some 47 per cent of them reported feeling moderately to extremely burdened by their caregiving role, a bigger proportion found positive aspects. Some 86 per cent of the seniors reported feeling more useful and nearly 86 per cent reported appreciating life more because of caregiving. Meanwhile, data collection for Wave 3b of The Signs study has been completed, with the results expected to be out before the end of the year, said Prof Rahul. Wave 3b involved interviewing a new sample of approximately 5,300 older Singapore residents, aged 60 and above. Crucially, the researchers will be able to compare the new findings with previous research, allowing them to examine how the ageing process among older adults may be changing over generations.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/seniors-in-singapore-visit-the-dentist-less-often-are-at-risk-of-growing-more-frail-study
"CES 2026: Health tech firms showcase wearables, portable gadgets for self-monitoring and care","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/77bc5c595c4b8af09441933f3979419aeba9abcd3cd96bd181e7d86a68cee4b7,"The Straits Times walked the CES show floor to highlight five digital health products that caught our eye, including an exoskeleton by Chinese company Dnsys.ST PHOTO: SARAH KOH","['Health and well-being', 'Technology and research', 'Wearable gadgets']","LAS VEGAS– From smart rings and AI-powered massage chairs to robots that promise to keep your grandparents company – you name it and it was probably on display at CES 2026. Theworlds largest annual tech trade showwas held in Las Vegas recently, with digital health products a highlight during the massive four-day event that spanned 2.6 million square feet – the size of several convention centres and hotels. Straits Times tech reporter Sarah Koh showcases five digital health products that could be part of your future healthcare arsenal. The CES show floor was filled with exoskeletons – but Chinese brand Dnsys attracted long queues of people eager to try out its X1 model, which stood out for its sleek design that also looked the least bulky. It has straps that wrap around a users waist and thighs, and curved carbon rods that allow users to bend and rotate their knees comfortably. Weighing 1.6kg, this is one of the lightest models in the market. A control device at the side recognises the users gait and intent in real time. As he or she is about to lift a knee, the motor assists with the upswing to lift the thigh, and pushes the leg through the swing. This action reduces pressure on the knees when walking, running, or hiking, and helps users conserve up to 50 per cent of energy and reduce joint pain, according to the company. More than 10,000 units of the X1 have been sold worldwide since Dnsys was founded in 2021, at about US$1,000 (S$1,280) each. The firm has received more than US$3 million through two crowdfunding rounds, which has gone into development and production costs, company representative Li Xiangyu told ST on the show floor. In its early days, the company was initially focused on selling to businesses such as hospitals, before an experience with a five-year-old patient nudged it to the consumer market, said Ms Li. He struggled to walk after undergoing brain surgery and was able to do so after putting on our exoskeleton, added Ms Li, who noted that the boy refused to return the set afterwards. While the exoskeletons main function is to make movement easier, the company said it can help users recover from injury as they strengthen muscles by increasing resistance levels. Mr Benedicte Astiers daughter went into an anaphylactic shock from an allergic response after eating, and the Frenchman resolved to find a way to enable people to test food for allergens. Enter Allergen Alert – a handheld device that allows users to test food items instantaneously by dropping a small food sample into a single-use pouch, which is then inserted into the device. Within minutes, the device will alert users on whether the sample contains either gluten or lactose – two of the most common allergens worldwide. The device, which the firm described as a pocket-size mini laboratory, is based on patented technology from bioMerieux laboratory, which specialises in diagnostic instruments and solutions. The team worked to miniaturise and automate every step of a professional test, which includes sample preparation and protein extraction. Such tools are important given how common food allergies are worldwide, said marketing representative Stephane Laurain. An estimated 220 million people globally have food allergies, according to statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The device is slated to launch in France later in 2026, with international expansion plans to come after. Restaurants in Lyon, France, are already testing and using this device, with chefs using them to test food items when crafting a menu, said Mr Laurain. Though the device can test for only two allergens currently, the team is working towards expanding this to the big nine – which includes wheat, soya, fish, shellfish, eggs, sesame, peanuts and tree nuts. These allergens are behind 80 per cent of allergic reactions. Beyond food allergies, the firm also has plans to include testing for allergens in cosmetic products, said Mr Laurain. Finger pricking and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are widely used by diabetic patients to measure their blood glucose levels – but one Singapore firm is hoping to launch a smartwatch soon that can do the same job in a non-invasive manner. With optical sensing technology, Sensuras smartwatch uses light shone into the veins of a users wrist, where different substances within, such as glucose, would reflect different electromagnetic spectrums that are picked up and analysed with the use of artificial intelligence. Clinical trials done at a hospital in China have shown positive outcomes, said Sensura co-founder Rick Liang, adding that the company is in the midst of doing more validation tests with the South-east Asian population. From our early studies, we dont think skin colour affects the effectiveness of the device, said Mr Liang. But we will need to conduct multiracial tests in order to receive licences from the authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Health Sciences Authority. This convenient manner of measuring ones blood glucose continuously allows patients to keep track of long-term data, and is also preferable to an invasive method such as finger pricking. A CGM, which is minimally invasive and sits just under the skin, is less painful but needs to be changed every two weeks. A set of monitors that lasts four weeks costs around $150 on average. A demonstration of the smartwatch showed Mr Liangs blood glucose to be at 5.9 millimoles per litre, while his CGM device showed his levels to be at 6.1 millimoles per litre. The team, which has headquarters at the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory at the National University of Singapore, plans to launch its smartwatch later in 2026 after more clinical validation has been completed. Mr Liang declined to share its retail price but said it would be kept affordable when compared with current measurement methods. A handheld device that uses the same technology will also be launched in the next three years, said Mr Liang, who added that the firm is in talks with several hospitals in Singapore to trial the device, without naming them. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the healthiest of them all? Another product that drew queues of curious attendees was NuraLogixs newly unveiled Longevity Mirror, which gives users a reading of their health markers just by looking at it. The mirror, which has a built-in camera at the top and light on its sides, captures a 30-second video of the users face and analyses changes in the blood flow within key areas such as the chin, cheeks and forehead. The results would then show the users blood pressure levels, heart rate, stress levels, skin age and predictive measurements such as the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Users are then given a longevity score. When setting up the mirror, users must first enter their age, height, weight and if they have a history of illnesses such as diabetes. Armed with this information, the mirror would be able to account for other changes, such as weight loss within the facial area over time. The mirror is priced at US$899 with a US$99 yearly subscription fee after the first year of service. For an extra US$399 per year, users can also get connected with health professionals for further analysis and receive health advice. For women who suffer from heavy bleeding or painful cramps during their menstrual period, a wearable device that sends low electrical pulses to ones nerves might give some relief. OhmBodys US$599 device is touted to help reduce heavy bleeding, discomfort from cramps and the length of menstruation. Hydrogel patches connected to the device via wires are attached to the front and back of the users ear, where the vagus and trigeminal nerves are located. The vagus nerve is known to influence ones mood and energy levels, while the trigeminal nerve helps to regulate pain. Users are advised to use the device two hours daily when they have their period to feel its effects, and the level of pulses can be controlled via the device. A peer-reviewed clinical trial was conducted in the US, which involved 16 women with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding. After they wore the patches for two hours daily during menstruation, their blood loss was reduced by 50 per cent, the company said. Their menstrual duration was also shortened by around 20 per cent, and there was a 45 per cent reduction in discomfort from cramps. Participants also reported improved comfort, sleep quality, mood and productivity. The device is considered a wellness tool and has not received approval from the FDA. A larger clinical study involving 80 participants will be done in February to further validate the effectiveness and safety of neurostimulation and menstrual support, said OhmBody vice-president of strategic growth Amy Gaston. The device is currently available only in the US, with plans for international expansion in 2027. Today, big firms and start-ups alike are working to release products that fit consumers health needs while being as unobtrusive as possible. This is a far cry from 2022, when digital health products formed a small footprint on the show floor, said Mr Steve Hummel, the Consumer Technology Associations director of market research. Devices like smartwatches that track health metrics, translate that to data for a practitioner to receive in real time – what were really seeing is the democratisation of health overall, said Mr Hummel, adding that he expects to see this trend continue to grow in the future. There has also been a rise within the space in agentic AI, which allows agents to understand a users needs and routine to recommend health and wellness tips. A cross between this and the surging popularity of robotics could mean assistive robot caretakers in the long run, which can be especially useful given that many countries are facing ageing populations, said Mr Hummel.",https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/ces-2026-health-tech-firms-showcase-wearables-portable-gadgets-for-self-monitoring-and-care
Singaporean of the Year finalist: He built Woodlands Botanical Garden to help others seek comfort,"Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:22 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d230d59cfa321baf3409b3e466c5f253febeb0cd3478f9eb0f4f81a16366125a,Mr Ganesh Kumar created one of the largest community gardens in Singapore.ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY,"['SOTY 2025', 'Singaporean of the Year', 'Singaporeans', 'ST Events']","SINGAPORE – In the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Mr Ganesh Kumarplanted a pink hibiscus plantto help him overcome the grief of losing his mother. What began as a small gesture of healing later transformed into a thriving garden in Woodlands that is now one of the largest community gardens here. The 41-year-old, who was suffering from depression, hopes that others can also find solace and joy in the garden he so painstakingly built. Being in their shoes, I understand just how difficult it is, and I thought, why not create a space like a sanctuary for everyone, he said. One question I got the most often was, What are you going to plant next? That idea that people put in my head helped me forget the sadness I was going through… It gave me a sense of purpose. They shared with me how happy they were that there was some colour now (in the garden) instead of just green, and then I realised, why not share these same colours, which brought me happiness all these years, with other people. Located on the northern slope of Woodlands Town Park East, Woodlands Botanical Garden (WBG) used to be a barren nine-storey-high hill covered with grass and lalang, with few signs of fauna. It was initially just a 50 sq m garden managed by Mr Ganesh, his father and his helper at the time. Today, with the help of some volunteers, the garden spans 4,000 sq m and is home to over 350 plant species and 300 animal species, including multiple vulnerable species in Singapore, he said. Some of the plants housed there include the Pink Mussaenda, Yellow Candle Bush, Yellow-Red Tecoma, Red Single Camellia and Yellow Pagoda. Various species of butterflies also flit from flower to flower. The garden has even attracted a Fiery Coraltail damselfly, which is rare here. WBG is one of the largest community gardens under the National Parks Boards gardening programme, Community In Bloom. Mr Ganesh is a finalist for The Straits Times Singaporean of the Year award, which is given to a Singaporean or group of citizens who have made a significant contribution to society. This can be through achievements that put Singapore on the world stage, or by going beyond the call of duty to selflessly improve the lives of others in the community, among other ways. Now in its 11th year, the award is organised by The Straits Times and presented by UBS Singapore. Since he was young, gardening has been a family activity Mr Ganesh did regularly with his parents and grandparents, who used it to instil in him the value of being responsible and caring for things. He said gardening has helped shape him as a person and inculcated values such as humility in him. When he started adding more plants to the garden, many people began to strike up conversations with him, and friendships bloomed. I realised that so many people had stories to share… (They) were coming out, and I was happy because I wanted them to come out more, he said. Mr Ganesh hopes the garden can be a safe space where everyone feels at ease and can build friendships. Beyond just a garden, WBG has also transformed into a community space that hosts some 20 major events yearly, such as cultural concerts, biodiversity talks and pet walks. Besides using the space for volunteers to give biodiversity talks at the garden alongside experts in the field, Mr Ganesh, a former music teacher, also offers it to budding artists to host events. WBG has also teamed up with Human-Animal Bond In Ministry (HIM) – a social enterprise that uses animal-assisted intervention to help prisoners and former offenders, among others – to provide former offenders with a small allowance for working in the garden under an activity on the Desistor Network, a Singapore Prison Service initiative. Building the garden is not without challenges. To focus on WBG, Mr Ganesh, who is single, quit as a graduate research officer and took a pay cut to teach chemistry at a tuition centre. Besides giving up his PhD candidacy in material science engineering at Nanyang Technological University to focus on building the garden, he also sold his dream car, a Jaguar XJ, to fund the installation of a pond at the garden. Another challenge he faces is the seeds and flowers from the garden being stolen, and some plants and trellises being destroyed. Even so, he has no intention to fence up the garden as this would defeat the purpose of it bringing joy to people. I have made many sacrifices, but I have no regrets. I will do them all over again if I have a second chance, Mr Ganesh said. My hope for WBG is for it to be just an example for other parks… I just wanted to set up a space as an example for other spaces as well.

"Fewer property agencies, slower agent growth amid rising costs, tighter anti-money laundering rules","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d275835a0bd4c88f4d53973ad45d398cda72132fa70d3e7c669800b106587067,Data from the Council for Estate Agencies showed there was a drop of about 10 per cent in the number of property agencies over the past three years.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI,"['CEA/Council for Estate Agencies', 'Property market/sector', 'Singapore property']","SINGAPORE – The number of property agencies here is dropping amid rising operating costs and stricter regulatory requirements, and slower overall growth in the number of property agents. Latest figures from open government data portal Data.gov.sg showed that the number of property agencies with valid registrations fell by 47 from 2025, taking the total down to 998 as at Jan 1, 2026. Data from the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) public register showed there were 1,118 agencies at the start of 2023, so the decline represents about a 10 per cent drop over the past three years. Despite the fewer agencies, the number of registered property agents grew by 2.15 per cent year on year to about 36,835 agents as at Jan 1, easing slightly from the 2.2 per cent growth recorded the previous year and 2.4 per cent in 2024, Huttons Data Analytics figures showed. Industry players attributed the drop in the number of agencies and slower agent growth to rising operating and advertising costs, tighter anti-money-laundering (AML) compliance requirements, higher training obligations and retirements among older agency owners. Under theexpanded framework, which took effect on July 31, 2025, property agents must conduct stricter due-diligence checks on both clients and unrepresented parties in a transaction, and verify sources of funds for high-risk deals. They are required to guard against proliferation financing – the provision of funds for the illicit development and supply of weapons of mass destruction and related materials. The CEA said the changes align with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force. After considering the feedback from the industry, property agents and agencies were given more time to familiarise themselves with the new rules. CEA expects transactions to fully comply with the revised requirements from Jan 1, 2026. Mr Mark Yip, chief executive of Huttons Asia, said rising compliance costs linked to stricter AML rules are adding pressure on smaller agencies. Demographic factors are also at play, with the key executive officers of some boutique agencies in their 60s and 70s deciding to retire. The increase in continuing professional development requirements – from six to nine hours in 2025 to 16 hours in 2026 – and mergers for cost efficiencies are also contributing to exits and consolidation, said Mr Yip. After running Chronicles Realty as the sole operator for more than 30 years, Madam Irene Tan, 77, shuttered the agency at the end of 2025. She said: For the past few years, I had been relying on my friend to help me with the checks. But the stricter requirements require a lot more paperwork and screening of clients. I am not familiar with the process and I cannot keep asking friends for help. Advertising expenses have also climbed, squeezing margins further, added Madam Tan. Hence, when her agencys registration with CEA expired in December 2025, she decided not to renew it. Instead, she joined Ripton Realty, which let her focus on sales while they supported her with the paperwork and compliance checks for a share of her sales commissions, said Madam Tan. Mr David Sing, 75, who ran Asia USA Realty (Singapore) Asiahomes.com on his own, similarly chose to shut his agency and retire in 2026 after the stricter AML rules came into force. He cited the growing burden of paperwork and compliance checks. Ms Alicia Chua, key executive officer of Ripton Realty, said besides Madam Tan, four agents joined the firm from another agency that shut in 2025. Ms Chua, who runs the agency with 41 agents, said overheads have risen steadily in recent years, with agencies needing to provide more administrative support and training while absorbing higher marketing and operating expenses. She added that AML screening fees were already up significantly even before the enhanced rules kicked in. Unlike large agencies, smaller firms also have to subscribe to multiple external platforms to access transaction data, as they do not have the economies of scale to develop their own in-house digital systems, further adding to costs, said Ms Chua. Mr Justin Quek, deputy group chief executive of Realion (OrangeTee & ETC) Group, said agencies today are not only navigating rising operating costs and tighter regulatory and compliance requirements, but also intensifying competition driven by evolving consumer expectations and more complex business needs. These pressures can be more challenging for smaller firms with limited resources, while some mid-sized agencies may choose to merge in order to achieve greater operational resilience, said Mr Quek. As at Jan 7, PropNex Realty maintained its position as the largest agency with more than 14,000 registered agents. Mr Eddie Lim, chief agency officer of PropNex, said the agency recorded a net growth of 1,310 salespersons, or a 10.37 per cent year-on-year increase from Jan 1, 2025. Mr Lim expects the number of agencies to continue shrinking over the next three to five years as consolidation continues. Agencies with strong (economies of) scale, robust compliance frameworks, and the ability to invest in technology and training will be better positioned to operate sustainably amid rising costs and regulatory expectations, said Mr Lim. ERA is the second-biggest with 8,468 agents, followed by Huttons Asia with 5,784 agents. OrangeTee & Tie is in fourth place with 2,559 agents, while SRI is fifth with 1,630 agents, according to data from the CEA portal.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/fewer-property-agencies-slower-agent-growth-amid-rising-costs-tighter-anti-money-laundering-rules
NParks drawing up advisory on how to shield marine mammals from coastal development noise,"Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/af92075ce7eaf01c08ec1c52ffb9181b6bbfad71e59245d29984413cdeaa3ce7,"The carcass of a critically endangered dugong found off Pulau Hantu on Oct 9, 2021.PHOTO: ROBERT TAN/FACEBOOK","['Marine life', 'Science', 'National Parks Board', 'Environmental issues', 'Sustainable living/development']","SINGAPORE –Developers undertaking marine works in Singapore waters will get guidelines designed to reduce underwater noise, in a move to protect the Republics elusive marine mammals. The National Parks Board (NParks) is drawing up an advisory that informs developers on ways to avoid harming creatures such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and the dugong that frequent Singapores coastal waters, The Straits Times has learnt. This comes as more coastal development projects are in the pipeline as Singapore combats rising sea levels and reclaims more land. In the coming decades, for instance, it is planning to reclaim about 800ha of land off East Coast Park to develop Long Island. Industry consultants said the advisory will ensure thatunderwater noisehere is dealt with systematically, instead of leaving its management to the discretion of developers. Underwater noise is an invisible but potent stressor for marine mammals, which rely heavily on sounds like clicks and trills to communicate and navigate. Man-made noise can mask these signals, cause severe stress and impair the hearing of these creatures. Due to the vastocean habitatof marine mammals, it is difficult to track the implications of underwater noise pollution. However, studies show that sonar use has altered the feeding behaviour of blue whales and stranded others on beaches. Dr Karenne Tun, group director of NParks National Biodiversity Centre, told ST that the measures could advise developers to gradually ramp up the intensity of marine piling works – a noisy process that involves driving piles deep into the seabed – while ensuring that no marine mammals are in sight. This soft start approach gives marine mammals a crucial window of time to flee the area before noise levels increase further. She did not mention when the advisory will be ready. The development of the advisory follows a recent study by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) who compiled all reliable records of marine mammals in Singapores territorial waters from 1820 to 2024 to identify their hot spots. Mr Sirius Ng, the papers lead author, noted that the research was initiated to establish a baseline for Singapores wild marine mammals. Because of the paucity of this data, policies protecting marine mammals tend to focus on the general marine environment, rather than being ecologically tailored for the species themselves, he said. The study found that Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were mainly observed within the Southern Islands. The average sizes of their pods also declined, a trend that appeared most evidently over the past three decades. Dugongs were most commonly spotted at the Sungei Johor Estuary, notably Changi, Pasir Ris and Pulau Ubin, where two international shipping channels meet. Surprisingly, the paper found that over time, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins tended to appear in areas closer to urban areas with higher vessel activity, adapting to human activities in ways that are still not fully understood. Dr Tun said NParks plans to study these important findings, which complement a separate project by NUS researchers that monitored the vocalisations of marine mammals between 2019 and 2022. That project, funded by NParks, sought to understand the distribution of marine mammals in Singapores coastal waters as well as guide development activities in the waters. In particular, results from (the acoustic project) highlighted that waters off both Sisters Islands and Kusu Island recorded the highest number of vocal detections of dolphins in the southern waters of Singapore, playing a key factor in safeguarding this location as the second marine park, said Dr Tun. Singapore announced its first marine park to conserve the biodiversity at Sisters Islands in 2014, and revealed in 2024 plans for a second one at the southern part of Lazarus Island and the reef off Kusu Island. Dr Tun said the acoustic research project emphasised the need to account for the impact of sound in the planning and staging of marine works. Industry consultants said the advisory will also help Singapore develop its environment responsibly while avoiding delays and reputational concerns arising from negative acoustic impact on fauna. Ms Holly Siow, head of ecology at environmental consultancy DHI Water & Environment, said the advisory will give much-needed clarity and consistency for developers, elevating acoustic impact to a core component of marine development planning. From a developers perspective, this also reduces regulatory and project risk, she added. When expectations around acoustic mitigation are clearly articulated upfront, developers can factor them into project design and scheduling early on, rather than responding to issues later during approval or construction. Singapores coastal waters are rich in marine biodiversity, and ensuring mitigation is targeted where it matters most is essential to balancing development with conservation, she said. Ms Siow called on NParks to consider embedding noise-related standard operating procedures into tender specifications for environmental impact assessments, as well as environmental monitoring and management plans. Mr Lee Adam Harryman, head of the Climate Resilience Studio at CPG Consultants, said the advisory should lead to better coordinated projects, fewer late changes and closer alignment between environmental safeguards and engineering delivery. He noted that measures to manage underwater noise are commonly built into project approval processes at the government level in some countries abroad. He added that Singapores approach is encouraging because it is grounded in local, science-based research. This ensures the measures are tailored to Singapores waters and marine species, rather than simply adopting overseas standards. NParks move to draw up an advisory is consistent with practices in jurisdictions with established marine construction activity, such as Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States, where more sophisticated guidelines are already in place, the consultants said. In Europe, standard measures include deploying marine mammal observers for high-risk activities, and bubble curtains – technology that uses veils of air bubbles to dampen sound waves, according to Ms Siow. As the Republic looks to the future, the integration ofacoustic monitoringcan play a key role in long-term coastal management, said NUS researchers Hari Vishnu and Koay Teong Beng, who had worked on the acoustic monitoring project. Acoustics can especially play an important part in assessing the effects of anthropogenic events such as oil spills, or development projects around Singapores waters, said Dr Vishnu, citing the technologys ability to monitor at scale. Mr Koay noted that while their initial study covered the majority of expected biodiversity hot spots, it did not cover the entire Singapore coastline. They said: Our study was done over a period of 2.5 years, so it would make sense to extend this to more continuous and longer-term monitoring so that our observations are not just limited to this period.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/nparks-developing-advisory-to-shield-singapores-marine-mammals-from-noise-of-coastal-works
"GLS sales, commercial deals lift Singapore 2025 property investment to $40 billion","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/76f42bb289bad8dc10a2762380d42731b0a98ed15f3236e0a78297aa97a2b495,Real estate consultant Knight Frank Singapore said that total investment sales in 2026 are expected to remain robust at around $30 billion.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO,"['Property investments', 'Land planning/Land sales', 'Singapore property', 'Property market/sector', 'Private property']","SINGAPORE – Property investment activity in Singapore hit a new eight-year high of $40 billion in 2025, fuelled by robust participation in Government Land Sales (GLS) tenders and more commercial transactions as interest rates eased amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty. This surpassed the previous peak in 2017, when $35.5 billion was recorded due to a collective-sales boom and strong institutional demand. It also exceeded Knight Frank Singapores forecast of $27 billion to $30 billion, the real estate consultant said in a report dated Jan 8. 2025 was a year of relative political and economic volatility and uncertainty, yet investment sales in Singapore surged to a new record. Investors committed to deals as interest rates eased, a testament to Singapores continued position as the Switzerland of the East, said Mr Galven Tan, chief executive of Knight Frank Singapore. Given the global uncertainties and trade tensions that weighed on the economy throughout the year, it was serendipity that led investment funds to be deployed, Knight Frank said, adding that total investment sales in 2026 are expected to remain robust at about $30 billion. On an annual basis, total investment activity jumped 36.8 per cent to $40 billion in 2025, with commercial investment deals accounting for $17 billion. Residential transactions accounted for $14.6 billion, industrial deals accounted for $6.2 billion, and the remaining $2.2 billion came from mixed development, hotel and other transactions. Significant commercial investment transactions included Hongkong Land Holdings $3.9 billion transfer of its stakes in Marina Bay Financial Centre Towers 1 and 2 and One Raffles Quayinto a Singapore-based private real estate fund. Other notable transactions included Keppel REITs acquisition of a one-third stakein Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3for $1.45 billion; Lendlease Global Commercial REITs 70 per cent stake purchase of Paya Lebar Quarter Mall, which has an agreed property value of $885 million; and the sale of The Clementi Mall to the Elegant Group for $809 million. These deals reflect sustained investor confidence in strategically located, income-generating commercial assets with strong occupancies, Knight Frank said. In the residential sector, investment deals totalled $14.6 billion, a 20.8 per cent increase from 2024. Spurred by strong homebuyer demand at new launches, more developers began participating in residential GLS tenders, with top bids becoming more competitive as the year progressed, Knight Frank noted. In the fourth quarter of 2025, residential state land tenders contributed $3.1 billion, or more than 70 per cent of the residential sectors overall transaction value, which came to $4.3 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in the third quarter. Six GLS sites totalling $4.6 billion were awarded in the fourth quarter,including the first residential site in the former Keppel Club areaat $918.3 million, and an integrated mixed-use site in Hougang Central that fetched $1.5 billion, said Ms Catherine He, head of research at Colliers Singapore. In addition, 10 good class bungalows were transacted, with one in Peirce Road going for $148 million, and a land plot in the Marina Square complex transacted at $99.1 million, as part of a residential redevelopment there. The strong investment momentum is likely to spill over to the luxury market, with buyers, especially ultra-high net worth individuals, benefiting from higher liquidity in the capital markets and lower borrowing costs, she added. Meanwhile, the collective sales market remained subdued in the fourth quarter, with just one deal. Starpoint, a nine-unit project, was sold for $55.3 million to education service provider Stalford International Education in November. This brought the total in 2025 to five deals (three residential and two industrial developments), up from four in 2024. Home replacement costs remain a major deterrent to collective sales, Knight Frank said. Private home prices have risen 38 per cent in the past five years, making it difficult for en bloc sellers to secure comparable replacement homes. Higher stamp duties further discourage foreigners and permanent residents, as selling would expose them to significant taxes when buying a replacement property, the consultancy said. In the industrial sector, transaction values dipped to $6.2 billion in 2025, from $6.6 billion in 2024. Among the biggest transactions were CapitaLand Ascendas REITsacquisition of three industrial and logistics propertiesfor $565.8 million, as well as ESR-REITs divestment of eight Singapore industrial assets for $338.1 million.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/gls-sales-commercial-deals-lift-singapore-2025-property-investment-to-40-billion
Singaporean of the Year finalist: Leaving a well-paying job to unburden hoarders,"Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:23 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/4a1ad4641178becfd07cd7b5a55b29108505077567cd30a9507aa48f85241db5,"Mr Steven Goh , whose non-profit Helping Joy helps transform lives through the work of decluttering homes, is a finalist for the Singaporean of the Year 2025 award.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI","['SOTY 2025', 'Singaporean of the Year', 'Hoarding']","SINGAPORE –Mr Steven Goh was standing at a pavilion waiting for a client when an elderly woman approached and asked him if he could come by her house and have a look. I was curious, so I followed her home, said Mr Goh, 47, who was working as a financial planner at the time. That encounter 13 years ago would change the course of his life in ways he could not imagine. He found the womans place overflowing with metal junk. She had once made a living as a karung guni, collecting scrap to sell, but age and illness had caught up with her and she could no longer manage the hoard alone. I told her I could find some volunteers to help. And things started rolling from there, he said. That evening, he reached out to his friends, but was turned down by all of them. Undeterred, he put up a post on Facebook. Four strangers responded, and together they cleared the old womans home. Profoundly affected by the difference they were able to make, Mr Goh founded the charity Helping Joy soon after in 2012 and invited his four new friends to volunteer their time and services to help other old people in similar situations. Today, one of them works full time at the charity as a centre manager. Another, who currently works in delivery, still volunteers with Helping Joy. The remaining two stopped volunteering in 2014 due to their family and work commitments. Helping Joy took off soon after it was set up. As more and more homes were referred to it by social workers, grassroots leaders and several care facilities, Mr Goh found it difficult to juggle his work and the cause to which he had committed. In 2016, he quit his job and focused his attention on the charity. Mr Goh is a finalist for The Straits Times Singaporean of the Year award, which isgiven to a Singaporean or group of citizens who have made a significant contribution to society. This can be through achievements that put Singapore on the world stage, or by going beyond the call of duty to selflessly improve the lives of others in the community, among other ways. Now in its 11th year, the award isorganised by The Straits Times and presented by UBS Singapore. Leaving his job meant giving up financial security, but Mr Goh felt he needed to work for a cause greater than himself. He has been divorced since 2014 and has a 14-year-old-son. He said the salary he earns as the co-founder of Helping Joy is comparable with that of an executive manager. Though a far cry from what he earned as a financial planner, he is satisfied with it. As long as I am able to self-sustain, I dont need to live in luxury. At least I learn things that others dont have the chance to learn, and I am able to make friends, he said. A single decluttering session can take six to eight hours. Apart from the time taken to get to know the beneficiaries and understand their living conditions days earlier, Mr Goh and his team have to map out how many volunteers they require to get the house cleared out in a day. They will also need to raise sufficient donations – $3,000 to $5,000 – to replace faulty electrical equipment and broken furniture. Handymen and painters will also have to be called in to make the house suitable for living. Also, when items are removed from a home, they cannot just be tossed into a bin. We need to open up every little trash bag with cockroaches, and sort it out. Even those with bedbugs or filled with dust, said Mr Goh, adding that items that are serviceable need to be shown to the residents to receive permission to discard them. Every item is valuable to the beneficiary. It might seem not valuable to us, but it might be something memorable to them, he said. One such beneficiary is Mr Lee Han Tiong, 76, whose home in Boon Lay was cleaned by the charity in 2025. Divorced with one son, Mr Lee had been living with his mother until her death three years ago at the age of 98. Over the years, the flat became increasingly cluttered as his mother kept old magazines and household items. For more than a decade, Mr Lee also struggled with a worsening bedbug infestation, leaving him with frequent bites.Mobility issues made him reliant on an electric scooter, but even that became infested, forcing him to discard its cushion. There were too many bedbugs, it was very scary. I had no choice but to throw my things away, he said. Mr Goh and his team first visited Mr Lees home in late 2025 to declutter the flat and remove infested items. They will be returninglater in January for further treatment. The charity also provided Mr Lee with essential items, including a refrigerator, washing machine and clothes. Expressing his gratitude to the team of about 40 Helping Joy volunteers that transformed his home, he said: I was very happy to see them clean my house. Mr Goh does not just stand aside to supervise, he gets involved in any way he can. Be it washing toilets, battling an infestation of cockroaches, removing faeces and bottled urine from a home, or even hauling bulky items to the ground floor. Hoarding, as Mr Goh has learnt, is a habit shaped by trauma, fear and loss. Helping Joy teams go back to households they have decluttered for cleaning and check-ins, slowly building trust. We show our love and care because once they find that there is someone to rely on, eventually they will part with things they hoard... Something new takes its place, which is our love and care, he said. After a house is cleaned, Mr Goh and his team continue to support beneficiaries through the final stage of their lives. This includes providing funeral services for those with no family. We cannot just say when they die, its not our problem. Thats the last journey of their life, and we want to ensure that we take care of them all the way until the end, said Mr Goh. Be it a simple wake or a religious rite, Helping Joy fulfils these requests, even collecting bodies from hospitals when there is no next of kin to do so. It is like a proper farewell, and closing the chapter with those we have helped,said Mr Goh. Since 2012, Helping Joy has decluttered over 300 homes and provided support to more than 800 elderly people. Its operations are funded solely through donations. When they fall short, at times Mr Goh and his team have to spend their own money. The charity now employs seven staff, and has amassed a pool of about 200 committed volunteers. We are blessed that we have this group of volunteers that has been with us for many, many years. We would not be able to do what we do without our volunteers and donors. It is teamwork, Mr Goh said. Through his many experiences decluttering homes, Mr Goh believes hoarding is a growing problem in Singapore, especially with an ageing population. I cant stop… If I do, who is going to continue to take care of them? he said. The best part of my job is when beneficiaries thank me from their heart because that is something that money cannot buy.

"No risk factors, no symptoms: How early lung cancer was discovered in a non-smoker","Jan 12, 2026, 04:05 AM",,https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/3b1906a36b3dae6953e5f3a196f66b02e9ded2fcdb62be28d4198510254fa99b,"A low-dose CT scan can detect lung nodules as small as 4mm to 5mm, enabling early intervention when treatment is most effective.PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES","['Cancer', 'Branded content']","John (not his real name) is a model of healthy living. The former general counsel regularly plays sports and also ensures he eats a balanced diet. He also has never smoked in his life, with no family history of lung disease.An X-ray ordered during a routine health screening in Oct 2024 revealed an unexpected shadow. Says the 60-year-old: The X-ray revealed a dark spot in the right cavity of my chest, and the doctor advised me to follow up with a low-dose CT (computed tomography) scan for further investigations. The patient was referred to Dr Su Jang Wen, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Gleneagles Hospital, who confirmed the presence of a 2cm tumour at the upper part (lobe) of his right lung. It took a while for the news to sink in, recalls John. After consulting with Dr Su, John underwent a single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The tumour was first extracted through a 2.5cm incision, and an on-site pathologist immediately tested the tissue, confirming it was cancerous. The surgical team then removed the entire upper lobe – one-third of Johns right lung – along with the lymph nodes on the right side of his chest to ensure all cancerous tissue was excised. Following the surgery, John was discharged within a week, and he was able to resume his daily activities within a month. Every year, almost 2 million people worldwide die from lung cancer. While it may not be the most common cancer, it is theleading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, says Dr Su. He also observes that there has been an increasing number of lung cancer diagnoses in non-smokers, particularly in Asia. Environmental factors, genetic predisposition, air pollution and second-hand smoke exposure can all contribute to the development of lung cancer. However, there is a significant group of patients with no risk factors found, such as in Johns case, says Dr Su. Adds Dr Chin Tan Min, a medical oncologist at Gleneagles Hospital: Although smoking is a definite risk factor for lung cancer, it has been increasingly recognised that lung cancer can occur in non-smokers. A local study of two groups of lung cancer patients1found that the proportion of never-smokers diagnosed with lung cancer increased from 31 per cent in the 1999-2002 cohort to 48 per cent in the 2008-2011 group. According to theSingapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2022, over 9,200 cases of lung cancer were diagnosed between 2018 and 2022, making it the third most common cancer among both men and women. Nipping this cancer in the bud is critical. The survival rate drops by 30 to 40 per cent between Stages 1 and 2, says Dr Su, explaining: While Stage 1 lung cancer has a five-year survival rate of at least 65 per cent, the early form (Stage 1A1) can be cured in more than 92 per cent of cases, according to the American Cancer Society. In contrast, survival rates for Stage 4 disease remain in the single digits despite medical advances. In Johns case, his Stage 1 lung cancer offered the best prognosis, as the tumour was still small and had not spread to lymph nodes or other organs, notes Dr Su. Dr Chin adds: Depending on the size of the nodule, generally, suspicious-looking nodules that are of a significant size will need to be biopsied to rule out cancer. For very small nodules that are less than a centimetre, doctors may choose to monitor them over time with regular check-ups. This can be a grey area, and the healthcare team should make this decision together with each patient based on their specific situation. She continues: If cancer is found, the treatment depends on how advanced it is. Early-stage cancer might be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. More advanced cases may need a combination of treatments, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted treatment to treat the cancer. The goal is to give patients the best chance of full recovery. Dr Su says that early identification of potential malignant tumours and taking definitive action at the earliest possible timing are important. In his practice, he has been removing lesions less than 1cm when clinically appropriate, to help clarify the diagnosis and guide subsequent care should the lesion turn out to be cancerous. However, one of the key challenges with lung cancer is that it often develops silently, prompting the need for screening of those at high risk to facilitate early detection. Symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, or breathlessness typically emerge only in more advanced stages, notes Dr Su. According to Dr Su Jang Wen, cardiothoracic surgeon at Gleneagles Hospital: Coughing out blood to depict lung cancer as seen in television shows is not the usual presentation of lung cancer. Contrary to popular belief, most patients who undergo lung cancer treatment do not go bald. You can continue your fitness goals: Through structured exercise and physiotherapy programmes, the initial lung function loss after surgery can be much improved or recovered. A low-dose CT scan, which provides detailed cross-sectional images of the lungs, uses only about 20 per cent of the radiation dose of a standard chest CT while still producing clear images, he explains. He adds: It is sensitive and capable of detecting nodules as small as 4mm or 5mm – sometimes even smaller – making it far more effective than a standard chest X-ray. In early 2026, Gleneagles Hospital will offer an ultra low-dose CT option for eligible high-risk patients within clinical screening guidelines. Ultra low-dose CT lung screening has been shown to detect lung cancer more effectively than chest X-ray, says Dr John Wan Mun Chin, a diagnostic and interventional radiologist at Gleneagles Hospital. The radiation exposure is comparable to natural background radiation over a short period of time, or roughly one round-trip flight between Tokyo and New York. The scan is fast and painless, does not require any injection, and image interpretation is supported by Health Sciences Authority-approved AI software as part of the clinical assessment process. Currently, guidelines byAcademy of Medicine Singaporerecommend lung cancer screening for individuals aged 50 to 80 years, with a smoking history of 20 or more packs a year, in current smokers, or those who had quit smoking less than or equal to 15 years ago. Dr Chin notes that researchers both globally and locally are studying whether lung cancer screening should be extended to non-smokers in Asia, particularly those with a strong family history of cancers. Mature results are not definitive at the moment, and as such, there is currently no standardised lung cancer screening programme for non-smokers in Singapore. Check your eligibility and speak to your doctor about low-dose CT screening if you are 50 to 80 years old with a ≥20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke, or have quit smoking within the last 15 years.Find out more about lung cancer screening here.

Different professions come with different demands, and not everyone around the table understands what the other does. In Ms Joyce Ers family, that barrier does not exist. With three other nurses in the household – her younger sister, younger brother and his wife – conversations are grounded in a shared understanding of care and service. Ms Er, now 48, is the eldest and the first among her siblings to enter the profession. Over time, others followed suit and nursing became a shared point of reference rather than something that needed explaining. Watch this video to find out more about what Ms Er does. Today, she is a nursing lead for education and training at NUHS@Home – a service that provides hospital-level care in patients homes – and an Advanced Practice Nurse at Alexandra Hospital. Over 26 years in the profession, her career has taken her across acute hospital settings, specialised oncology services and, more recently, into shaping how care can be delivered safely beyond hospital walls. She shares more about her journey and how the profession has evolved. I started my nursing career in 1999 after completing my diploma in nursing at Nanyang Polytechnic. At the time, I was deciding between becoming a nurse and a teacher. There was strong demand for nurses then, and conversations with my parents helped affirm my decision. My early years were spent at KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, where I rotated through obstetrics and gynaecology, as well as paediatric medical, surgical and intensive care units (ICU). One defining period was during the SARS outbreak in 2003. I was deployed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital to help set up a temporary paediatric ICU to care for children suspected of having SARS. That experience deepened my understanding of the responsibility nurses carry and reaffirmed my commitment to the profession. But it also made me realise that I wanted to do more beyond paediatrics. I later spent time in Australia, where I completed my Bachelor of Nursing at the University of Sydney in 2005. While studying, I worked part-time as a registered nurse at Royal North Shore Hospital. In 2006, I joined the National University Hospitals Cancer Centre and later became part of the gynaecological oncology team, where I helped initiate and expand womens cancer services. This included surgical care, clinical trials, survivorship programmes and cancer genetic counselling. I was also involved in organising patient support groups and training primary care nurses in cervical cancer screening. Then, I moved to Alexandra Hospital in 2019, where I continue to work in acute general medicine while leading nursing research and evidence-based practice. In 2023, I took on an additional role at NUHS@Home, expanding my portfolio to include the development of nursing services, education and training for home-based acute care. I am also pursuing a Doctor of Nursing Practice to strengthen my ability to lead and influence nursing practice at a systems level. What has stayed with me over the years is the human connection. I cannot think of a day in nursing where there is no human touch involved, and that is what continues to bring me joy. Knowing that I am needed by others is what motivates me every day. My role at NUHS@Home is more focused on training and education as well as service development. I help to bring hospital care into homes. Earlier in my career, patients would sometimes ask if care could be extended into their homes, but that was not possible then. Nursing was largely confined to hospital settings. As the healthcare landscape evolved, programmes such as NUHS@Home now allow nurses to provide more continuous and holistic support to patients beyond the hospital. Because many nursing skills have traditionally been hospital-based, a key part of my work involves developing training programmes to prepare nurses for this home-based model. I work closely with nurses to understand their challenges, identify learning gaps and ensure care is aligned with best practice, supported by technology where appropriate. In 2022, I worked with a group of nurses at Alexandra Hospital to simplify nursing documentation. We reviewed both clinical and non-clinical forms, removed duplication and digitised processes where possible. The number of forms was reduced by almost half and it helped improve efficiency. This approach has since been adopted across other NUHS institutions. At NUHS@Home, we introduced Entrustable Professional Activities, a framework used to assess how ready newly joined nurses are to carry out specific tasks independently in home-based settings. We also implemented emergency simulation training to strengthen nurses ability to recognise and respond to clinical emergencies during home visits. These initiatives show that nurses can play a leading role in improving systems and processes. Agility, critical thinking and the courage to step into new roles are increasingly important in nursing today. Healthcare is constantly evolving, so nurses need to adapt to new care models, technologies and patient needs. Critical thinking is just as essential, as patient care today is more complex, and nurses are expected to assess situations, make sound clinical judgments and work closely with other healthcare professionals to shape care plans. Courage also matters – the courage to take on responsibilities that may not have existed a decade ago, and to keep learning and growing. A career in nursing does not always follow a straight path, but there are now structured pathways across clinical practice, education, research, management, innovation and informatics, as well as hybrid roles that combine these areas. My advice is to approach nursing with openness and a willingness to keep learning. It is a profession that offers growth, purpose and the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on patients and communities.

REUTERS/Adam Gray/File Photo","['China', 'Venezuela', 'Donald Trump']","WASHINGTON, Jan 11 - Among the many goals of last weeks U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was to send China a message: stay away from the Americas. For at least two decades, Beijing has sought to build influence in Latin America, not only to pursue economic opportunities but to gain a strategic foothold on the doorstep of its top geopolitical rival. Chinas progress - from satellite tracking stations in Argentina and a port in Peru to economic support for Venezuela - has been an irritant for successive U.S. administrations, including that of Donald Trump. Several Trump administration officials told Reuters the U.S. presidents move against Maduro was intended in part to counter Chinas ambitions, and Beijings days of leveraging debt to get cheap oil from Venezuela were over. WE DONT WANT YOU THERE Trump made the message explicit on Friday, expressing discomfort with China and Russia as a next-door neighbor, in a meeting with oil executives. I told China and I told Russia, We get along with you very well, we like you very much, we dont want you there, youre not gonna be there, Trump said. Now, he said, he will tell China that we are open for business and that they can buy all the oil they want from us there or in the United States. The success of the January 3 early morning raid, in which U.S. commandos swept into Caracas and grabbed the Venezuelan president and his wife, was a blow to Chinas interests and prestige. The air defenses that U.S. forces quickly disabled had been supplied by China and Russia, and Trump said 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil under sanctions, much of it previously bound for Chinese ports, will now be sent to the U.S. Analysts say Maduros capture exposed Beijings limited ability to exert its will in the Americas. The attack exposed the gulf between Chinas great-power rhetoric and its real reach in the Western Hemisphere, said Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. Beijing can protest diplomatically, but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure, he said. In a statement to Reuters, the Chinese embassy in Washington said it rejected what it called the United States unilateral, illegal, and bullying acts. China and Latin American and Caribbean countries maintain friendly exchanges and cooperation. No matter how the situation may evolve, we will continue to be a friend and partner, said Liu Pengyu, the embassys spokesperson. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. But one administration official said China should be concerned about their position in the Western Hemisphere, adding that their partners in the region increasingly realize China cannot protect them. TRUMPS UNCLEAR CHINA POLICY The Trump administrations policy toward Beijing appears contradictory, with concessions aimed at calming a trade war on one hand and more assertive U.S. support for Taiwan on the other. The Venezuela operation appeared to tilt U.S. policy in a more hawkish direction. Indeed, the timing of the U.S. attack amplified Beijings embarrassment. Just hours before being toppled, Maduro met Chinas special envoy for Latin America, Qiu Xiaoqi, in Caracas, his last public appearance before becoming a U.S. captive. The meeting, staged on camera even as U.S. military forces were secretly poised to launch their operation, suggested Beijing was blindsided, said another U.S. official. If they knew, they wouldnt have gone so publicly, the U.S. official told Reuters. For years, Beijing poured money into Venezuelas oil refineries and infrastructure, providing an economic lifeline after the U.S. and its allies tightened sanctions from 2017. Along with Russia, China has also provided funding and equipment for Venezuelas military, including radar arrays recently billed as able to detect advanced U.S. military aircraft. Those systems did little to impede a raid U.S. officials boasted had been conducted without any losses. Any nation around the world with Chinese defense equipment is checking their air defenses and wondering how safe they actually are from the United States, said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank. They are also noticing how Chinas diplomatic assurances to Iran and Venezuela resulted in zero meaningful protection when the U.S. military arrived. China is now studying what went wrong with those defenses so they can shore up their own systems, according to a person briefed on intelligence about their response. CHINA FACES OTHER REGIONAL RISKS China may soon be under pressure elsewhere in the region. It has sought to increase its influence in Cuba, and the U.S. suspects Beijing runs an intelligence-gathering operation there. China denies this, but last year pledged better intelligence sharing with Cuba. In the days after the Venezuela operation, Trump said U.S. military intervention in Cuba, which has suffered from the loss of Venezuelan oil, was likely unnecessary because it appeared ready to fall on its own. The Trump administration also continues to push Chinese companies away from port operations around the Panama Canal, the critical waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. A State Department official said the U.S. remains concerned about Chinese influence near the canal, but appreciates Panamas actions to curb this, including by exiting Beijings Belt and Road Initiative and auditing the Panama ports concession under contract to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. While China may be on the back foot in the region, analysts caution that extended U.S. military involvement in Venezuela or deterioration in the security situation there could open a door for Beijing to reassert itself. Daniel Russel, a former senior State Department official now with the Asia Society, said the dramatic shift in Washington under Trump from a rule-of-law posture to a spheres-of-influence logic focused on the Western Hemisphere could play into Chinas hands. Beijing wants Washington to accept that Asia is in Chinas sphere, and no doubt hopes that the U.S. will get bogged down in Venezuela, he said.

Lai wasfound guilty on two counts of conspiracy to commit collusionin December under a sweeping national security law that was imposed by Beijing in 2020 after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in the Chinese finance hub a year earlier. The 78-year-old media mogul was also convicted of publishing seditious articles through his now-closed Apple Daily newspaper. Lai is a British citizen and the UK government has condemned his politically motivated prosecution in an earlier statement calling for his release. US President Donald Trump also said he hadasked Chinese leader Xi Jinping to consider releasing Lai. Lawyers will address three High Court judges on how to punish Lai starting from 10am, with arguments scheduled to last four days. The court has yet to announce a date for Lais sentencing. The rags-to-riches tycoon can appeal. The judges wrote in their 856-page verdict that Lai harboured his resentment and hatred of (China) for many of his adult years and sought the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party. Hong Kongs national security law states that collusion offences of a grave nature will result in a prison term of between 10 years and life. The colonial-era crime of sedition carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail. Around 40 people were seen queueing outside the West Kowloon law court building over the weekend, with some telling AFP they hoped to get a seat in the public gallery to support Lai. Judges are also expected to hear sentencing arguments on Jan 12 related to eight other people – including six Apple Daily executives – who had pleaded guilty as part of the same case. Lai has been behind bars since 2020, and authorities say he has been kept in solitary confinement at his own request. Two of Lais children, Sebastien and Claire,warned in recent monthsthat their diabetic father had lost a very significant amount of weight and showed signs of nail and tooth decay. The Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied those claims, insisting that Lai received adequate and comprehensive care while in custody. Amnesty International said last month that Lais conviction feels like the death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong, while the Committee to Protect Journalists called it a sham. A government spokesperson said in December that Lais case has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press at all and that he was using journalism as a front to commit crimes. Hong Kong had arrested 385 people for various national security crimes and convicted 175 of them as of Jan 1, according to official figures. Police made nearly 70 national security-related arrests in 2025, more than double the figure from 2024.

The party, backed largely by young and urban voters, unveiled 12 key agendas on Jan 11, including bureaucratic and regulatory overhaul aimed at stamping out corruption, infrastructure development, and restructuring law enforcement and the justice system. The Peoples Party is also seeking to galvanise Thailands lacklustre economic performance by pivoting towards manufacturing components for technologies like semiconductors as well as revitalising legacy industries. It also identified agriculture, medical and space industries to help restore Thailands status as a regional tiger after years of the slowest growth among South-east Asias largest economies. If Thailand fails to recover within the next five years, the Fifth Tiger will permanently fade into folklore, Mr Veerayooth Kanchoochat, one of the partys candidates for prime minister, told supporters at a campaign event. He added that there is a narrow window for Thailand to reclaim that status, with no sector having been able to create growth momentum for the country since the success of the local auto industry. The party also seeks to plug black holes in the economy within its first 100 days in office to boost competitiveness. It said the prevalence of counterfeit goods, foreign price-dumping, and illegal foreign competition in protected industries has resulted in losses of one trillion baht (S$41 billion) to the nations US$500 billion (S$644 billion) economy each year. To mobilise supporters, the party is seeking to build on its predecessors electoral successes by positioning itself as the agent of change in Thai politics, which has been dominated by a power struggle between the parties backed by billionaire populist ex-leader Thaksin Shinawatra and the military-royalist establishment that opposes him. The Peoples Party represents a major threat for the two camps, after its predecessor, Move Forward, won the last election in 2023. Move Forward was blocked from power and then dissolved in 2024 by the Constitutional Court for trying to amend Thailands royal defamation law – a ruling that bars the newer party from campaigning on that issue. While the Peoples Party is widely tipped to again be the biggest winner in the Feb 8 vote, it remains unclear whether it will be able to form a coalition government with any of the other leading parties. Its reformist agenda has been criticised by opponents as too aggressive or disrespectful of traditional Thai values and institutions. Still, party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawutmaintained his lead as the most preferred candidatein the general election, according to the latest opinion poll, ahead of incumbent Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul. We have the political will. We have the right team and the right people, the policies and the plans ready for immediate action, Mr Natthaphong told supporters in capital Bangkok, the partys electoral stronghold.

Support for Mr Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, leader of the Peoples Party, rose to 24.76 per cent from 17.2 per cent in December 2025, a Jan 5 to 8 survey by the National Institute of Development Administration showed. Incumbent Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul of the conservative Bhumjaithai Party followed, with the backing of 20.84 per cent of respondents, up from 12.32 per cent. The percentage of respondents who are indecisive about which candidate to support has shrunk from 40.6 per cent in December 2025 to 14.12 per cent. Support increased for most of the candidates as voter interest increasescloser to the Feb 8 election. The Democrat Partys Mr Abhisit Vejjajiva, a former prime minister, had the third-highest support, with 12.12 per cent. Mr Yodchanan Wongsawat, nephew of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra and thelatest family member to front the Pheu Thai Party campaign, had the backing of 9.64 per cent of respondents. Mr Anutin, who has only been in power for four months,dissolved Parliamentin Decemberto prevent his minority government from being toppled in a no-confidence vote threatened by Mr Natthaphongs party, triggering the snap election. The Peoples Party is the successor to a previous political grouping that won the 2023 general election, only to be blocked from power and later dissolved over its campaign to amend Thailands royal defamation law. Mr Anutins Bhumjaithai Party trails the Peoples Party, which led the latest survey with the backing of about 30 per cent of respondents, even though Bhumjaithai held the incumbency advantage heading into the polls. The ruling party did narrow the gap, receiving about 22 per cent of support – more than double what it got in December 2025. Pheu Thai was the choice of around 15 per cent of respondents and the Democrat Party won the backing of 12 per cent. The top parties will seek to win with large enough margins in the upcoming election to lead what looks set to be a coalition government and end a sequence of short-lived administrations since the last election in 2023. The survey reflected the opinions of 2,500 Thais aged 18 and above across the nation, according to the institute.

The recovery of a body on Jan 11 brought the confirmed death toll to seven, with at least 29 people still missing as the crucial 72-hour window since the landslide in Cebu City came to an end. About 50 sanitation workers were buried on Jan 8 when the mountain of garbage toppled onto them from an estimated height of 20 storeys at the Binaliw Landfill, a privately operated facility that handles refuse for the city of nearly one million. Yesterday, we detected two signs of life through our specialised radar. There were still heartbeats 30m below the debris, but right now, there are no reports of that anymore, local fire officer Wendell Villanueva told AFP on Jan 11. He said it was unlikely for people to still be alive three days after tons of debris and trash had collapsed over them. So far 12 employees have been pulled alive from the garbage and hospitalised. On Jan 10, a rescue official said emergency workers had faced the danger of further collapse by the still-shifting mountain of refuse, forcing pauses in their efforts. Rain had only increased that danger, Mr Villanueva said. In a phone call with AFP, Mr Villanueva said the focus was expected to turn from rescue to recovery on Jan 12, later adding that the final decision would be up to an inter-agency team. A public information officer separately said the focus was likely to shift to recovering bodies. Outside the disaster site, dozens of family members huddled under tents provided to shield them from the sun, while others found spots nearer the facility to watch the rescue efforts. What we want now is to find them. Alive or dead – so we can properly take care of them, said Ms Jezille Matabid, whose brother Junelle, a welder at the site, was among the missing. Another woman, who declined to give her name, said the lack of information about her older sister, a landfill employee, had been agonising. We feel like were going crazy here just waiting for an update. Shes three months pregnant, she said. Mr Elmer Aguilar, whose brother Larry, a welder, was among the missing, said he had come with 10 others hoping to aid in the search effort, only to be turned away. We went here because we thought we could help dig, but when we arrived, the guards did not allow us to enter. Mr Joel Garganera, a Cebu City council member, described the height from which the trash fell as alarming, estimating the top of the pile had stood 20 storeys above the area struck. Images released by police showed a massive mound of trash atop a hill directly behind buildings that officials told AFP contained administrative offices and housing for employees. In an interview with local media, Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival pointed to a recent earthquake and typhoon-driven rains as potential precipitating circumstances. But Mr Garganera said the mountain of garbage had been an obvious danger. Every now and then, when it rains, there are landslides happening around the city, with a landfill or a mountain that is made of garbage posing a particular danger, Mr Garganera said. The garbage is like a sponge, it really absorbs water. It doesnt (take) a rocket scientist to say that eventually, the incident will happen. He said the disaster was a double whammy for the city, noting that the facility was the lone service provider for Cebu and adjacent communities. According to the website of operator Prime Integrated Waste Solutions, the landfill processed 1,000 tons of municipal solid waste daily. Calls to the company went unanswered on Jan 11.

At least 76 people were killed during the demonstrations in September 2025, which saw four-time prime minister K.P. Sharma Oli ousted andreplaced by former chief justice Sushila Karkiin an interim capacity until an election scheduled later in 2026. Mr Shah, who was deposed in 2008 at the end of a decade-long civil war, has largely refrained from commenting on Nepals fractious politics. But in a 12-minute video address on Jan 10 to mark National Unity Day, he warned that Nepal itself might not survive any more. Nearly two decades since we left the palace, the crisis the country continues to face has us worried, he said, with a picture of the late king Prithvi Narayan Shah – the first to rule a united Nepal – visible in the background. Yesterday, there was a concern that there was no development in the country, but today there is a bigger worry that the country itself might not survive any more, he added. Mr Shah criticised leaders for failing to heed the needs of young people, saying that this had bred dissatisfaction among the youth. Seeking solutions without national consensus is merely wasting time. Let us all unite and move forward in the journey of prosperity, he said. Mr Shah was crowned in 2001 after his elder brother, then King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah, and his family were killed in a palace massacre. In 2005, Mr Shah suspended the Constitution and dissolved Parliament, triggering a democratic uprising in which a Maoist insurgency sided with Nepals political establishment to orchestrate huge street protests. That eventually precipitated the end of the conflict, with Parliament voting in 2008 to abolish Nepals 240-year-old Hindu monarchy. Public support for restoration of the monarchy has grown in tandem with dissatisfaction over political instability, corruption and slow economic development. Last May, thousands of royalists marched in the capital Kathmandu demanding the restoration of the monarchy, but leaders of major political parties said it was just a daydream. On Jan 11, royalists marked the anniversary of King Prithvi Narayan Shahs birth in front of Kathmandus main administrative hub. We will have no country if there is no king, said farmer Dhurba Raj Giri, 70. Without a king as our guardian, the country is in this trouble.

In its latest warning, the BMA said levels of PM2.5 fine particulate matter are expected to rise in Bangkok from Jan 9 to 17 due to low ventilation rates, as forecast by the Meteorological Department. The BMA estimated PM2.5 would remain at a moderate-risk level from Jan 9 to 11, when vulnerable groups should reduce time outdoors and wear air-filtering masks when outside. The BMA saidthe air quality levelis expected to turn red (high risk) from Jan 12 to 15 as ventilation rates remain low, leading to a build-up of PM2.5 in several districts, especially at night. It said ventilation should begin to improve on Jan 16 and 17, but accumulated PM2.5 is expected to keep air quality at an orange level. To cope with the new round of poor air quality, the BMA said it would announce a low-emission zone covering all 50 districts to restrict large trucks from entering the capital. The BMA said it would also step up engine inspections and enforce the 20 per cent smoke opacity limit for vehicles, especially trucks, buses and vehicles entering or leaving construction zones. Bangkok residents were advised to monitor forecasts on the AirBKK app so they can prepare for worsening air quality. The BMA said the proposed two-day work-from-home period would reduce travel and vehicle exhaust emissions during the expected pollution peak.

According to data released by the Korea Customs Service, annual ramyeon exports reached a new all-time high of US$1.52 billion in 2025, up 21.8 per cent from 2024. The milestone caps a rapid ascent, as exports have doubled from US$765 million in 2022 and grown seven times over the past decade from US$219 million in 2015. Since 2021, the figures have increased at an average annual rate of about 23 per cent. China and the US together account for more than 40 per cent of South Koreas ramyeon exports. Shipments to China rose 47.9 per cent on year to US$385 million, or 25.3 per cent of the total, while exports to the US amounted to US$255 million, or 16.7 per cent. Exports to the US grew at an average annual rate of 68 per cent from 2022 to 2024, but a 15 per cent tariff appears to have weighed on growth in 2025, when shipments rose 18.1 per cent, below the overall export growth rate. As ramyeon has become a growing export item, the countrys leading noodle makers have begun expanding overseas. Nongshim launched co-branded products tied tothe Netflix film KPop Demon Huntersin the US and is ramping up its export capacity through a new export-only factory in Busan in 2026. Samyang Foods completed its second factory in Miryang, South Gyeongsang province, in 2025 and is constructing its first overseas plant in China.

India proposes forcing smartphone makers to give source code in security overhaul,"Jan 11, 2026, 05:28 PM","Jan 11, 2026, 07:01 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f7a2fc371c742c62223fb5da6e8373aaa618fa93daedad546b82eeaf047b5adf,The cyber safety application Sanchar Saathi is seen on the screen of a smartphone in New Delhi.PHOTO: AFP,"['India', 'Smartphones', 'Cyber security']","NEW DELHI- India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures,prompting behind-the-scenes oppositionfrom giants like Apple and Samsung. The technology companies have countered thatthe package of 83 security standards, including a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents. The plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the worlds second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones. IT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind, adding that it was premature to read more into it. A spokesperson for the IT ministry said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals. Apple, South Koreas Samsung, Google, Chinas Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian industry group that represents the firms, did not respond to requests for comment. The Indian governments requirements have irked technology firms before. In December, it revoked an order mandating a state-run cybersafety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying in 2025 and required rigorous testing for security cameras over fears of Chinese spying. Xiaomi and Samsung – whose phones use Googles Android operating system – hold 19 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, of Indias market share, while Apple holds 5 per cent, Counterpoint Research estimates. Among the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code – the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly tested at designated Indian laboratories, the documents show. The Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to avoid malicious usage. Industry raised concerns that globally security requirements have not been mandated by any country, said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi. The security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Jan 13 for more discussions, sources said. Smartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined Chinas request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and US law enforcement has also tried and failed to get it. Indias proposals for vulnerability analysis and source code review would require smartphone makers to perform a complete security assessment, after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and analysis. This is not possible... due to secrecy and privacy, MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements. MAIT asked the ministry last week to drop the proposal, a source with direct knowledge said. The Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them. MAITs document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phones battery and seeking government approval for software updates is impractical as they need to be issued promptly.

Iran and its proxies – Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis – threaten not only Israel but also regional stability and international security, a statement from Mr Netanyahus office said. The declaration signed today anchors deep cooperation with Germany in the fields of cyber security, counterterrorism and advanced technologies. Israels enemies should know: our eyes are on them at all times and everywhere, the statement added. The declaration was signed by Mr Netanyahu and visiting German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt. I think Germany and Israel are natural partners. Weve cooperated on the Arrow III, weve cooperated in many areas, Mr Netanyahu said in a separate statement. The initiative formalises a broad security partnership between the security apparatuses of both countries, the statement said. In December 2025, Germany approved a US$3.1 billion (S$4 billion) expansion of a contract for the Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile defence system, which is Israeli-made and developed with US support. The deal, originally signed in 2023, is now worth approximately US$6.5 billion. Israel says it is the countrys largest-ever military export contract. Earlier on Jan 11, Israels Foreign Minister Gideon Saar held talks with Dobrindt, during which he urged the European Union to designate Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. The call came as Iran has been rocked by deadly protests, initially sparked by anger over the rising cost of living but quickly evolving into a broader movement challenging the theocratic government that has ruled the country since the 1979 revolution.

We have to collaborate, work together and show strength and unity, Theo Francken said in a phone interview, adding that there is a need for a NATO operation in the high north. Trump said on Friday that the U.S. needs to own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it in the future. European officials have been discussing ways to ease U.S. concerns about security around Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. Francken suggested NATOs Baltic Sentry and Eastern Sentry operations, which combine forces from different countries with drones, sensors and other technology to monitor land and sea, as possible models for an Arctic Sentry. He acknowledged Greenlands strategic importance but said I think that we need to sort this out like friends and allies, like we always do. A NATO spokesperson said on Friday that alliance chief Mark Rutte spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the importance of the Arctic for shared security and how NATO is working to enhance its capabilities in the high north. Denmark and Greenlands leaders have said that the Arctic island could not be annexed and international security did not justify such a move.

REUTERS/Tom Brenner","['Iran', 'United States', 'Protests']","Jan 11 - Some U.S. lawmakers in both major parties on Sunday questioned whether military action against Iran is the best approach for the United States as Iranian authorities face growing turmoil. U.S. President Donald Trump in recent days has left open the possibility of American intervention in Iran, where the biggest anti-government protests in years have led to the Revolutionary Guards blaming unrest on terrorists and vowing to safeguard the governing system. But at least two U.S. senators sounded notes of caution during interviews on TV networks Sunday morning programs. I dont know that bombing Iran will have the effect that is intended, Republican Senator Rand Paul said on ABC News This Week show. Rather than undermining the regime, a military attack on Iran could rally the people against an outside enemy, Paul and Democratic Senator Mark Warner said. Warner, appearing on Fox News Sunday, warned that a military strike against Iran could risk uniting Iranians against the United States in a way that the regime has not been able to. History shows the dangers of U.S. intervention, said Warner, who argued that the U.S.-backed 1953 overthrow of Irans government set in motion a chain of events that gradually led to the rise of the countrys Islamic regime in the late 1970s. The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported that U.S. military and diplomatic officials will brief Trump on Tuesday about options for Iran, including cyberattacks and potential military action. Iran has said it will target U.S. military bases if the United States launches an attack. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has often touted a muscular approach to foreign policy, said Trump needs to embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the [Iranian] regime. If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people, Graham said on Fox News Sunday Morning Futures show. Youve got to end this. Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of the Iranian shah who was ousted in 1979, said on Sunday he is prepared to return to Iran to lead a shift to a democratic government. Im already planning on that, Pahlavi said on Sunday Morning Futures. My job is to lead this transition to make sure that no stone is left unturned, that in full transparency, people have an opportunity to elect their leaders freely and to decide their own future.

The Telegraph reported on Jan 10 that military chiefs from Britain and other European countries were drawing up plans for a possible NATO mission in Greenland, which US President Donald Trump hasrepeatedly said he wanted to acquire. The newspaper said British officials had begun early-stage talks with Germany, France and others on plans that could involve deploying British troops, warships and aircraft to protect Greenland from Russia and China. Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the plans, reported separately on Jan 11 that Germany, whose foreign and finance ministers are in Washington on Jan 12, will propose setting up a joint NATO mission to protect the Arctic region. British transport minister Heidi Alexander told Sky News that talks on how to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Arctic were business as usual. Its becoming an increasingly contested geopolitical region, with Russia and China ... you would expect us to be talking to all our allies in NATO about what we can do to deter Russian aggression in the Arctic Circle, Ms Alexander said. Britain was committed to working with NATO allies to strengthen NATOs Arctic deterrence and defence, said a government spokesperson when asked about the Telegraph report. Mr Trump has said the US must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future, arguing US military presence there was not enough. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, who will meet with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Jan 12, said that a solution to US concerns over Russian or Chinese vessels needed to be found within the framework of the NATO alliance. If it comes to questions of territorial sovereignty, we are absolutely clear: The future of Greenland has to be decided by the people of Greenland, said Dr Wadephul on Jan 11. Mr Trump has not provided any evidence to back up his claims of Russian and Chinese vessels operating near Greenland, which Denmark disputes. Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.

The EUgave a long-delayed go-aheadon Jan 9 to the huge trade pact with the South American bloc, overriding opposition led by key power France. Meanwhile, the French Socialist party said it will not vote in favour of two no-confidence motions filed by far-right and far-left opposition parties over Frances failure to block the EUs Mercosur trade deal, giving some breathing space to the countrys fragile government. It would be absurd to censure the government on Mercosur, party leader Olivier Faure told BFM TV on Jan 11. Analysts had said last week that approval chances of these motions were few, especially the one filed by the far-right National Rally (RN), the biggest party in the National Assembly, as left-wing parties never vote for any of its initiatives. Still, the threats underline the political tightrope Mr Macrons administration continues to walk just over a year before the 2027 presidential election, with polls showing the RN has a shot at victory next year. Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu wants neither censure nor dissolution of the National Assembly, Le Parisien newspaper reported on Jan 10. At the same time, his office announced it had asked the Interior Ministry to prepare for possible legislative elections on the same dates as municipal elections, on March 15 and 22, in the event of his governments collapse. Lets be clear. I want neither censure, nor dissolution. My fight is for stability and to ward off disorder, Mr Lecornu told Le Parisien. The motion of no-confidence would send a dramatic signal at a time when we are seeking compromise and an even more dramatic message in view of the international political situation, he told the daily newspaper, after denouncing cynical partisan posturing in a message on X on Jan 9. Mr Lecornu said the no confidence motions sent a negative signal abroad. They will be put to the vote early next week while budget talks are supposed to resume on Jan 13. More than 25 years in the making, supporters see the Mercosur deal as crucial to boost exports, support the continents ailing economy and foster diplomatic ties at a time of global uncertainty. But the agreement has drawn protests from farmers who fear being undercut by an influx of cheap beef and other products from South America. Argentinas Foreign Minister Pablo Quirno had already announced that the deal would be signed on Jan 17. Paraguay is the country currently holding the rotating presidency of Mercosur.

Speaking to reporters, she said the peace plan was the 20-point proposal that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed with U.S. President Donald Trump at the end of last year. She added that, alongside the plan, there were substantial, robust, and well-defined security guarantees for Kyiv from the United States and Europe. Now, Russia has to show that they are interested in peace, von der Leyen said. She said the security guarantees would rely first on Ukraines armed forces, which she said were well-trained and battle-experienced. It would be the task of the Europeans to make sure the Ukrainian army is also well equipped, she said. The second line of defence would be the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- 35 states including most EU countries as well as Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey. Here it is very good that the Americans are involved, specifically in the verification and the monitoring, but also with a backstop, von der Leyen said. She said that the EU was working on plans to ensure Ukraines economic prosperity after a ceasefire, with ideas to be spelled out in a forthcoming prosperity paper. The document would set out measures for the short-term and over the next decade to boost Ukraines economy and support its recovery.

The officers would be deployed on Jan 11 and Jan 12 to bolster the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol officials already in Minnesota, Ms Noem said on Fox News Sunday Morning Futures programme. Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever. The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal governments deportation push and Jan 7s fatal shooting of 37‑year‑old Renee Good by an ICE officer. Minnesota officials have called the shooting unjustified,pointing to bystander videothey say showed Ms Goods vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired. Ms Noem and other US officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defence because Ms Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the drivers side and told her to get out of the car. In a separate Jan 11 appearance on CNNs State of the Union, Ms Noem said other video footage showed Ms Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Jan 7 morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released. She also accused the Democrats of encouraging violence against immigration officers, reiterating the Trump administrations position that the 37-year-old was a domestic terrorist. Prominent Democratic officials, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have strongly disputed this narrative, saying that footage from the scene shows Ms Goods vehicle turning away from the agent and not posing a threat to his life. These locals, if you look at what Governor Walz has said, if you look at what Mayor Frey has said, theyve extremely politicised and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city, Ms Noem said on CNN. Theyve inflamed the public. Theyve encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that weve seen in Minneapolis the last several days. Since the Jan 7 shooting, thousands of people have demonstrated peacefully in several cities across the country, demanding a full investigation into the circumstances of the deadly encounter. Democratic officials are particularly critical of the fact that local investigators have been excluded from the investigation, which is being conducted by the FBI. It should be a neutral, unbiased investigation where you get the facts, Mr Frey told CNN. He also described as legitimate activists actions to disrupt immigration enforcement operations, such as one in which Ms Good was involved. You need to enforce laws, of course, but theres also a requirement that you carry out laws and carry out enforcement in a constitutional way, Mr Frey added. Weve got pregnant women getting dragged through the street. Weve got high schoolers just getting – American citizens, by the way – getting taken away. Minnesota authorities on Jan 9 said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state investigators. White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on Fox News Sunday that he wanted to let the investigation play out, but that he truly believe[s] that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action.

With the Islamic Republics clerical establishment facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters. According to its latest spreadsheet – from activists inside and outside Iran – US-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 490 protesters and 48 security personnel, with more than 10,600 people arrested. Iran has not given an official toll and Reuters was unable to independently verify the tolls. Mr Trumpwas to be briefed by his officialson Jan 13 on options over Iran including military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources, the Wall Street Journal said on Jan 11. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking in Parliament on Jan 11, warned the United States against a miscalculation. Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target, said Mr Qalibaf, a former commander in Irans elite Revolutionary Guards. The protests began on Dec 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the clerical rulers who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The authorities accuse the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and called for a nationwide rally on Jan 12 to condemn terrorist actions led by the United States and Israel in Iran, state media reported. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Jan 8. Footage posted on social media on Jan 10 from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd has no end nor beginning, a man is heard saying. In footage from the north-eastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Jan 10 showed. Explosions could be heard. Reuters verified the locations. State TV showed dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroners office, saying the dead were victims of events caused by armed terrorists, as well as footage of loved ones gathered outside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran waiting to identify bodies. Authorities on Jan 11 declared three days of national mourning in honour of martyrs killed in resistance against the United States and the Zionist regime, according to state media. Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any US intervention. An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israels military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond with power if need be. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment. Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar. While the Iranian authorities have weathered previous protests, the latest have unfolded with Tehran still recovering from last years war and with its regional positionweakened by blows to allies such as Lebanons Hezbollahsince the Oct 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks against Israel. Irans unrest comes as Mr Trump flexes US muscles on the world stage, having ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and floating the possibility of acquiring Greenland by purchase or military force. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the US were masterminding destabilisation and that Irans enemies had brought in terrorists ... who set mosques on fire .... attack banks, and public properties. Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others, he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems. Iran summoned Britains ambassador on Jan 11 to the foreign ministry in Tehran over interventionist comments attributed to the British foreign minister and a protester removing the Iranian flag from the London Embassy building and replacing it with a style of flag that was used prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Britains foreign office did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Mr Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple Irans ruling establishment. I think it more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker, he told Reuters, noting that Irans ruling elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition. Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests. State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by rioters in Kermanshah in the west. Mr Trump, posting on social media on Jan 10, said: Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!! In a phone call on Jan 10, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed thepossibility of US intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation. Mr Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Irans last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, said Mr Trump had observed Iranians indescribable bravery. Do not abandon the streets, Mr Pahlavi, who is based in the US, wrote on X. Ms Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a Paris-based Iranian opposition group, wrote on X that people in Iran had asserted control of public spaces and reshaped Irans political landscape. Her group, also known as Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK), joined the 1979 revolution but later broke from the ruling clerics and fought them during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Mr Netanyahu, speaking during a Cabinet meeting, said Israel was closely monitoring developments. We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny, he said.

Russia has intensified bombardments of Ukraines energy system since it invaded its neighbour in 2022. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had launched 1,100 drones, more than 890 guided aerial bombs and over 50 missiles, including ballistic, cruise and medium-range weapons, against Ukraine over the past week. On Jan 9, amissile strike on Kyivleft virtually the entire city without power and heating amid a sharp cold snap, and it was not until Jan 11 that authorities restored water supplies and partially restored electricity and heating. Mr Zelensky said Russia deliberately waited for freezing weather to make things worse for the Ukrainian people, and this was a cynical Russian terror specifically against civilians. Moscow made no immediate response. The wars fourth winter could be the coldest and darkest yet, with the accumulated damage to the grid bringing utilities to the brink and temperatures, already below minus 12 deg C, set to plunge to minus 20 deg C later this week. Restoration work is ongoing. However, the energy supply situation in the capital remains very difficult, Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said on Telegram. According to forecasts, the severe frosts are not expected to subside in the coming days. Therefore, the difficult situation in the capital will continue, he added. Ukraines energy ministry said Russian forces had attacked the countrys power system again during the night, briefly cutting off electricity to the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. Not a single day passed this week without attacks on energy facilities and critical infrastructure. A total of 44 attacks were recorded, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram. Ms Svyrydenko said the restoration of heat and electricity supplies was proceeding at a record pace, noting significant improvements in Kyiv would require time but could be reached by Jan 15.

SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) uses industry benchmarks to prevent overcharging of course fees, but we recognise that value is more than a price point. This is why we are tightening our quality checks to look at course duration and curriculum density, ensuring that learners time and public funds are used effectively. Training is also complemented with assessment, to ensure that learners have achieved their learning outcomes. Assessment modes are reviewed by SSG such that they are appropriate to support the learning outcomes the course is intended to deliver. The practice of trainers providing answers to assessments is wrong and contravenes our rules. We have already reached out to Mr Tan to investigate the specific course he attended. To keep learning accessible to learners, SkillsFuture-supported courses receive course-fee subsidies of up to 90 per cent. Remaining course fees are borne by individuals, either through cash or their own SkillsFuture Credit. To ensure learners make the most of this investment, as well as their time and effort, we encourage all learners to look closely at detailed course information and learning outcomes before enrolling to ensure the training aligns with their learning needs and career goals. They can also refer to the Training Quality and Outcomes Measurement (TRAQOM) scores and reviews on MySkillsFuture for insights from past participants. We will continue to enhance the TRAQOM platform to help learners better identify courses that are relevant for them. Learners can also help enrich the learning ecosystem by providing meaningful and honest feedback on their course experience, either via TRAQOM or elsewhere, as Mr Tan did. We remain committed to supporting meaningful skills development while ensuring responsible use of public resources. We welcome feedback on how to enhance the SkillsFuture ecosystem for all Singaporeans.

Forum: Extend proximity housing grants to siblings,"Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Public housing', 'Ministry of National Development', 'Today\'s Letters']","Since its inception in 1960, the Housing Board has played a central role in making home ownership affordable for Singaporeans. Over the decades, housing policies, schemes and grants have evolved in response to changing market conditions, demographic shifts and the socio-economic needs of home owners. These efforts have been widely recognised. In 2008, HDB received the United Nations Public Service Award for its successful public housing and home ownership policies. One such policy is the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG), which encourages families to live with or near their parents by providing financial support for the purchase of resale flats. However, theres a group that appears to have fallen outside the scope of this scheme. Siblings who wish to live near one another for mutual support are not eligible for any similar grant. The same principle underpinning the PHG –kinship, care and mutual support – applies equally to siblings, particularly as Singapores population ages. Letting siblings live in proximity can help them support one another in daily living, health needs and caregiving responsibilities, reducing social isolation and easing pressure on formal care services.

Forum: Create safe spaces for failure to help children build resilience,"Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Education and schools', 'Children and youth']","I refer to Elisha Tusharas Opinion article When adults step back, kids learn to bounce back (Jan 8) for the School for Humans series. Singapores education system is well known for its clear structure, defined pathways and high expectations. While these boundaries provide stability and direction, they may also unintentionally limit opportunities for children to experience failure_an essential ingredient in building resilience as they grow up. In a society where success is often carefully planned and measured, failure can be viewed as something to avoid rather than embrace. Children may learn early on that mistakes carry consequences beyond the lesson itself, shaping their confidence and willingness to take risks. When falling short is stigmatised, children may become more focused on avoiding failure rather than learning from it. Encouraging children to fall or fail does not mean lowering standards or promoting complacency. Instead, it means creating environments where failure is safe, constructive and proportionate. Whether it is managing a poor test result, losing a competition or struggling with a responsibility, these moments teach perseverance, accountability and emotional resilience. Language also matters. When adults frame failure as part of growth rather than a personal shortcoming, children learn to separate effort and outcome from self-worth. Praising persistence, reflection and improvement – rather than just results – sends a powerful message that resilience lies in the process and not in the achievement. Within Singapores well-defined education boundaries, there is room to normalise failure through varied learning experiences. Project-based work, co-curricular activities and community involvement allow children to experiment, make mistakes and adapt in ways that examinations alone may not capture. These experiences mirror real life, where solutions are rarely straightforward and setbacks are inevitable. As children grow up, resilience becomes increasingly vital in navigating uncertainty, relationships and future workplaces. Shielding them from failure may offer short-term comfort, but it risks leaving them ill-equipped for the complexities of adult life. Conversely, learning how to recover from disappointment builds confidence, independence and adaptability.

Together with SGPC, Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) launched the Food Services Productivity Report in October 2025 to help F&B businesses understand their performance relative to industry peers and gain insights on best practices from top-performing operators. To encourage adoption of these best practices, EnterpriseSG rolled out two new initiativesto better support the industry. The FoodX Programme helps F&B businesses to outsource ingredients and labour-intensive food preparation to third-party central kitchens, allowing them to better manage operational and manpower efficiency in their outlets. The Process Optimisation Programme helps F&B businesses to enhance their outlet efficiency through technology adoption, and process and menu redesign. EnterpriseSG also provides financial assistance to F&B companies which are pursuing transformation, internationalisation and digitalisation projects through the Enterprise Development Grant, Market Readiness Assistance Grant and Productivity Solutions Grant respectively. EnterpriseSG and the Infocomm Media Development Authority have also developed the Food Services Industry Digital Plan to assist F&B companies in identifying digitalisation opportunities that align with their business requirements. This plan includes emerging AI-enabled solutions designed to enhance customer experience, optimise operational efficiency, and support sustainable business growth.

(Jan 6) – that rings so true as well. My only grouse with it is that it has come a number of years too late. The implication is that the damage has been done, and it is to the reputation of the Singapore visual arts scene at that. Unlike the writer, I am a big fan of contemporary art. While she dutifully susses out the ins and outs of the Singapore Biennale because of faith in the centrality of art to life, I am in it for the sheer love of it – until I fell out, that is. It was after just a few iterations of the Singapore Biennale that I realised that the vision, curation and organisation as well as the general quality of the artworks left much to be desired. Many of the editions of the Singapore Biennale have been notable for the wrong reasons. Much of the second edition (2011) was held at the Old Kallang Airport, which was not only far from the other venues, but also dingy, dusty and stuffy. This same Biennale saw the censorship of British artist Simon Fujiwaras installation Welcome To The Hotel Munber by the Singapore Art Museum after being shown for two days and without any consultation with the artist. The 2022 edition of the Biennale was bizarrely named Natasha, purportedly to create a sense of familiarity. This concept largely fell flat and is not likely to be repeated here or anywhere. Other than these missteps, I am hard-pressed to recall any venue, theme or artwork from the Singapore Biennale sparking any meaningful conversation. Out of the eight editions, I enjoyed only An Atlas of Mirrors (2016). One out of eight aint bad, you say. But when huge sums of public money are involved, with no or barely any accountability, as there has not been any single artistic director at the helm for two editions, and with generally lacklustre art, and presentation and organisation that dont do anything for Singapores reputation as a visual arts hub, the Singapore Biennale really doesnt have anything going for it. Being held every two or three years notwithstanding, it is time to call it a day for the Singapore Biennale.

The 45-year-olds management team has sued singer-turned-influencer Celia Liang, who has used Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu to accuse Tsai offeaturing Satan-like symbols in her concert. She added that Tsai has the intention of involving her fans in a cult ritual. Liangs controversial video has since beenremoved. According to Taiwan media, Tsais team issued a statement on Jan 7, saying the concert had been falsely interpreted and taken out of context by Liang and some members of the public. They have published and disseminated a large amount of false, misleading information and insulting remarks, which have seriously damaged Jolins reputation and legal rights. This also destroyed a healthy and civilised online environment, the team added. Netizens have identified Tsais accuser as an Australian-Chinese woman who took part in Taiwanesesinging competition One Million Star in 2009. In recent years, she has been active on Chinese social media platforms Douyin and Xiaohongshu as an influencer. Liang responded to the legal statement with a Douyin reel titled Jolin Tsai wants to sue me? on Jan 8. She claimed her comments on the concert were mainly pure entertainment and argued that she was not the first person to interpret the Pleasure World Tour concert that way. She added that she is honoured to be the first person to be sued by Jolin Tsai. However, she warned fans against harassment and online trolling, which are criminal under Chinas laws. She then alluded that she would not rule out producing videos regularly to continue commenting on Tsais works, as a form of counterattack. Tsais Pleasure World Tour kick-started on Dec 30, 2025, at the Taipei Dome.

Leading the Season 2 pack is Son Jong-won, a member of the White Spoon team comprising established chefs. Soft-spoken yet confident, the chef behind Seouls one-Michelin-starred restaurants, Eatanic Garden and LAmant Secret, has captivated viewers. Sons Instagram following has jumped by more than 300,000 since the shows release on Dec 16,2025,reaching 495,000 as at Jan 11. It is said the celebrated chef is South Koreas most followed chef on Instagram. Reservations at his restaurants have become nearly impossible to secure. The 42-year-old has even earned the nickname good-vibe man. South Korean women use the newly emerging term to describe men whose attractiveness is defined by warmth and an overall pleasant and approachable presence. Everything from his taste in fashion – he wears American designer brand Rick Owens, known for its dark, glamorous grunge aesthetic – to his 1.84m height has helped him stand out. He is also the ambassador for luxury Swiss watchmaker Blancpain andScottish whisky brand Johnnie WalkerBlue Label. His resume stands out too. Son earned a civil engineering scholarship at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana, United States. He has worked in some of the worlds best kitchens, honing his craft at Noma in Copenhagen andthree-Michelin-starred San Francisco restaurants Quince, Benu and Coi.He also speaks English fluently. Riding high on his growing popularity, his connections have extended beyond the culinary world, with members of South Koreas conglomerate families publicly noting their ties to him. Hyundai Cardchief executiveand vice-chair Chung Tae-young posted a photo of himself and the chefonInstagram on Jan 7, recalling his visit to Sons Eatanic Garden. I personally dont enjoy omakase and course-style restaurants. But Sons Eatanic Garden, which I visited last winter, was impressive enough to make me want to return. The dishes, paired with alcohol, have a depth of flavour that grabbed my attention, the Instagram post read. Ms Jules Lee, a scion of DL Group, posted a photo of herself and Son on Instagram that same day, with a caption: Eatanic Garden is the best I have ever had. Also enjoying a surge of popularity is Im Seong-geun, a contestant of the show and the winner of Korean Food Battle 3 in 2015. Apart from his performance on the show, Im, 58, has also built a fan base by connecting with audiences through his YouTube channel, Im Seong-geun Im-jjang TV. Having more than 890,000 subscribers, Im has attracted a growing following through his cooking content. Ims rise has been backed by a compelling backstory, rooted in decades of experience in Korean cuisine and personal struggles before Culinary Class Wars 2. His rise is often described as a classic underdog story. After running away from home at a young age, he began his career washing dishes. He defied rigid kitchen hierarchies through relentless practice, working on his knife skills late into the night, eventually becoming a head chef at just 19 – one of the youngest in South Koreas culinary history. Ims culinary career has also taken him into cultural diplomacy. He served as executive banquet chef for the World Association of Chefs Societies in Chile in 2010 and later led state banquet preparations at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing in 2016. One of the breakout figures of Culinary Class Wars 2 is a Black Spoon contestant known as Culinary Monster. Behind the intimidating nickname is Lee Ha-sung, whose culinary style is bold, ambitious and fierce. A former sous chef at The French Laundry in California, Lee, 37, later worked at Atomix in New York, which has two Michelin stars. He was also the first Asian chef to work at Copenhagensthree-Michelin-starred Geranium.

This approach has led many viewers to see him as the ideal competitor in a merit-driven culinary arena.

Acclaimed actors Jung Woo-sung and Lee Jung-jae led the procession, with Jung carrying Ahns portrait and Lee holding the Geumgwan Order of Cultural Merit, the countrys highest cultural honour that was posthumously conferred on the actor. Actors Sul Kyung-gu, Park Chul-min, Yoo Ji-tae, Jo Woo-jin, Park Hae-il and Ju Ji-hoon served as pallbearers. Ahn died on Jan 5surrounded by his family – wife Oh So-young, whom he married in 1985, and two sons, Da-bin and Philip. He was 74. He had been hospitalised since Dec 30 after choking on a piece of food. It was revealed in 2022 that he had been treated for blood cancer since 2019. At the memorial service, Da-bin, 38, read Ahns letter that was written to him in November 1993, when he was five years old, as a farewell note to all who had known and respected his father. Four days ago, I entered my fathers study to organise his belongings and found a letter he had written to me, said Da-bin, representing the family. It feels like a message left for all of us, so I will read it aloud. According to South Korean media The Chosun Daily, the heartfelt letter had Ahn asking Da-bin to always be humble, honest and have a generous heart that loves others. The late actor advised his son to do your best in everything, keep time strictly, and learn to manage failure and sorrow with inner peace. He also reminded his son to never lose himself, no matter how difficult the situation. Jung, 52, also delivered a eulogy, sharing fond memories of his experience working with Ahn in China for period film Musa (2001). According to The Korea Times, Jung described Ahn as a man of great consideration who never wanted to be a burden, and of a modesty and restraint that kept him from putting himself first. Even under difficult filming conditions, he always made a point of greeting everyone by their names and greeting us with a smile, said Jung, praising Ahns depth of kindness as immeasurable. He was a truly beautiful person with the profound dignity of a human being who treated everyone with consistent understanding and love, Jung added. Ahn was a pillar of South Korean cinema, delivering versatile performances in more than 140 films since his debut as a child actor in The Twilight Train (1957). He also dedicated his life to the development of Korean film-making, serving as a core member of the countrys prominent film festivals, such as the Busan International Film Festival.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actors-lee-jung-jae-jung-woo-sung-and-film-community-bid-final-farewell-to-veteran-actor-ahn-sung-ki
Work of a vet: Going beyond treatment to include pathology and biosurveillance,"Jan 11, 2026, 11:35 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 03:52 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/54ab0f5a85950b303ef4a23205a7b0c152f7301de15b8ccb76168e6c71b8a029,Dr Lee Heejun is a veterinarian at the Animal & Veterinary Service.PHOTO: NPARKS,"['Pets', 'Animals', 'Animal welfare']","SINGAPORE –In a quiet room at the Centre for Animal and Veterinary Sciences (CAVS), the air is cool and smells faintly of disinfectant. While many veterinarians spend their mornings greeted by barking dogs or purring cats in a clinic, my day begins with a silence filled with unanswered questions. I am a veterinarian at the Animal&Veterinary Service (AVS), a cluster of the National Parks Board. My patients are no longer living, but they still have stories to tell – stories that I am tasked to uncover. Whether I am performing a post-mortem examination to give a grieving owner closure, investigating a case of suspected animal cruelty or searching for signs of diseases that could threatenSingapores national biosecurity,my work is a different kind of veterinary medicine. It is forensic and scientific, yet paradoxically, deeply emotional. Reflecting on my diverse career journey, people often ask why I chose public service instead of the more traditional route of a private clinic. The answer comes down to how I can more broadly contribute to the lives of many. Like many veterinarians,my love for animals started at a young age. I was the child who stopped to admire every creature, no matter how small. While other kids watched cartoons, my favourite TV series growing up was the classic nature documentary, Planet Earth (1986). My family kept small pets – fish, hamsters, chicks – and I adored them. However, they eventuallydied,as all pets do. I was heartbroken and confused. I remember feeling helpless, wishing I knew why they had to die and what more I could have done. That desire for answers sparked my first interest in becoming a veterinarian. As I went through veterinary school, my perspective widened. While private veterinarians do heroic work saving one precious life at a time, working for theGovernmentwould allow me to make decisions that could protect thousands. I was also drawn to the variety of roles AVS offered, allowing veterinarians to explore diverse career paths, from policy-making to border control to pathology. My own career has been a testament to this variety, spanning different aspects of Singapores animal health system. My first role was at the Animal Quarantine Centre. There, I monitored imported dogs and cats, ensuring they were healthy and free from exotic diseases like rabies. It was a role that taught me how to balance compassion with vigilance, ensuring the welfare of pets in isolation while upholding the biosecurity measures that keep Singapore safe. Later, I moved to a role inveterinary licensing, which posed a different challenge. There, I was not treating animals; I was regulating the professionals who do. Evaluating complaints was never easy, but it taught me that for animal welfare to truly thrive, people need a veterinary community built on trust, communication and high standards. Today, at CAVS, I feel I have come full circle. I am finally able to answer the question my younger self always asked: Why? When a beloved pet dies suddenly and the owner is distraught, my work can provide the closurehe or she needs to heal.When an animal is a victim of abuse, my findings provide evidence for legal proceedings. And then there is the ongoing biosurveillance work. We are constantly testing for zoonotic diseases – illnesses that can jump from animals to humans. By understanding how an animal died, we can prevent outbreaks that could affect both animal and human populations. This is the heart of Singapores One Health approach – the idea that human, animal and environmental health are inextricably linked. Looking back on my journey, I am reminded that veterinary work is not only about treatment, but also about the quiet, behind-the-scenes efforts that keep Singapores environment safe for both people and animals. As pet owners, you play a critical role in the One Health ecosystem. Many of the cases I see on the table are preventable. The best way to honour your pet is to be proactivewhile it is still with you. Here is what every pet owner should know. You know your pet best. If you notice small changes – like a drop in appetite or low energy – do not ignore them.Many post-mortems reveal conditions that were present for a while.It is always better to be safe than sorry. Vaccinations do not just protect your own pet, but they also stop diseases from spreading to other animals inthecommunity. If you are getting a new pet, ensureit comesfrom a reputable licensed source. My time in the quarantine sector showed me that illegal imports often bring in diseases that can be devastating for both new owners andlocal animals. If you face the heartbreak of a sudden loss, know that asking for a post-mortem is not just about finding a cause of death. It can provide you with peace of mind and help protect the other pets in your community. Dr Lee Heejun is a veterinarian with the Animal & Veterinary Service.

The private sale of a high-grade copy of Action Comics No. 1 was announced on Jan 9. Fewer than 100 copies are known to exist, said Mr Vincent Zurzolo, president of Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect, which negotiated the sale. The sale price makes the issue one of themost expensive comics ever sold. The auction record remains with Superman No. 1, from 1939, which sold for US$9.12 million in November. This is the advent of the golden age of comics, and Action Comics No. 1 is the holy grail of holy grails, Mr Zurzolo said in an interview.Action Comics No. 1 is widely considered to be the first American comic book to include superheroes and contributed to a rapid increase in the genres popularity in the mid-20th century. Both the buyer and seller asked to remain anonymous. The history of this particular copy, which originally sold for 10 cents, is a saga of its own. In 1996, Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage purchased it from Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect for US$150,000, Mr Zurzolo said. In 2000, the comic was stolen from Cages home during a party and remained missing until 2011, when it was discovered in a storage unit in California, Mr Zurzolo said. During the 11 years it was missing, the issue skyrocketed in value, Mr Stephen Fishler, chief executive officer of Metropolis and ComicConnect, said in a news release. The comic was returned to Cage, who sold it for US$2.2 million at auction. If this wasnt stolen, it would have been sold with the rest of his collection much earlier and would have sold for far less, Mr Zurzolo said. In essence, because of the theft and recovery, Nicks windfall on this comic book was enormous. The Certified Guaranty Co., which specialises in authenticating and grading collectibles, gave the issue a grade of 9.0, meaning the comic is well-preserved but has minor defects. It joins several other comics that have fetched multi-million-dollar prices at auction and in private sales. At least eight copies of Action Comics No. 1 have now sold for more than US$1 million, according to the CGC.

RIP fine dining in Singapore? Not so fast,"Jan 10, 2026, 02:15 PM","Jan 10, 2026, 02:15 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a981888db120bb658abf37dd95a008c2bfb280eca71c7794a51a8427f709a2ac,"(From left) Chef Sebastien Lepinoy of Les Amis in its newly renovated kitchen, Chef Julien Royer of Odette, which reopened recently after extensive renovations.ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG, ODETTE","['Food and drink', 'Fine dining', 'Singapore Michelin Guide', 'Chefs', 'Restaurants/Eateries']","SINGAPORE – Looking at theemaciated list of one-Michelin-starred restaurants in Singapore, it is tempting to sound the death knell for fine dining. These are restaurants most people cannot dine at often because the meals do not run cheap. When they do dine at one of these establishments, they sit through hours-long, multi-course meals that are at odds with the way people like to eat these days. This scenario is played out across the world – in China, the United States and Europe. The South China Morning Post reports that Chinas fine-dining scene has taken a hit, with diners holding back amid economic uncertainties. Multinational finance and business news website Business Insider reported in 2025 that fine-dining restaurants in the US have been hit by skyrocketing costs, labour shortages and potential tariffs. Chefs and owners there, like the ones here, are countering the headwinds by injecting fun into meals, changing concepts and working to seek new groups of diners. Chefs and restaurateurs in Britain have been hit by the same problems, with the BBC reporting on the spate of Michelin-starred restaurant closures there. Despite the doom and gloom, chefs and owners of fine-dining restaurants here say they are holding their own. Some havefurther invested in their restaurants. Three-Michelin-starred Odette at the National Gallery Singapore recently reopened after extensive renovations that took three months and cost about $2 million. In 2025, Les Amis at Shaw Centre, also with three stars, overhauled its kitchen to the tune of $2 million. That was just part of ongoing renewal and refurbishment works to the restaurant, which celebrates its 32nd birthday in 2026. And yet, 2024 and 2025 had seen a slew of one-Michelin-starred restaurant closures. In 2024, the Singapore Michelin Guide listed 42 one-starred restaurants. When the 2025 guide launched, the number was 32. Now, with more closures, it has dropped to 29. Did Singapore have too many Michelin-starred restaurants? The guide now lists 39 starred establishments. Mr Benedict Lee, 37, a culinary and catering management lecturer at Temasek Polytechnics School of Business, says: The data points to a dining scene that remains prestigious, but is undergoing market correction. He puts the closures in a larger context. Increasing labour costs add to the challenging operating environment restaurant owners have to navigate. Changes in consumer behaviour post-pandemic have worked to reduce the frequency of high-ticket dining. He says: Younger diners, in particular, seem to associate special occasions less with formal multi-course meals and more with convivial settings that emphasise comfort, flexibility and shared experiences. Another trend, he adds, is the availability of premium ingredients in stores and online. Consumers today can easily access products that were once the domain of high-end restaurants, he says. Some examples he cites are live Tsarskaya oysters from France that were sold at FairPrice Finest supermarkets during the festive season, and high-end beef such as Spains Rubia Gallega and Japans Miyazaki A5 wagyu, sold at butcher shops and by online suppliers. This availability means diners who enjoy hosting can recreate elements of a fine-dining experience at home, which reduces the exclusivity that restaurants once held, he says. Chef Julien Royer, 43, of Odette says: These closures are very unfortunate. It shows there are not enough guests in Singapore for so many great restaurants because there are great restaurants. But tourism figures are up. I think people are interested in visiting Singapore again. We have noticed a whole new wave of diners from China, Indonesia and Europe in the past six months to a year. So, you can feel something is changing. Chef Zor Tan, 39, of one-Michelin-starred Born, says: We definitely have a wide variety of concepts here, and competition in the fine-dining space is very strong – and still growing. But I see that as healthy. It pushes all of us to refine our ideas, improve our standards and be clearer about our identity. His 39-seat restaurant opened in 2022 in the historic Jinrikisha Station in Tanjong Pagar. While many of the chefs interviewed hedged on the question of whether there are too many starred establishments in Singapore, chef Sebastien Lepinoy, 52, of Les Amis offers a contrarian view. The French chef, who worked with legendary chef Joel Robuchon and headed Cepage in Hong Kong before coming here to head Les Amis in 2013, says he cannot help but compare the restaurant scene here with the one in Hong Kong. He says both cities have roughly the same population and well-travelled people. Hong Kong has 74 Michelin-starred restaurants, compared with 39 in Singapore. He feels there are not enough three-Michelin-starred establishments here. He says: In Hong Kong, they have three-star Italian restaurants, three-star Chinese restaurants. Three-star Japanese restaurants. We miss this diversity in Singapore. We have two French restaurants, one Nordic one. Many of the chefs interviewed say the surfeit of restaurants is not the problem. The real problem is sameness. Chef Mirko Febbrile, 33, of Somma, says: If many restaurants are doing the same thing, then, yes, the market feels crowded. But if each has a distinct voice, then diversity strengthens the scene. So, the issue isnt too many, its too similar. Competition is only a problem when originality is missing. The 39-seat fine-dining restaurant opened in 2024 at lifestyle enclave New Bahru. In the last two years, he says, costs have increased, expectations have stayed high and diners have been more cautious. Weve remained resilient by being very clear about who we are and what we stand for, he says. Rather than chasing volume, we focused on consistency, integrity and building trust with our guests. The result isnt explosive growth, but stability and a deeper relationship with our guests. Like him, chef Lepinoy thinks identity is key to success. He says the three three-Michelin-starred restaurants here have distinct identities: classic French, contemporary French and Nordic. He says: Many restaurants in Singapore do not have a strong identity. There are some restaurants you may like. But how do you recommend them to your friends? How do you explain what kind of restaurants they are, what cuisine they serve? When you come to Les Amis, you know what you will get. You will get the bread, the butter, sauces with cream. Im not saying this is good or not good. Im saying the identity is very clear. Restaurants that do not differentiate themselves might be doomed. Ms Chai Karim, 29, of Gaia Lifestyle Group, which runs the newly opened Loca Niru – where Japanese chef Shusuke Kubota crafts meals with ingredients sourced from Japan and Asia – says: Singapores fine-dining scene is moving beyond technical excellence towards more holistic experiences. Diners today want a sense of purpose: a story behind the food, the space and the people. That could mean heritage, sustainability or cultural dialogue on the plate. I think the future belongs to restaurants that balance authenticity with innovation, while staying grounded in fundamentals like flavour, warmth and genuine hospitality. Of course, these chefs and owners have a vested interest in keeping the fine-dining scene alive, but there are arguments for having a thriving fine-dining scene. That Singapore needs one is clear to chef Louis Han, 36, of one-starred Nae:um. He says: It would be great if every city has a fine-dining scene. For Singapore especially, it is a regional hub, a multicultural, metropolitan city with a high standard of living and easy access to premium ingredients from all over the world. A dynamic fine-dining scene is a good match to the pulse of the city. Chef Kevin Wong, 32, of one-starred Seroja, which serves food inspired by the Malay Archipelago, likens haute cuisine to haute couture. He says: The different layers of dining experiences we have in Singapore create a city that is vibrant and energetic. Every type of dining is essential, and this is what makes Singapore so attractive. Not every country has a hawker culture. Our hawker culture is amazing. But having a range of different experiences creates diversity for locals and tourists. Executive chef Martin Ofner, 31, of three-Michelin-starred Zen, adds: Just look towards Scandinavia. A strong fine-dining scene sets the ceiling for an entire food culture. It raises standards, attracts international talent and creates an environment where young cooks can learn discipline, structure and excellence. The good part is, those skills dont always stay in fine dining. They eventually filter into casual restaurants, bakeries and new concepts across the city, benefiting society and the culinary landscape as a whole. Chef Mano Thevar, 36, of two-Michelin-starred modern Indian restaurant Thevar, says the Government can continue to promote home-grown culinary talents, support initiatives that promote the rich food culture here and showcase the diversity in the restaurant scene to draw visitors and locals. Temasek Polys Mr Lee thinks a credible fine-dining ecosystem is strategically important for Singapore. He says: At the branding level, having Michelin-starred restaurants and a globally recognised guide positions us alongside major restaurant cities, and supports Singapores pitch as a regional business and lifestyle hub, which in turn feeds into tourism revenue. Like chef Ofner, Mr Lee believes these kitchens function as high-intensity training grounds. So, while fine dining may only ever serve a small slice of diners directly, it punches far above its weight in shaping skills, standards and Singapores international reputation as a serious food city, he says. On his part, Borns chef Tan is focusing on what has worked for him. He says: In 2026, I want to stay curious and stay honest. My focus is on consistency, the guests journey and storytelling. If diners feel something when they eat – a memory, a sense of place, an emotion – theyll keep coming back. Odette is marking its 10th anniversary in a big way. The 40-seat restaurant at the National Gallery Singapore reopened with a new look after closing for three months in 2025 for renovations, and there are collaborations with big-name chefs coming up. Chef Royer says: I think 10 years is a good mark of maturity, and the restaurant has, touch wood, been doing really well in the last 10 years. I thought it was a good point for us to improve the facilities for our guests and for ourselves, and take a pause to reflect on that milestone. Ive been taught by great people in the industry that even after 10 years, a restaurant needs to keep growing. So, either you rest on your laurels or you take a risk and invest for the future. We believe that this refresh is a necessary step to deepen our commitment to a more intentional and honest approach to fine dining. The renovations, he estimates, cost about $2 million. Odettes original pastel interior has been replaced by warm neutrals, the work of Singapore-born Sacha Leong of London- and Sydney-based design studio Nice Projects. He had created the restaurants original interiors. New lighting, chairs upholstered in mohair velvet and marquetry panels lend the restaurant a grown-up, sophisticated look. At the entrance is a paper sculpture by Singaporean visual artist Dawn Ng, the colours inspired by ingredients. The kitchen has also been overhauled. The new countertops are 95cm tall, 10cm higher than before, to make them more comfortable for the team. There is also a new exhaust system and more space to work in. Odette offers a five-course lunch menu priced at $368 a person, and a seven-course menu at lunch and dinner at $468 a person. The food has also evolved, chef Royer says. When we first opened, what we were cooking was French, very French, he adds. Now, I believe that the DNA is French, because thats the way I was trained, but the cuisine is a lot more infused with Asia. So, I like to say we are influenced by Asian sensibilities, Asian finesse. It comes from his having been here for more than a decade, travelling and dining in the region and eating with his team. He says: I think of people as an influence on the way you cook. Thats the beautiful story of and the language of cuisine. I cannot cook the same food in Paris, Melbourne, New York and Singapore. The sense of place is very important. On the menu, the Crab Contrast course features Norwegian king crab leg slow-cooked and served with tarragon oil bearnaise sauce, with a chilli crab mantou on the side. The main course, Aged Duck Voyage & Tradition, uses Cherry Valley duck from Perak. It is brined, glazed with maltose, air-dried and then dry-aged for two weeks, and served with quince, parsnip puree, tardivo radicchio and a pomme souffle. Served on the side is a bowl of Koshihikari rice with duck leg confit and gizzard from the bird. Chef Royer says the team had tried out six different types of duck before finding one that yielded tender meat and, more crucially, crisp skin. That it is available fresh from Malaysia is a bonus, he adds. He is working with new ingredients, and diners might see Hanwoo beef – newly allowed into Singapore from Jeju Island in South Korea – on the menu. Also in the cards, a new veal sweetbreads dish which features corn from Taiwan. He has also been getting morel mushrooms from a supplier in China. I feel like sometimes, as a French chef, it is tempting to use ingredients that Im familiar with and source the best produce from France, he says. But theres a lot to discover in Asia. And in the next 10 years, that is what I want to do. I want to spend more time travelling in Asia, especially China. He will also be collaborating with British chef Daniel Calvert of three-Michelin-starred Sezanne in Tokyo in February; French chef David Toutain of two-Michelin-starred Restaurant David Toutain in Paris in March; and German chef Jan Hartwig of three-Michelin-starred Jan in Munich in October. Meanwhile, chef Royer is also tending to his two other restaurants – Claudine in Harding Road, now in its fifth year, and Louise in Hong Kong, now in its seventh year. He might, he allows, open a casual place with good cocktails and ugly delicious food. All that, and running a three-Michelin-starred restaurant too? I feel very full of energy, he says.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/food/rip-fine-dining-in-singapore-not-so-fast

It was well known that while the Indian economy had settled into a quick trot, consumer demand was uneven and top-loaded – expensive cars and condos were seeing strong demand, while purchasing power in the hinterland, where the majority of Indians live and buy goods like two-wheeled vehicles, had been soft for the past few years. But record December-quarter earnings reported in January by TVS Motor, another two-wheeler giant, prompted market watchers to sit up and take notice. While income tax trims early in 2025, and a consumption tax cut in September no doubt played a part, it appears that rural demand is indeed reviving. And that can only spell good news for Indias US$4.2 trillion (S$5.4 trillion) economy, which in 2025 passed Japan to emerge as the worlds fourth-largest. We see the spurt in the health of our loan books and revival of demand for credit, says a top banker at a prominent microfinance lender. Both rural and urban segments are ticking over nicely, and there is a clear lift in rural purchasing power. A National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development survey found that 42.2 per cent of rural households saw their incomes grow in 2025, with about 80 per cent of households reporting higher consumption. A recent survey of 30 chief executives conducted by the respected Business Standard financial daily found that more than eight in 10 of them had plans to make fresh investments or expand capacity in 2026. Official government projections are for the economy to finish the fiscal year to March 31 with 7.4 per cent growth, improving from the previous years 6.5 per cent. But since the economy clocked 8.2 per cent in the fiscal second quarter ended Sept 30, 2025, this would suggest a deceleration in the second half of the fiscal year. Indeed, the central banks new forecast is for 6.8 per cent growth in the fiscal year to March 2027. But while growth rates undoubtedly are important markers, it is the broad-based improvement shared by the banker – particularly the improvement in rural demand – that is worth tracking where India is concerned. If accurate, it suggests that growth is trickling down in what is by any yardstick a highly unequal society, with too much wealth and buying capacity concentrated at the top of the pyramid. That purchasing power is improving in a wider section of people is also a morale booster for a country that in 2025 suffered a series of setbacks. Punitive tariffsimposed by the Trump administrationled to significant job losses in jewellery, garments and marine sectors. US presidential trolling of India as a dead economy triggered nervousness in foreign portfolio investors, which also weighed on the rupee. There have also been questions about the quality of Indian data raised by the International Monetary Fund and some economists. But the empirical evidence now showing up is hard to ignore – even from this distance – and Singaporeans should take note of this growth pole. All the more given the wheeze in big regional economies such as Indonesias and Thailands, and persistent concerns about China. Prospects of broad-based growth in India spell good news for companies such as DBS Bank, Sembcorp, Singtel and CapitaLand – all of which have significant presence in that economy either directly or via significant stakes in key Indian companies. Indeed, the India market has been Singapore investment company Temaseks top-performing portfolio over the past decade. Brisk, all-round growth should also be a political boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who came to power as a development-oriented leader but whose first decade in office could not deliver the growth rates achieved by the predecessor government of Dr Manmohan Singh. A demonetisation exercise early in his tenure is widely acknowledged to have hurt the cash-driven rural economy, and just as it was recovering from that setback, the lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic hammered it again. But there have been significant improvements in infrastructure all along, and the central bank has presided over a sustained clean-up of banks. Inflation is under control, and the government has lately made labour laws more investor-friendly. And even Mr Modis worst detractors have to concede he has delivered stability for his nation in a neighbourhood where upheaval is all too common – just witness the eruptions over the past five years in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. If anything, Mr Modis hand has been strengthened bya string of successes his Bharatiya Janata Party has had in state assembly elections, helping it erase setbacks delivered by the 2024 national poll which cost the party its standalone majority in Parliament. Mr Modis government is today propped up by two key coalition partners, but you would not be able to tell from the confidence with which he governs, much of it stemming from the evident disarray in opposition ranks. These – and the Business Standard survey that suggests local private investment is poised to rise – set the stage for steady growth. That would help ease a major domestic headache – youth unemployment. Abroad, his immediate priority is to get the US relationship back on the rails, without which foreign portfolio investors – who pulled some US$18 billion from Indian stocks in 2025 – will always remain skittish. Even though domestic investors propped up Indian stocks throughout 2025, stocks fell sharply on Jan 8 because of nervousness in information technology services companies about fewer new orders from the all-important US market, and talk of more tariffs. US President Donald Trump on Jan 7 approved a Bill thatimposes a 500 per cent tariff on goodsimported from countries that buy Russian oil, which includes India. The turn could come when the long-awaited tariff deal with the US is finally clinched. A deal would bolster the rupee, and returns on Indian investments would not then be crimped when translated into home currencies. The agreement is delayed apparently because Mr Trump is not satisfied with Indias third and most recent offer, while New Delhi anticipates a significant weakening of Mr Trumps position in the months to come and sees no gain in conceding too much too soon. Given Indias multiple challenges over 2025 – including a brief war with Pakistan – New Delhi has handled the economy well enough. Its challenge for 2026 is to make this growth-plus-stability a more enduring feature.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/indias-economy-may-be-shifting-from-speed-to-strength-and-thats-a-win

Banking stocks led the gains. Shares of DBS Group rose by more than $2 to hitan all-time high above $58 on Jan 7, before ending the week at $57.60. OCBC Bank also crossed the $20 mark for the first time on Jan 7, before closing the week at $19.80. With interest rates expected to ease further in 2026, Singapores banking stocks are becoming more appealing to income-focused investors, supported by dividend yields of above 5 per cent. These payouts could rise further if earnings remain resilient, analysts said. At current valuations, though, UOB stands out as the most attractive pick, with its dividend yield projected at 5.8 per cent based on its Jan 5 closing price of $35.50, said Ms Lorraine Tan, director of Asia equity research at Morningstar. UOB, which has lagged behind DBS and OCBC in share price gains, closed this week at $36.02. The banks, which are heavyweights on Singapores benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), helped propel the index to fresh highs above 4,700 points this week, with analysts now eyeing the 5,000 level within the year. The other notable movers on the STI were the property developers, including City Developments, which rose more than 10 per cent through the week to close at $8.87; Hongkong Land, which rose around 9.3 per cent to close at US$7.73; and UOL, which was up by around 7 per cent, closed the week at $9.35. Jardine Matheson closed the week at US$74.72, up by more than 9 per cent. Singapore Exchange (SGX) rose over 2 per cent to close the week at $17.51 after an eventful start to the year, which saw it celebrating the STIs 60th anniversary andrebranding its equities business. The groups equities business is now known as the SGX Stock Exchange, a move that reinforces equities as a core pillar of SGX Groups multi-asset ambitions, while highlighting their importance to Singapore as an international financial centre, SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye noted. The rebranding from SGX Securities follows the completion of the Equities Market Review Groups work in November 2025 after a year-long effort by the SGX and the central bank to implement measures aimed at reviving investor interest in the local stock market. In 2025, the average value of securities traded daily on SGX rose 21 per cent to nearly $1.5 billion – the highest level since 2010 – while retail participation rose to a four-year high, data released on Jan 9 showed. Mr Loh said recovery in initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025 helped drive interest, with more than $2.4 billion in total funds raised during the year, the highest since 2019. The exchange chalked up its first listing of the year on Jan 6 with Concord New Energy, whose shares closed the week at 6.3 cents, up 12.5 per cent since debuting on the SGX Mainboard by way of introduction. Mr Liu Shunxing, chairman of the Singapore-headquartered renewable energy company, said its secondary listing on the SGX marks an important step in advancing its global business strategy. By listing here, we are aligning our company with a market that will allow us to capture a generational growth opportunity at the convergence of AI and sustainable energy. Concord New Energy first listed in Hong Kong in 2007 and has a current market value of HK$2.6 billion (S$429 million). The group manages 83 wind and solar power plants globally, with a presence in North America, Europe and Asia. A second company, UI Boustead real estate investment trust (REIT), is also gearing up for a listing in Singapore as early as March, Bloomberg reported, quoting people familiar with the matter. The REIT unit of Boustead Singapore is aiming to raise as much as $900 million, making it one of the largest offerings in Singapore in recent years. It will begin taking investor orders as soon as February. The REITs IPO portfolio will include more than 20 leasehold properties in Singapore and two freehold properties in Japan, for a total agreed property value of $1.9 billion, Bloomberg reported. Digital Core REIT, which manages data centres globally, said on Jan 5 it has secured a 10-year lease with an investment-grade global cloud service provider for its vacant Linton Hall data centre in Northern Virginia. The deal will raise the proportion of space that is rented out across the portfolio to 98 per cent, from 81 per cent, and is expected to bring in about US$14.8 million (S$19 million) a year in rental income. Based on the REITs 90 per cent ownership of the property, this works out to about US$13.3 million – around 35 per cent more than what the site was previously earning. The lease will begin on Dec 1. It will increase the share of rental income to 82 per cent and lengthen the average remaining lease term across the portfolio to nearly six years, chief executive John Stewart said. He added that the deal marks a strategic reset for the REIT and that the new property will make up about 10 per cent of revenue. Following the announcement, DBS Group Research, UOB Kay Hian, Bank of America and Citi reiterated their buy calls on Digital Core REIT, citing expectations of higher distributions to unitholders and more attractive valuations. The REIT closed Jan 9 at 54 cents, up nearly 1 per cent through the week. With real estate transaction activity and yields expected to stabilise as interest rates ease in 2026, analysts said the Singapore REIT sector continues to offer opportunities for gains, even after its strong performance in 2025. Beyond data centre REITs, analysts have also flagged those withhigh-quality office and retail assets in Singaporeas potential outperformers in 2026. Shares of Nam Cheong, which builds and charters offshore support vessels for the oil and gas industry, rose by more than 8 per cent this week, closing Jan 9 at $1.06. No announcements were made, although the jump came as oil prices turned more volatile in the wake of the US capture of Maduro, the seizure of several Venezuelan tankers in the Caribbean by the US in attempts to control Venezuelas oil exports, and escalating protests in Iran. Other offshore-related stocks fell, though. ASL Marine dropped by more than 10 per cent, finishing the week at 26 cents, while Marco Polo Marine fell 6.6 per cent, closing at 16 cents. Shares of Wee Hur rose by more than 8 per cent this week, closing Jan 9 at 80 cents apiece. The property group on Jan 6 commenced development of Wycombe Abbey School (Singapore) in Hougang Avenue 3. The project is part of Wycombe Abbey International Schools broader expansion in Asia, with campuses in mainland China and Hong Kong. Markets will continue to be volatile next week as more developments on Venezuela emerge, and also depending on what US President Donald Trump decides to say or do. Gold prices, which are now over US$4,500 per ounce as its role as a safe haven asset class grows, could be one to watch. The US is also set to release its December inflation data on Jan 13, a key indicator watched by the Federal Reserve that could influence the markets expectations for future interest rate moves.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/dbs-ocbc-break-new-records-sgx-rises-amid-volatility-in-venezuela

Stop saying no more bubble tea in 2026: How to set realistic New Year resolutions,"Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a89d8304114adf11ca082d49cede8c2d30115aa29539e0c12f785727cd360133,2026 gives me the chance to set more practical resolutions that are attainable.ST ILLUSTRATION: CEL GULAPA,"['ST Headstart', 'ST Young & Savvy', 'Invest']","SINGAPORE –Thenew yearhas just begun, and with it, the setting of many unrealistic expectations that I have no hope of ever fulfilling. In previous years, I said things like no more bubble tea, exercise more, save more money and cut down on my travel spending!. None of those things ever came to pass. Some people try to get around this by setting resolutions that will definitely be achieved with no effort or that are vague enough that any little bit counts – things like save more could technically be achieved if I saved $1 more this year. Sometimes, resolutions are also based on what we see other people doing. Just opening Instagram during the last week of 2025 showed me lists of resolutions that perhaps work for others but are not tailored to my needs. Things like be happy or earn more reminded me of my own stop-buying-bubble-tea aspirations. So how do I go about setting useful, practical resolutions that can actually improve my financial health in 2026? I asked some experts for their top tips in goal setting. OCBC investment strategy managing director Vasu Menon said: Instead of vague resolutions, define measurable targets. He added that a way to ensure goals are not abandoned halfway is to break them up, such as setting a monthly savings target, instead of just saying save $20,000 in 2026. For instance, if I said I aim to save 20 per cent of my pay every month, that might be more useful than an annual target. UOB head of group personal financial services Jacquelyn Tan said: Make decisions from clarity rather than fear. On the surface, maybe that seemed rather general, but I realised, when reviewing my insurance policies for one, that decisions can indeed be made out of fear. As ahuge hypochondriac and aperson who has medical anxieties, I always fear the worst and bought insurance policies to cover me in health emergencies. I added any rider the agent said I should, and any other add-ons that he suggested, even if in hindsight, they were excessive or too expensive. Those decisions were made out of a mixture of fear and pressure from the insurance agent, rather than clarity in the types of protection that I wanted. DBS head of financial planning literacy Lorna Tan said that a goal can be to put idle cash to good use, such as investing. When it comes to high-yield savings accounts, there might be more cash than is needed to achieve the interest rates, and the extracan be put to use elsewhere. I guess a lot of my inaction just comes from sheer inertia. After a weeks worth of work, no one really wants to sit down at the laptop to do what I call personal admin – checking bank accounts, opening spreadsheets, paying credit card bills. But perhaps part of my goals could be setting aside time – maybe just once a month on a Saturday afternoon – to sit down and really look through my finances, review them and decide if I can put the money to better use. After consulting the experts, I created a list that hopefully is more realistic than those of previous years: Rather than saying no bubble tea, it seems more realistic to set a weekly cap for the drink. At the rate of price increases in todays economy, $10 may soon only be able to net me one cup of bubble tea. But the commitment would mean a sharp drop from the roughly $20 that I spent on three bubble teas a week in 2025. Cutting the amount in half will also save me from ingesting too much sugar – I hope. In 2025, I took a total of 16 flights, ranging from two hours to nearly 17 hours each time, and yet I earned and claimed a total of zero miles. A few weeks ago, I finally took the first step in miles collecting, by applying for a credit card. Id previously only stuck to debit cards because I didnt want to waste time and brain space thinking about miles or cashback. But after seeing more friends travel around the world for free – all flights redeemed through miles – I think upping my miles game is a good goal. And now that I am open to credit cards, maybe playing the miles game will be something that feels possible. The eventual goal is a free flight to London – some day. The Supplementary Retirement Scheme, or SRS, is a voluntary scheme to encourage people to save for retirement, over and above their Central Provident Fund savings. If contributions are made to the SRS account before Dec 31, one could gain some income tax relief in the following year of assessment. The yearlycapfor SRS contributions for Singapore citizens is $15,300, and the tax relief amount is the exact amount of SRS contributions made. The personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed, which includes the relief on SRS contributions. And while the SRS account does not earn the interest rate of 4 per cent that the CPF Special Account does, funds can be withdrawn with a penalty before the retirement age, rather than being absolutely locked in. SRS funds can also be invested in a wide variety of ways, such as unit trusts, SGX-listed stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This makes it an ideal way to cut down on the income tax I have to pay while allowing me to invest for long-term growth – it seems to be a win-win situation. Having compiled my little list of resolutions, what sort of goals are the real experts setting? OCBCs Mr Menon: In 2026, my goal is to take a more active role in managing my savings and investments to meet the multiple needs of my family. At 62, as a father of two young daughters aged eight and 10, financial planning is something I take very seriously. His aim: to have yield-generating assets as a significant part of his portfolio (bonds for coupon payments, stocks that pay dividends, unit trusts that invest in equities, fixed income), stocks for potential capital growth, and precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty. UOBs Ms Tan: My resolutions are to simplify decisions, strengthen resilience and stay invested in what truly compounds – financially and personally (including investing in personal relationships). I am less concerned with beating markets in any single year but rather more focused on ensuring my portfolio can compound steadily without forcing lifestyle trade-offs during volatility. DBS Ms Tan: This year, I plan to review my investments that are impacted by the low-interest-rate environment, and continue building sustainable multiple passive income flows to fund my retirement lifestyle. I have been contributing to the SRS and my penalty-free withdrawals over 10 years can start from age 62. Most of my SRS savings are invested in local stocks, which performed well last year (2025). Ive started to liquidate some of the stocks that I do not plan to keep in preparation for the penalty-free cash withdrawals that can commence in the coming years. I plan to place the cash component in safer instruments under SRS.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/stop-saying-no-more-bubble-tea-in-2026-how-to-set-realistic-new-year-resolutions
Me and My Money: He sees shoe shining and restoration as a craft and career,"Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e791b54dee8f3a253148895e55d6715bf5589ff0b9e7f0ec2663838cdb930487,"Mr John Chung, founder of Mason and Smith and Margo and Smith, chose shoemaking apprenticeships overseas to hone his craft over going to university.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO","['ST Headstart', 'ST Me & My Money', 'Invest', 'Money Mentor']","SINGAPORE – The traditional services of shoe shining and shoe restoration get a modern twist from Mr John Chung, who has managed to turn them into a viable business. He is the founder of Mason and Smith, which offers artisanal shoe care, and Margo and Smith, which deals in high-end handbag restoration. The business is also Singapores first shoe shine and repair salon with a dedicated luxury handbag restoration division. Mr Chung, 33, started his shoe shine ventures over a decade ago, when he was 21. He was accepted into Nanyang Technological University but chose to forgo higher education to pursue his business. He says: Im very hands-on and want to experience many things. I didnt come from a well-off family so I had to work to buy the things I wanted. It was indeed very difficult juggling studies and part-time work but I told myself one day I will be rewarded for my hard work and kept pushing on. Mr Chung started with just $700 and a fascination for second-hand leather shoes. In 2013, he began buying used leather shoes, restoring them by hand and selling them at local flea markets for a profit. In 2014, he introduced a shoe shine chair concept in collaboration with The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, offering traditional hand-polished shoe shine services from a classic chair set-up. In the following year, he launched Singapores first dedicated shoe shine bar – a concept that combined professional shoe repair with high-quality, hand-finished shoe shining in a refined setting. I developed a strong appreciation for leather as a material – its beauty, durability and ability to withstand the test of time. Some leather artifacts and collectibles can last for decades or even over a century, and the fact that they can be restored and revitalised after years of use truly captivated me, he recalls. To hone his craft, Mr Chung undertook a shoemaking apprenticeship in 2016 under Japanese shoemaker Masaru Okuyama in Hong Kong. He subsequently relocated to Japan to study shoemaking full time, apprenticing with several renowned bespoke shoemakers and immersing himself in traditional Japanese techniques. This magical quality of leather sparked a passion that led me to study the material in depth. I discovered that leather is most commonly used in footwear and bags, which pulled me deeper into the world of craftsmanship. That was the beginning of my journey – and of my love for shoes and bags, he says. His techniques are now showcased at his dual-concept flagship store in Ann Siang Road. He has also launched his own ready-to-wear and made-to-order footwear line, alongside digital initiatives to modernise the leather care experience, such as tele-consultations and digital order tracking. Mr Chung is an A-level holder and his wife, 31, helps to run the business. A:I bought my first stock while serving in the army – it marked the beginning of my self-taught journey in finance and investing. Without formal academic training, I committed myself to learning independently – reading financial news daily, tracking market movements, and staying informed on global economic trends. Over time, I developed a strong focus on equity investing, alongside a growing interest in the Singapore property market, which I study closely out of a deep curiosity for how value is created and preserved over time. Since I do not have a university degree, Ive always treated every subject I pursue as a kind of mini degree – a self-directed course in lifelong learning, grounded in discipline, consistency and passion. Because of my work in shoemaking and restoration, I also invest time in studying leathercraft and footwear construction. Understanding the materials, history and techniques behind each piece enhances my craft and deepens my connection to it. A:I dont collect tangible pieces purely for their potential to appreciate in value – what draws me in are the artistry and story behind each object. Over the years, Ive gathered a few meaningful items that reflect my appreciation for craftsmanship. Among them are vintage footwear from the 1970s and 1980s made by Nikolaus Tuczek, a legendary bespoke shoemaker whose work continues to inspire shoemakers even today. I also collect vinyl records, and one of my most prized possessions is a rare recording by Teresa Teng – a piece that carries both personal and cultural significance. In addition, I own a few select watches crafted by Otsuka Lotec, a small but respected Japanese watchmaker whose mechanical precision and understated design deeply resonate with me. Each item in my collection reflects a moment, a maker or a tradition that I admire. For me, collecting is not about building a portfolio – its about honouring the beauty of craft, history and human expression. A:Ive always had a passion for collecting mechanical items like CDs and cameras – theres something fascinating about the precision and craftsmanship behind them. Music has played a huge role in my life growing up. My dad was a big fan of hi-fi systems, and many of my childhood memories are wrapped in the sounds of songs and tunes that still stay with me vividly. Alongside this love for music, my fascination with shoes grew over time and eventually blossomed into the business I run today. Im also an avid vinyl record collector, constantly drawn to the warmth and authenticity that only records can capture. A:One of my biggest financial mistakes happened early in my investing journey, around the age of 18 to 20. Back then, I would often buy stocks simply because they were popular or seemed like the next big thing. Id scan the news, anticipate price movements, and trade hastily based on headlines – almost like gambling. Many of those stocks performed poorly over time, leading to disappointing results. The experience taught me the critical importance of doing thorough research and exercising patience. A:One of my notable experiences was buying my home during the Covid-19 pandemic. I wanted to handle the entire transaction myself but didnt know where to start, so I began by studying the Council for Estate Agencies, or CEA, textbook. This gave me a solid foundation in the basics of home ownership. From there, I dived deeper – reading books and researching various details to ensure I was well-informed throughout the process. Ultimately, I found a well-valued home in Tampines, which has since appreciated by $200,000. A:Growing up, my family lived simply and frugally, which instilled in me a mindset of making the most out of what you have. That background helped shape the values I brought into my business – prioritising function, sustainability and thoughtful spending over flashy beginnings. A:I wanted to be a footballer. I did join the national junior under-14 soccer team eventually, but I grew out of that dream. A:I own a four-room resale flat in the east. A:A green Volkswagen Golf. A:I would kick-start the day with a good run, have an amazing and nutritious breakfast and spend time with my loved ones. A:I would set aside a portion to donate to those in need, as giving back has always been important to me. Since I was 18, Ive been actively visiting orphanages overseas and have made it a point to give whenever I can. With the remainder, I would invest in property – an area Ive studied closely and believe in for long-term growth and stability. A:Buy a second-hand item, add value to it, sell it and continuously flip it multiple times with various different products for profit. This is probably the best way to increase that small pot of cash and grow it quickly.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/me-and-my-money-he-sees-shoe-shining-and-restoration-as-a-craft-and-career

Even for a continent whose leaders have grown used to TrumpÕs repeated assault on longstanding alliances in Europe, the renewed targeting of Greenland left officials shaken, appalled and nervous, according to several of the officials. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)NYT","['United States', 'Donald Trump', 'Credit/Debit cards', 'Banks and financial institutions']","WASHINGTON-The US banking industry is warning that President Donald Trumps plans to lower credit card costs would make credit less available and hurt consumers and businesses. Mr Trump said on Jan 9 that effective Jan 20, the first anniversary of his administration, he was calling for a 10 per cent cap on credit card interest rates. We will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, he said on Truth Social. Five associations representing US banks responded that they shared the Presidents goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit. At the same time, evidence shows that a 10 per cent interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small-business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the associations said in a joint statement late on Jan 9. If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers towards less regulated, more costly alternatives. The statement was issued by the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum and Independent Community Bankers of America. Credit cards are the primary source of consumer credit in the US. Costs and outstanding balances have soared in recent years as people increasingly rely on them to maintain spending, even for basic necessities. According to data from the Federal Reserve, the total outstanding credit card debt exceeded US$1.23 trillion (S$1.6 trillion) at the end of September – the fourth-largest source of household debt, after mortgages, student loans and car loans. Interest rates on credit cards are at least 21 per cent and can reach as high as 38 per cent for borrowers with a higher risk profile, according to the Fed. This is up from an average of around 12 per cent a decade ago. With midterm elections due in November, Mr Trump is under pressure to reduce the cost of living as promised during his 2024 election campaign amid stubborn inflation and consumers complaints that they struggle to make ends meet. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, voiced scepticism that Mr Trump was serious about capping rates, noting that he has sought to shutter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a consumer watchdog. Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke, Ms Warren said in a statement on Jan 9. Trump doesnt care about affordability.AFP",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/us-banks-concerned-over-trump-call-to-slash-credit-card-rates

Wall Streets three main indexes all gained sharply in 2026s first full week of trading, fuelled by increases in materials, industrials and other sectors that have lagged technology stocks in recent years. A Labour Department report showed US employment growth slowed more than expected in December, but a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.4 per cent suggested the labour market was not rapidly deteriorating. Chip stocks rallied, with the PHLX semiconductor index jumping 2.7 per cent to a record high. Lam Research rallied 8.7 per cent to US$218.36 after Mizuho raised its price target on the chip manufacturing tool maker to US$220 from US$200. Broadcom rose 3.8 per cent, Alphabet added 1 per cent and Tesla climbed 2.1 per cent, all lifting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Vistra jumped 10.5 per cent after Meta Platforms agreed to buy power from the companys nuclear plants. On the overall AI theme, investors are getting granular and picking the winners and losers in terms of sub-themes and individual names, said Mr Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. We view that as a more positive development. It means that were getting closer to the monetisation phase, where people can actually see and touch the revenue enhancements that are going to come from this revolutionary technology. Intel rallied almost 11 per cent after Mr Trump said he had a great meeting with the chipmakers chief executive officer, Mr Lip-Bu Tan. The S&P 500 climbed 0.65 per cent to end the session at 6,966.28 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.82 per cent to 23,671.35 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.48 per cent to 49,504.07 points. Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by materials, up 1.8 per cent, followed by a 1.24 per cent gain in utilities. For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 per cent, the Nasdaq rose 1.9 per cent and the Dow added 2.3 per cent. Valuations on Wall Street were relatively high ahead of fourth-quarter earnings season. The S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, down from 23 in November, but above its five-year average of 19, according to LSEG data. Underscoring a recent shift towards stocks that have underperformed in recent years, the S&P 500 value index has climbed about 2 per cent so far in 2026, beating a 1 per cent gain in the S&P 500 growth index. The US Supreme Court said it would not issue a ruling on Jan 9 on the legality of US President Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs. This left investors, many of whom expected a decision, awaiting clarity. Traders anticipate heightened volatility across financial markets if the court strikes down the tariffs. Mortgage lenders rose a day after Mr Trump said he is ordering his representatives to buy US$200 billion in mortgage bonds to bring down housing costs. LoanDepot surged 19.3 per cent, Rocket Companies gained 9.6 per cent and Opendoor Technologies rallied 13.1 per cent. The Philadelphia Housing index gained 5.7 per cent to its highest since October. General Motors shares fell more than 2 per cent after the automaker said on Jan 8 it would take a US$6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments. Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.3-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 48 new highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 140 new highs and 62 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was relatively heavy, with 17 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 16.4 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

Inter came close to gaining revenge for their 3-1 defeat in Naples earlier this season and a win would have opened up a commanding gap at the top but Napolis never-say-die attitude keeps them very much in the title race. Inter move to 43 points, three ahead of second-placed AC Milan who drew 1-1 with Fiorentina earlier on Sunday, while Napoli are third in the standings on 39 points. We played a solid game and remained focused, Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo told reporters. Were happy with this draw because it came after going behind twice. Following some early Napoli pressure Inter took the lead in the ninth minute after the visitors lost possession in the middle of the pitch. Marcus Thuram drove forward before laying off a pass to Federico Dimarco in the area who drilled his low shot into the far corner from a wide angle. Inter began to press high up the pitch, with Napoli struggling to get out of their own half for long periods but out of nowhere the away side drew level in the 26th minute. Leonardo Spinazzolas pass sent Eljif Elmas into the area and his low cross into the six-yard box was met by McTominay who got ahead of his marker Manuel Akanji at the near post to fire past Yann Sommer. Thuram had a header tipped over by Vanja Milinkovic-Savic shortly before the break and the sides went in level at the break. We started well, then were a bit too timid after the goal, but we got back into it and the second half is going to be very intense, Elmas told DAZN at halftime. MCTOMINAY TO THE RESCUE AGAIN Napoli had chances after the interval, with Milinkovic-Savics long clearance sending Rasmus Hojlund through on goal but his shot went narrowly wide and Di Lorenzo headed well off target from a Spinazzola cross. The visitors were left ruing those misses when Inter were awarded a penalty for Amir Rrahmanis foul on Henrikh Mkhitaryan, with Napoli boss Antonio Conte shown a red card for his furious reaction to the referees decision. I dont comment on the referees work, Di Lorenzo said. The team stayed in the game and was rewarded with a draw. Hakan Calhanoglu blasted his spot kick in off the upright and Inter retook the lead with 17 minutes remaining. Napoli, however, refused to bow, and it was McTominay who again equalised with nine minutes left. Matteo Politanos floated cross into the box looked like going out of play but Noa Lang hooked the ball back from the byline for McTominay to volley home from the edge of the six-yard box. Mkhitaryan had an added time deflected shot come back off the post and Inter were denied their seventh successive league win.

The match at King Abdullah Sports City Stadium turned into a thriller, with four goals packed into a breathless phase at the end of the first half. After an even opening spell, Barcelona gradually asserted control before the interval, and were rewarded in the 36th minute when Raphinha burst into the box and drilled a low shot into the far corner to give his side the lead. Real struck back in the second minute of first-half stoppage time when Vinicius Jr collected the ball near the halfway line, surged down the flank, skipped past two Barcelona defenders and finished into the far corner in a stunning solo effort. The first-half drama was far from over and two minutes later Robert Lewandowski was given space in the penalty area and finished with a delicate chip to restore Barcelonas lead, only for the chaos to continue moments before the interval. From a Real corner, Raphinha made a goal-line clearance, but Gonzalo Garcia pounced on the rebound, with the ball striking both the bar and the post before crossing the line, bringing the sides level once more as the teams went into the break. Raphinha struck again for Barcelona in the 73rd minute after drifting into a dangerous position on the edge of the box. Slipping slightly as he pulled the trigger, his shot took a deflection off a Real defender, wrong-footed keeper Thibaut Courtois and went into the net. As the clock ticked past 90 minutes, the temperature on the pitch rose again when Barcelona were reduced to 10 men after Frenkie de Jong was sent off for a foul on Kylian Mbappe. Real pressed hard but failed to make their numerical advantage count, going agonisingly close when efforts from close range by Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono were both kept out by goalkeeper Joan Garcia to give Barcelona their 16th Super Cup title.

Malinin, who was left off the Olympic team four years ago when compatriot Nathan Chen won gold, is a red-hot favourite for gold at the Milano Cortina Games next month having won every competition he has entered since the 2023 Grand Prix Final. The 21-year-old Virginia natives most recent triumph came on Saturday in St. Louis when he cruised to a fourth consecutive national title at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Its such an amazing feeling. I worked so hard, especially after those 2022 nationals, said Malinin. It has such a huge meaning for me, being able to go there and follow in my parents footsteps, being two-time Olympians. Its such an honor and Im so excited for that experience. Naumov finished third behind Malinin and Andrew Torgashev on Saturday. Torgashev also made the team. The 24-year-old Naumov was competing with a heavy heart in St. Louis where, after Thursdays short programme, he held up and kissed a picture of himself as a child holding hands with his parents. He was asked what he had thought about after being named to the team. My parents, what we talked about and how much we discussed this through my entire life, and how much it means to us, and how much the Olympics is part of our family, said Naumov. I thought of them immediately. I wish they could be here to experience it with me but I do feel their presence and they are with me. Former world figure skating pairs champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova died when a plane carrying some of the countrys most promising young figure skaters, as well as parents and coaches, crashed into a U.S. Army helicopter over Washington D.C. Husband-and-wife duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who captured a record seventh national ice dance crown on Saturday, were also among the three ice dance teams that earned a ticket to Milano Cortina. Chock and Bates helped the Americans to win a team gold at the 2022 Beijing Olympics but just missed the podium in the ice dance and settled for fourth. The other ice dance teams are Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik plus Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko.

Fletcher urges fragile Man United players to dig deep after FA Cup exit against Brighton,"Jan 12, 2026, 03:52 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 06:58 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0b3372e6ce6c7d2ae47cfc078fa00c34f13e6a8ae9efdb3417a827e6ea3d8689,"Manchester United interim manager Darren Fletcher reacts after the FA Cup match against Bright & Hove Albion on Jan 11, 2026.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Manchester United', 'FA Cup', 'Ruben Amorim']","MANCHESTER - Darren Fletcher admitted Manchester Uniteds fragile players have lost their confidence after Jan 11s FA Cup exit against Brighton left Old Trafford in turmoil. Managerless, out of both domestic cups at the first hurdle for the first time since 1981-82 and sitting a disappointing seventh in the Premier League, United have rarely been at a lower ebb in their history. Near silence greeted the final whistle as the 2-1 third-round loss ended Uniteds hopes of silverware while some boos rang out as the players trudged off the pitch. Caretaker boss Fletcher, who stepped up from his role as Uniteds Under-18 coach afterRuben Amorims dismissalon Jan 5, experienced the clubs glory days as a midfielder under legendary manager Alex Ferguson. But after a 2-2 draw away to Burnley in the Premier League, his hopes of providing a boost at Old Trafford were frustrated as former United player Danny Welbeck scored for the visitors after Brajan Gruda put them in front early on. It was mixed really, we started okay but the goal knocked the stuffing out of us, Fletcher said. Our passing was quite slow so I challenged them at halftime. It was similar to the game in the week, we needed to move the ball with more tempo. When we got back to 2-1, I thought here we go, the crowd was up, the energy was up, but ultimately we couldnt get the equaliser. I think you can see the players are fragile and need to build themselves up. Its up to them to respond. Uniteds first FA Cup third round defeat since 2014 underscored the litany of problems scarring the club at present. For now, Uniteds hierarchy plan to hire an interim boss until the end of the season, buying them time to search for Amorims permanent successor. Former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who failed in his first spell in charge, and Michael Carrick, a decorated ex-United midfielder sacked by second tier Middlesbrough this season, have been linked with the temporary post. Few have faith that United will hire the right manager after Amorim lasted just 14 turbulent months following the equally chaotic reign of Erik ten Hag, who was axed in 2024. United supporters gave their verdict on the shambolic state of their club by chanting against co-owners Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family throughout the Brighton defeat. And with tricky games against Manchester City and Premier League leaders Arsenal next for United, the atmosphere could be even more toxic by the time they host Fulham on Feb 1, when the 1958 Group plan a demonstration against the ownership. United face a 40-game season, their lowest number of matches in a single campaign since before the First World War. Three points adrift of the Premier Leagues top four, with fifth place likely to bring qualification for next seasons Champions League, they can still salvage a modicum of respect by returning to Europes elite club competition. But Fletcher acknowledged the lack of belief in the dressing room at present is a hinderance to Uniteds hopes of getting back on track. You could see the players are fragile but theyve got to respond. Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football so when you dont have it, you have to dig deep and then the confidence comes back, he said. Its over to them, they need to make sure that they have got a lot to play for this season. This team is still good enough to achieve success this season but they have to dig deep. United defender Diogo Dalot confirmed Fletchers feeling that the clubs turmoil has affected the teams morale. Its really difficult, Dalot said. Its always a period that you have to find ways to solve problems really quickly. Overall very disappointed because we wanted to go through. We have to adapt and go again. Despite the funereal atmosphere at the final whistle, Fletcher insisted United fans will get behind the players if they show more spirit. Out of cups, only Premier League games to play for, the fans werent happy at the end but they have got every right to air their grievances. It wasnt toxic but they showed their disappointment, he said. Im sure if the payers show the right reaction, the fans will get behind them like they always do because there is still a lot to play for in the Premier League this season. United are four games without a win and have tasted victory just once in their last seven games. Fletcher may not be in charge by the time bitter rivals City visit Old Trafford on Jan 17, but he knows a rough road lies ahead for whoever replaces him. Theyve just got to come together. Its only them in the situation and only them that can do something about it. It might not be pretty at times, he said.

The reigning champions, who are undefeated in the league this season, are on 44 points, 11 ahead of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. RB Leipzig, with a game in hand, are third on 29, as many as Bayer Leverkusen and fifth-placed VfB Stuttgart. Its not normal (for such a result), its not a given and we should not forget that, Bayern coach Vincent Kompany said. The first half was really not easy. But I had the feeling that when they get a bit tired, wed create even more chances – and thats exactly what happened in the second half. The hosts did not need long to take the lead when Luis Diazs cutback was turned in by Wolfsburgs Kilian Fischer for an own goal in the fifth minute. It was the third consecutive league game that Wolfsburg had scored an own goal, setting a Bundesliga record. The visitors, however, reacted well with Dzenan Pejcinovic finishing a fine passing move that split open the Bayern defence, to level in the 15th. Diaz turned scorer on the half-hour mark, heading in an Olise cross for his ninth league goal of the campaign, to put the hosts back in front. Olise is the leagues best provider with nine assists so far. The Frenchman then got on to the scoresheet with a curled shot to bag his eighth goal of the season before hapless Wolfsburg notched up their fourth own goal in the last three league matches in the 53rd with Moritz Jenz putting the ball in the net from an Olise cutback. The hosts, who also hit the post with Olise in the 64th and added two more goals through substitute Raphael Guerreiro and Bundesliga leading scorer Harry Kane in a span of 80 seconds, have never lost at home to Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga, having won 27 of 29 matches and drawn two. Olise crowned his superb performance in his 50th Bundesliga match for Bayern with his second goal of the evening in the 76th before substitute Leon Goretzka flicked the ball in from a tight angle in the 88th to make it their biggest win over Wolfsburg.

The Brazilian was criticised in midweek for his behaviour after Liverpools Conor Bradley suffered a serious injury near the end of their Premier League clash on Thursday but ended the week in style with his first goals in the FA Cup. Manchester United bowed out though as they lost 2-1 at home to Brighton and Hove Albion with Danny Welbeck on target against his former club. It is the first time since the 1981-82 season that United have failed to win a round of either domestic cup competition. In other third-round ties, West Ham United enjoyed a break from their Premier League woes as they beat second-tier Queens Park Rangers 2-1 after extra time with new signing Valentin Castellanos heading the winner. Premier League Leeds United beat Derby County 3-1 while third-tier Mansfield Town beat Championship side Sheffield United 4-3 away. After several shocks already in the third round, including sixth-tier Macclesfield knocking out holders Crystal Palace, another one looked possible when Colby Bishop raised the roof at Fratton Park by putting Portsmouth ahead after three minutes against Arsenal, firing in a rebound after a save by Kepa Arrizabalaga. We started the game exactly how we didnt want to, giving them hope and momentum but we managed to turn things around, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who made 10 changes to his starting lineup, told TNT Sports. We had to fight back and credit to (Portsmouth) because they make it difficult for us, especially in the early stages. ARSENAL ENJOY MORE SET-PIECE SUCCESS Record 14-time Cup winners Arsenal were only behind for five minutes as Portsmouth were unable to deal with a set-piece delivery and the ball went in off home player Andre Dozzell. Martinelli glanced in Noni Maduekes corner in the 25th minute to put Arsenal in front and then hit the post soon afterwards from close range. Madueke put a penalty wide just before halftime to keep Portsmouth in contention, but Arsenal eased away after the break as Martinelli converted from a superb pass by Gabriel Jesus. He completed his hat-trick with a header as Portsmouth were again unable to defend from an Arsenal set-piece -- the 17th goal Arsenal have scored from a corner this season. Arsenal are still challenging for silverware on four fronts and face Chelsea in their League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday. In contrast, Manchester Uniteds only focus now will be on the Premier League as they suffered more disappointment in interim manager Darren Fletchers second game in charge, and first at Old Trafford. Having lost to fourth-tier Grimsby Town in their first match in the League Cup this season, the FA Cup represented Uniteds only remaining route to silverware. But Brighton deservedly claimed their first win over United in the competition. Brajan Grudas 12th-minute goal gave Brighton the lead and Welbeck doubled their advantage with a thumping finish midway through the second half. Benjamin Sesko gave United a lifeline but they could not find an equaliser and their misery was complete as youngster Shea Lacey was shown a red card for a second booking. It is the first time 13-time FA Cup winners United have lost in the third round since 2014.

Title hopefuls Arsenal and Manchester United played out a 0-0 draw in London on Saturday, as the two sides lost ground on the top two. Arsenal are third on 23 points and United fifth on 22. Tottenham Hotspur climbed into fourth spot, behind Arsenal on goal difference, with a 1-0 win over Leicester City as a goal from a corner that appeared to go in off former Spurs defender Ashleigh Neville gave her old team the three points. Encouragingly for Spurs, 20-year-old Signe Gaupset was superb on her debut after signing from SK Brann in her native Norway, picking up the player-of-the-match award after an impressive display that lasted just over an hour before she was replaced. Aston Villa came back from a goal down to beat Brighton & Hove Albion 2-1 at home, while Liverpool missed the chance to climb off the bottom of the standings after being held to a scoreless draw at home by London City Lionesses, who are seventh in the 12-team table. The point gained was only Liverpools fourth of the season and sees them remain in the automatic relegation spot, one point behind West Ham and four behind local rivals Everton, who are 10th.

Milan salvage draw at Fiorentina with late Nkunku goal,"Jan 12, 2026, 01:02 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 01:02 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d9b76026cb3ab1fef6c74bc01c991e147add99525ab3f37c354381112b64a377,"Soccer Football - Serie A - Fiorentina v AC Milan - Stadio Artemio Franchi, Florence, Italy - January 11, 2026 AC Milans Christopher Nkunku in action with Fiorentinas Niccolo Fortini REUTERS/Daniele Mascolo",[],"FLORENCE, Italy, Jan 11 - Christopher Nkunku scored in the 90th minute to earn AC Milan a 1-1 draw at Fiorentina on Sunday but, despite extending their unbeaten league run, the visitors continue to lose ground in the Serie A title race with their second stalemate in four days. Milan remain second on 40 points, two behind Inter Milan who could increase their lead when they host champions Napoli later on Sunday, while Fiorentina are third from bottom on 14 points. Im not thinking about it (Inter v Napoli) at all, Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN. We have to think about ourselves, we have to return to winning ways, there are a lot of points still to play for. Milans only league loss this season came on the opening day and after struggling once more against a relegation-battling side -- they also came from behind in Thursdays 1-1 draw with Genoa -- have now gone 18 matches without defeat. Fiorentina spent the early stages on the attack without really troubling the visitors before a quick counter almost let Milan in, with keeper David de Gea coming out to deny Christian Pulisic. Allegri left Luka Modric, Rafael Leao and Adrien Rabiot on the bench, giving Niclas Fullkrug and Ardon Jashari their first league starts, with Fullkrug and Pulisic looking very comfortable together up front. The pair played a neat one-two which launched Pulisic through on goal once more, this time going around De Gea but taking the ball too far wide and his finish ended up in the side netting. The duo combined again, Fullkrug biding his time before finding Pulisic with a backheeled flick and the American hit his shot straight at the keeper. Milan were now finding it easy to open up the home defence but without getting the end product and the opening half ended goalless. We played a good first half, we had chances to score but didnt take them, Allegri said. In the second half Fiorentina pushed a bit more. FIORENTINA TAKE DESERVED LEAD Fiorentina began brightly after the break, Dodos deflected shot looping over the bar and Mike Maignan gathering Robin Gosenss header from the resulting corner. Allegri made three changes on the hour mark, sending on Leao and Rabiot, along with Davide Bartesaghi, but Fiorentina continued to look the better team in the second half. Fiorentina hit the front in the 66th minute from a corner, Pietro Comuzzo rising unchallenged and his glancing header finding the net off the far post. The hosts had failed to register a win in their opening 15 league games but had shown signs of recovery of late and came close to a third successive home win. Substitute Nkunku timed his run to get on the end of Youssouf Fofanas ball and fired past De Gea from a wide angle. Fiorentina still had time to find a winner, but Marco Brescianini smashed his shot off the crossbar from the edge of the six-yard area as Milan survived more late drama.

Delayed Milan ice hockey arena earns IOC praise ahead of NHL return,"Jan 12, 2026, 12:37 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 12:37 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b4c01a59b7153061894fe3ae5c55763a178c66b7f38da0f18ab91809ab0e9217,"2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics - Test Event - Serie A - Final Four Italian Championships - Semi Final - HC Migross Asiago v SG Cortina Hafro - Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, Milan, Italy - January 10, 2026 General view during the match REUTERS/Claudia Greco","['Hockey', 'Olympics']","MILAN, Jan 11 - A new ice hockey arena set to stage top matches at the Winter Olympics received a positive review after test games over the weekend and is due to host the return of North Americas NHL stars to the Games after 12 years, the IOC and the International Ice Hockey Federation said on Sunday. Slow progress and delays in the construction of the Santagiulia arena in Milan, in the southeast of the city, has emerged as one of the main headaches in the run-up to the Olympics, co-hosted by Milan and the Alpine resort of Cortina dAmpezzo from February 6 to February 22. We still have two games to go. But so far, so good, Christophe Dubi, Olympic Games Executive Director said at a press briefing when asked about the review of the venue, held less than a month before the Olympics. This looks fantastic. The last time I came was before Christmas, and this is radically different, he added, noting much progress had been made in recent weeks. The IOC said initial feedback from an NHL delegation, which had raised concerns about the venue in December, including on the quality of the ice, was good. We have a meeting and a tour with them later but so far what weve heard is very positive, said Dubi. IIHF President Luc Tardif echoed his words and added: There is no reason that NHL will not come. Yesterday was a good test... the puck was sliding and there was no bumping. SOME AREAS STILL TO BE FINISHED The arena, which will have a capacity of 15,300 spectators, hosted 4,000 fans per match over the weekend, when testing was carried out by hosting the Final Four event of Italys Championship and the 2025/2026 Italian Cup. Organisers dismissed concerns after a brief delay to the action on Friday night during the inaugural match when a small hole close to one of the goals had to be repaired. That was the first time the ice had been used at all, and so our ice master was expecting much more of this potentially happening and then after that, it didnt happen at all, including yesterday with three matches in a row, said Andrea Varnier, CEO of local organisers Fondazione Milano Cortina 2026. Construction work is still going on inside the venue, with hospitality areas and locker rooms yet to be completed. The media section has also been set up on a temporary basis. Varnier said some behind-the-scene parts of the arena and some of the surroundings might not be fully completed on time. But what is fundamental for the success of the games, which is, first of all, the field of play, the hospitality areas, the arena inside, and most of the features outside will be finished, he said.

Gabriel Martinelli nets hat-trick as Arsenal show set-piece prowess to beat Portsmouth 4-1 in FA Cup,"Jan 12, 2026, 12:01 AM","Jan 12, 2026, 01:09 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/90fb493dff0d2f49a2a099bd45dde04b5c0098be0902886033000f94492d50fe,Arsenals Gabriel Martinelli rising highest out of everyone in the box to head home their second goal in their 4-1 FA Cup away win over Portsmouth on Jan 11.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['FA Cup', 'Arsenal', 'Mikel Arteta', 'Football matches', 'EPL']","PORTSMOUTH–Arsenals set-piece prowess was on full display at Fratton Park on Jan 11 as Gabriel Martinelli scored a hat-trick to help the English Premier League leaders come from behind to beat Championship strugglers Portsmouth 4-1 in an FA Cup third-round tie. This was also the first time in three seasons that the Gunners have reached the fourth round of the knockout competition. We started exactly how we didnt want to... but we managed to turn things around to score from set pieces and we made a difference there, said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. Displaying their dead-ball proficiency, the Gunners scored three goals from corner kicks, with the first two coming in the first half to wrest the lead from Portsmouth, who opened accounts after just two minutes and 34 seconds. Colby Bishop sent the Fratton Park crowd into a frenzy when he tucked the ball home, after Gunners goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was unable to hold on to Conor Chaplins attempt. But the Gunners equalised five minutes later from a corner as Christian Norgaard scrambled the ball home, with Portsmouths Andre Dozzell adjudged to have scored an own goal. Off another corner in the 25th minute, the Gunners went ahead. An unmarked Martinelli headed home at the near post following Noni Maduekes delivery to turn the tables for Artetas side. Madueke could have made it 3-1 in the 43rd minute, but he sent a penalty wide after earning it himself when he was brought down by former Arsenal academy player Zak Swanson. But the third goal arrived in the 51st minute, with Martinelli scoring his second of the evening. Myles Lewis-Skellys quick free kick found Gabriel Jesus, who crossed low for his Brazilian compatriot to slot home at the far post. The Gunners could have scored more against a side who are fourth from bottom in English footballs second tier, but Madueke fired into the side netting in the 71st minute. But Martinelli found himself unmarked a minute later as he headed home from another corner to complete his first Arsenal treble and ensure the Gunners advanced after third-round exits in the last two seasons. It was also the third time this season that Artetas side have scored two goals or more from corner kicks in a match. They had scored two goals from set pieces in a match twice in the Premier League this season – a 5-0 thrashing of Leeds United at the Emirates Stadium in August and a 2-1 comeback win over Newcastle United at St James Park the following month. With victory secured, Arteta sent on 16-year-old defender Marli Salmon for Brazilian centre back Gabriel Magalhaes, with the English teen becoming the youngest Arsenal player to play in the FA Cup. Arteta was also heartened by second-half substitute Kai Havertzs return to action after a long injury layoff due to a knee issue. Having Kai back, Marli making his (FA Cup) debut and Martinelli scoring a hat-trick in an unusual way, thats all very positive, he added. In an earlier fixture, Leeds came back from a goal down at half-time to beat Championship side Derby County 3-1 at Pride Park. Ben Brereton Diaz gave the Rams the lead in the 35th minute but goals by Wilfried Gnonto (55th), Ao Tanaka (59th) and James Justin (stoppage time) sent the Premier League side through. Leeds boss Daniel Farke said: At half-time the message was dont get nervous, the goals are coming, stay on it and stay disciplined, a bit more switch on in our own box because one little detail can be costly in this situation but also, not to allow any counter-attacks and to keep going. Its never easy for the players who are coming in especially where there is so much rotation, so many compliments. It is easy that you could fail in such a game.",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/gabriel-martinelli-nets-hat-trick-as-arsenal-show-set-piece-prowess-to-beat-portsmouth-in-fa-cup
