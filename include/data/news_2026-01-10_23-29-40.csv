Airfares from Singapore to Malaysia soar up to 6 times during CNY period; train tickets sold out,"Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7499c299343d5cabd0914f6141337de0666837ad4c1b8bc60a10e9ac9214cd78,"A two-way trip from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur by air would range from $420 to $1,245 in the days leading up to Chinese New Year.ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG","['Chinese New Year', 'Singapore transport', 'Malaysia']","SINGAPORE – Getting his hands on flight tickets to return to his home town in Ipoh, Malaysia, during Chinese New Year is a feat that Mr Tan Yik Xuan has to pull off every year. Mr Tan, a 26-year-old who works in logistics in Singapore, purchased return flight tickets in October 2025 – four months ahead of Chinese New Year in 2026 – for around $630. He had bought them significantly earlier because he was worried that he would not be able to secure tickets. Describing the higher fare as much more expensive than the usual cost of less than $320 for a round trip during off-peak seasons, Mr Tan said he is still willing to pay more to fly to Ipoh instead of taking a bus because of the shorter travel time and absence of traffic jams. Checks by The Straits Times in the week starting Jan 5 found that a two-way economy class ticket to Ipoh costs between $822 and $1,222 for travel from Feb 14 to 19, more than six times the fare of $124 to $191 for the week before. Those making last-minute travel plans to Malaysia during this festive period are set to pay higher prices. Chinese New Year falls on Feb 17 and 18, with many Malaysians heading home for the reunion dinner that typically takes place on the eve. A two-way trip from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur by air would range from $420 to $1,245 in the days leading up to Chinese New Year, compared with a fare between $99 and $345 from Feb 7 to 12. Meanwhile, round-trip air tickets from Singapore to Penang would cost $628 to $1,049 from Feb 14 to 19, higher than the price range of $107 to $469 for the week before. Responding to STs queries, AirAsia said on Jan 8 that its pricing model reflects supply and demand – where fares will typically be higher when purchased closer to the travel date or for travel during peak seasons. The airline added that it will be introducing over 7,500 more seats on additional flights between Singapore and KL, Penang and Kuching during the upcoming Chinese New Year travel season, starting from Feb 13. Citing commercial sensitivities, national carrier Singapore Airlines and its budget arm Scoot declined to disclose booking figures but said they continue to observe healthy passenger demand during the Chinese New Year period in 2026. For buses, STs checks showed that round-trip bus tickets to KL could range from $89 to $276 for Feb 14 to 19, an increase from the $51 to $153 the week before. A two-way bus ticket to Penang for Feb 14 to 19 could cost $198 to $370, while a similar ticket to Ipoh over the same period could go up to $214 to $330. But from Feb 7 to 12, a week before the festive period, a two-way bus ticket to Penang was priced at $83 to $133, while a similar ticket to Ipoh cost $71 to $104. Malaysian bus operator Causeway Link said it anticipates a significant crowd and a high volume of ticket purchases during the upcoming peak season. It declined to provide ridership figures. It added that it will continue monitoring the situation, with backup buses on standby to support increased passenger demand whenever necessary. To avoid paying too much for a coach ride back to her home town in Batu Pahat in the north-west of Johor, Ms Lim Cin Min, 27, will be taking a Causeway Link bus from Woodlands Checkpoint to the Johor Bahru immigration and Customs before catching another bus from Larkin Sentral bus terminal. The whole journey on Feb 13 will cost her around $8. The insurance agent noted that this is more affordable than taking a direct bus service from Singapore to her home town, which could cost up to $40 during the festive season. She added that she prefers this alternative route, as she finds it more comfortable and efficient to cross immigration herself, instead of being stuck in traffic jams in both Singapore and Malaysia. Following thelaunch of the first electric train service (ETS)from Johor Bahru to KL on Dec 12, 2025, some Malaysians are turning to this new transport option to return home for Chinese New Year. According to ST checks, ETS tickets for services to KL from Feb 13 to 16 are no longer available for booking, as well as those from Feb 11 to 22 for the single daily service from Johor Bahru to Ipoh, with the exception of designated wheelchair spaces. For those travelling to Penang, the same applies for ETS services from KL to Butterworth from Feb 13 to 16. And even for the Keretapi Tanah Melayu Shuttle Tebrau connecting Woodlands Checkpoint in Singapore to Johor Bahru Sentral in Malaysia, there are no available tickets for sale from Feb 13 to 15. Mr Justin K, 29, is among the few lucky passengers who managed to secure an ETS ticket in December 2025 for his ride back to Johor Bahru from KL on Feb 24, 2026. The data analyst, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition of partial anonymity, said he managed to get an ETS ticket only because he extended his visit beyond the peak travel period during Chinese New Year. He will be taking an AirAsia flight to KL on Feb 14, as ETS tickets for that leg were sold out for the week leading up to Chinese New Year when he checked. He paid $230 for a one-way ticket, which he said was more than twice the normal fare. Noting that his ETS ticket cost only RM110 (S$35), including a fare increase of RM20 for the Chinese New Year period, Mr K said this is a much more palatable increase compared with that of airfares. He added that he will be making future journeys back to his home in Malaysia on the ETS – even if he has to book his seat weeks in advance – because of its punctuality, fixed travel duration and comfort.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/air-fares-from-singapore-to-malaysia-soar-up-to-6-times-during-cny-period-train-tickets-sold-out
"Judge slashes lawyers plainly excessive bills from over $108,000 to $34,000","Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/db72e3a13d74f27e33acb451980ad393f879dde688acc35edb189e728e73ee48,Arbiters Law Corporation has filed an appeal to the High Court against the district judges decision.ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG,"['Singapore lawyers', 'Singapore courts', 'Civil lawsuits']","SINGAPORE – A lawyer, who was found in 2024 to haveovercharged a couple for handling a lawsuit over their sons death, has had his bills found to be plainly excessive again in a separate case involving another client. Mr Vijay Kumar Rai of Arbiters Inc Law Corporation had billed this client $108,225 in fees for work done over a seven-month period in 2023 before the trial even started. The amount was slashed to $34,000 by District Judge Chiah Kok Khun, after the client asked the courts to assess the bills. In his written judgment on Dec 22, 2025, the district judge cited the findings of a High Court judge, who had said at an earlier stage of the bill dispute that the fees claimed by Mr Rai were excessive. Arbiters has since filed an appeal to the High Court against Judge Chiahs decision. In December 2024, the Appellate Division of the High Court had found that Mr Rai overcharged a couple who engaged him to file anegligence suit over the suicide of their 31-year-old son. The couple had dropped their lawyers and settled the case on their own for $330,000. After the settlement, Arbiters sued the couple to press for payment of bills amounting to about $370,000. The bill was reduced to $87,000 by the Appellate Division of the High Court in December 2024. The three-judge court said the costs claimed by Mr Rai were so plainly excessive as to amount to overcharging. The Appellate Division also referred Mr Rais conduct to the Law Society of Singapore for a disciplinary inquiry. In the current case, Mr Rai acted for a beauty salon, De Beaute, in a civil suit against a former employee forcoercing other staff to perform treatments on her for freeand pocketing customers monies. His firm took over the case in February 2023 and provided a fee estimate of $70,000 up to the end of trial. De Beaute paid the first seven invoices totalling $33,285, each charging around $4,000 and $5,000 in professional fees. In September 2023, before trial dates were fixed, Arbiters issued an eighth invoice charging $40,000 in fees. De Beaute discharged Arbiters as its lawyers and later engaged Mr Gavin Neo of WongPartnership to handle the lawsuit and the dispute over the bills. In October 2024, a district judge agreed with De Beautes request for the bills to be assessed by the court. Arbiters appealed to the High Court against this decision. Mr Rai argued that he had carried out an enormous amount of work due to the complexity of the matter. The appeal was dismissed in March 2025 by Justice Dedar Singh Gill, who found the amounts in the invoices to be plainly excessive. He said the matter was not as complex as Mr Rai made it out to be. The bills were then assessed by a State Courts deputy registrar, who reduced the fees from $108,225 to $46,000 in August 2025. Arbiters then applied for a review of this decision. Judge Chiah, who heard the arguments, further reduced the bills to $34,000. The sum comprised $30,000 for work done in the preparation and review of affidavits, and $4,000 for attending a pre-trial hearing. In his written judgment, Judge Chiah said he took into account the costs guidelines for tort and commercial cases, the fee estimate initially provided by Arbiters, and the legal costs that were ultimately awarded to De Beaute in October that year after the firm won the suit.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/judge-slashes-lawyers-plainly-excessive-bills-from-108k-to-34k

Wanted: More blood donors of all ages,"Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 06:26 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/4aefe11360c524e7abe66469ece219c72e4f914e6945bf8b35e7810dd145aa32,"Since Jan 2, the upper age limit for first-time blood donors in Singapore has been raised from 60 to 65.ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN","['Blood donation', 'Health Sciences Authority', 'Red Cross', 'Senior citizens']","SINGAPORE – Mr Lian Tian Teng is pumped for his 235th blood donation in a weeks time. While he is among Singapores more prolific donors, the 61-year-old is hoping to induct fresh blood among peers his age. Since Jan 2, the upper age limit for first-time blood donors in Singapore has been raised from 60 to 65, in a move to expand the city-states blood supply in tandem with longer life expectancy and better health in older age. The change means that new donors can give blood up to one day before their 66th birthday, while repeat donors can continue to do so until the age of 75, up to one day before their 76th birthday. Donors must, in general, be in good health, free of infection symptoms and weigh at least 45kg. Local data showed that adverse donor reactions such as fainting and dizzinessdecrease among first-time donorsas they get older. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung had announced the change in June 2025. The new age limit also aligns with practices in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ireland, the Netherlands, South Korea and Britain, which generally allow first-time donors aged 65 to 69. Mr Lian, a Tower Transit facilities executive, said he has been encouraging his friends to give blood donation a try. There is no need to fear – the environment is so cosy and the expertise of the nurses makes it a good experience, said the regular donor at Bloodbank@HSA in Outram. While a handful of new donors in this age group have come forward, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said it is hopeful that the move will see many more seniors like Mr Lian contribute to Singapores national blood programme. HSA chief executive Raymond Chua said: With our ageing population, it is crucial that we tap every safe opportunity to expand our donor pool while maintaining the highest safety standards for both donors and recipients. Meanwhile, efforts to recruit younger donors are starting to bear fruit. The Singapore Red Cross (SRC) noted that there have been close to 900 sign-ups for the YouthInspire club from December 2024 to November 2025. The club, launched in 2024 to encourage those aged 16 to 25 to donate blood, organises ground-up activities to encourage peer-to-peer donor recruitment. SRC also held its own youth-centric roadshows, working with schools and institutions of higher learning to promote and educate young people on the importance of blood donation, and to dispel misconceptions such as blood donation being painful. In 2023, SRC launched the YOUTHphoria award on World Blood Donor Day to inspire more young people to donate blood regularly. It has also rolled out digital initiatives like the DonateBlood app, as well as the HeyBloodBuddy account on Instagram and TikTok to engage the next generation of potential donors. In 2024, those aged 25 and below accounted for 14 per cent of the total donor pool. This was a decline from 2011, when one in three blood donors was a young person. Mr Prakash Menon, group director for SRCs blood donor programme, said that getting more youth to donate blood will be a long-term effort. Drawing from our learnings in 2025, we will scale up successful initiatives while refining our approach, he said. Our focus remains on engaging donors across all age groups through upcoming events, including the National Blood Programmes 80th anniversary celebrations in 2026. Overall donor numbers typically fall during festive periods, school holidays and long weekends. This is because many people travel overseas and become ineligible to donate blood for a period depending on the countries or regions they visit. For instance, donors who have travelled to places with insect-borne diseases may be ineligible to donate for up to four months after their return. Adjunct Professor Chua said: The early part of the year, especially around Chinese New Year, tends to be challenging, and we hope more will step forward to ensure the country has stable blood reserves. Every donation will make a critical difference for many patients across Singapore. We hope that with such changes to age, and with our five blood banks located islandwide at Dhoby Ghaut, Jurong East, Outram, Punggol and Woodlands, more people across all ages would step forward. The Republic had just under 80,000 donors in 2024, or about 1.3 per cent of the population, according to latest available data. In 2025, 14 units of blood were required every hour in Singapore, or about 120,000 units for the year. A standard donation yields one unit, or about 350ml to 450ml. Mr Lian, the veteran blood donor, said he will keep exercising and watching his diet so that he can give blood for as long as possible. What keeps me going? Its my passion and the knowledge that my little contribution can make a difference in saving lives, he said.

Stallholders say HDBs move to make budget meals optional offers some relief amid rising costs,"Jan 10, 2026, 09:00 PM","Jan 10, 2026, 11:09 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/03849458f610480afde7c65507b478e15fdcf0cf9637d3d468c21b45bdecf952,"The move also acknowledges shortcomings in the previous scheme, which had drawn some criticism over uneven food quality and low take-up among customers.ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN","['Coffee shop', 'Food prices', 'HDB', 'Cost of living', 'Singapore inflation']","SINGAPORE – Coffee shop operators and stallholders saidmaking budget meals optionalwill ease some pressure, given the challenges of rising costs. The move also acknowledges shortcomings inthe previous scheme, which had drawn some criticism over uneven food quality and low take-up among customers. The Housing Board announced on Jan 10 that coffee shop operators renewing leases from that date would no longer be required to sell budget meals, a scheme aimed at keeping food affordable in the heartland. Stallholders told The Straits Times that demand for budget meals varies widely, with some stalls selling as few as 50 meals a month while others sell around 50 a day. Several said keeping prices at $3.50 or less often meant serving smaller portions to manage costs. HDB said it does not set budget meal prices, which are proposed by operators and typically priced at around $3.50. At a FoodHub-operated coffee shop at Block 40 Margaret Drive, demand for budget meals varies widely. At Al-Madina Famous Prata Corner, the $2.50 option – consisting of rice, chicken, chicken curry, and cabbage – attracts about 50 customers a month. Stall assistant Rahim said it mainly appeals to older patrons. Young people wont be full, he said, pressing his fingers together to show the modest serving. Its really meant for old people. At Shu Vegetarian, fewer than 40 budget meals are sold monthly. Stall assistant Ng Cheng Yong said the $2.50 meal is the same portion size as a regular dish but without mock meat, leaving only noodles and vegetables. Demand is highest at the economy rice stall, which sells 50 to 60 budget meals daily. Each set, limited to two vegetable dishes and one meat dish with no substitutions, is kept small to meet the price cap, said Mr Wong Yin Keong, 48. This is old peoples food, he said in Mandarin. Mr Paul Kok, managing director of FoodHub, said that some stalls have struggled to offer budget meals priced at $3.50 or less amid rising operating costs. Some operators reduced portions to cope, which sometimes led to customer complaints. Under the new optional framework, operators who choose to offer budget meals will receive more support. HDB-let coffee shops will get a 5 per cent rental discount across the full three-year tenancy instead of just the first year, while privately owned outlets will receive discounts on temporary occupation licence fees. Participating operators must pass the full value of incentives to stallholders providing budget meals. If the amount is acceptable to the stallholders, we will opt in. But if it is not enough to cover expenses, we will listen to their feedback and may decide not to opt in, said Mr Kok. The revised scheme also standardises budget meal requirements. Operators who opt in must provide three meal choices and two drinks, including an economy rice option with one meat and two vegetable dishes, one halal meal, and one breakfast item. Mr Kok said the managers of each FoodHub outlet will discuss with stallholders whether to opt in when leases are renewed, with each outlet making its own decision. Of FoodHubs more than 40 coffee shops, about two are up for lease renewal in 2026. Nearby, at a Koffee Time coffee shop in Block 85 Dawson Road, demand for budget meals is limited, with only about 10 orders a month at the Malay stall. Ms Siti Aliza, who mans the stall, said most customers prefer to pay 50 cents to $1 more for a full meal. Patrons said they understand the constraints that stallholders face. Ms Sharon, 58, who wanted to be known only by her first name, said: They have to work within a price they can sell, so theres only so much they can do. Another patron, who wanted to be known only as Madam Lee, 75, said the portions, though small, suit her needs. What can you expect, given the price? she said, adding that she appreciates the $2 breakfast set of coffee, two eggs, and kaya toast at the coffee shop in Margaret Drive. Not everyone can afford to eat more expensive food, she said. Mr John Tan, 35, who used to own and operate a coffee shop in Beo Crescent in Bukit Merah, said offering budget meals was a challenge. Stallholders were struggling to make ends meet as costs, such as electricity and utilities fees, had gone up, he added. Mr Tan sold the coffee shop in 2024 but continued operating it until late 2025. Veteran food critic K.F. Seetoh said the changes have no impact on operators, who are still collecting rents. But it is good news for hawkers, who will no longer be forced to offer budget meals with little demand. He said stallholders should have an open field to charge whatever they think is fair as they know their customers best. Mr Seetoh, who is the founder of local food guide Makansutra and curator of the Urban Hawker food centre in New York City, added that the changes are an acknowledgment that the previous scheme did not work as intended. It is good the Government has its ear to the ground, but they have to keep listening to the hawkers, he said. Mr Seetoh suggested alternative approaches in the spirit of keeping meals affordable, such as direct subsidies for hawkers. Those who are truly disadvantaged and need cheap or even free meals could be identified through a system similar to the CHAS card. Many hawkers are happy to give them a free or cheap meal and to pay it forward, he said. It is unfair to put the pressure of taking care of the poor on hawkers struggling with the bottom line, he added. Making the scheme voluntary improves its sustainability to some extent, he said. It at least takes the burden away from hawkers.

Property developer UOL and its hotel subsidiary Pan Pacific Hotels Group (PPHG) announced on Jan 10 that it would donate $50,000 towards the scheme. The amount is part of a wider $150,000 donation to fund the UOL-PPHG Community Uplift Programme, which waslaunched in Jurong West in 2023to support children from lower-income families. UOL said on Jan 10 that participation has more than doubled since the programme began, from 57 beneficiaries in 2023 to 120 in 2025. With the expansion, more than 35 families underthe ComLink+ schemein Bukit Merah will receive support through the programme. ComLink+ is a national initiative led by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, bringing together government agencies, social service offices and community partners to support families with children under 21. It helps families build stability and improve self-reliance, and enhances social mobility through coordinated, longer-term support. The programme by UOL and PPHG is run in partnership with the social service offices in Boon Lay and Taman Jurong. In Bukit Merah, the programme will provide support, including weekly mathematics tuition for secondary school students, talent grants for arts and sports enrichment, regular family outings, and a rewards system featuring experiences such as staycations and buffet meals. Outcomes from Jurong West show a positive impact. Feedback from 36 participating families in Boon Lay indicated that 96 per cent of children made new friends, while 63 per cent of parents felt closer to neighbours. About 80 per cent of children said rewards motivated them to study harder, and 77 per cent said organised outings strengthened family bonding. Academic improvements were also recorded, with 41 per cent of 81 primary and secondary students who received mathematics support improving their grades, UOL said. UOL and PPHG will continue supporting ComLink+ children over the next three years through talent grants and interest-based programmes, including culinary sessions, art enrichment, boxing training and graded Korean pop dance classes in collaboration with a dance academy. Education Minister Desmond Lee said the programme provides valuable opportunities for children from ComLink+ families to learn new skills, build confidence and broaden their perspectives. He was speaking on Jan 10 at an annual awards ceremony recognising the achievements of ComLink+ families in the UOL-PPHG Community Uplift Programme at PARKROYAL on Beach Road. Three children were recognised for their efforts in school and personal development, including improvements in academic results and leadership qualities. Mr Lee, who is also Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration, added that partnerships with companies such as UOL and PPHG are key to helping families achieve stability and creating pathways for social mobility. This is a unique model, said Mr Lee, noting the expansion from Jurong West-Boon Lay to Bukit Merah-Queenstown and its potential to be replicated across Singapore. In this model, corporates, social services, and secular and religious organisations work together not as individual partners but as queen bees bringing the whole neighbourhood, community and stakeholders along and anchor in the community, Mr Lee added. He also highlighted ComLink+s key features, describing it as a whole-of-society initiative, involving not just the Government but also community and corporate partners. ComLink+ uses information from multiple sources to understand the full circumstances of each family rather than focusing on issues and individuals, he added. It also places emphasis on active community involvement and families own aspirations.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/uol-commits-150000-to-comlink-programmes-for-children-from-lower-income-families

The fire, involving the contents of a living room in a 12th-floor unit, was extinguished with one water jet. Four people were assessed for smoke inhalation and taken to Singapore General Hospital.

Unlike general lockers which are managed by the students and can hold items such as files and textbooks, these lockers are specifically for mobile devices and are typically handled by school teachers. This follows new guidelines announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in November 2025, banning the use of smartphones during the entire school day. Previously, restrictions applied only to regular curriculum time, with some schools allowing phone use during break times. Under the stricter rules that kicked in from January 2026, secondary school students arenot allowed to use their devices outside lesson timeas well. This includes during recess, periods between lessons and co-curricular activities (CCAs). Madam Agnes Monica, 49, whose son studies at St Gabriels Secondary School, said she supports the stricter phone use guidelines. At her sons school, security guards remind students to switch off their phones upon entry, and devices are kept in general lockers outside the classroom. Recess should be a time to engage with friends and take a mental break from gadgets. Its a short moment to breathe, she said. Madam Agnes, who works in hospitality, said the school has offered an alternative for parents to reach their children, directing them to its general hotline for emergencies. If its really urgent, the school is very cooperative in getting our child to call us back, she said. Her son, Lashaun Gharan, 13, admits that he wishes he were free to use his phone outside of lessons, although he was used to doing without devices in primary school. Now during recess, he has his meal before exploring the school grounds, sometimes on his own or with a friend. The Secondary 1 student said he enjoys learning about the schools history during these breaks. If I had my mobile phone with me, Id probably just be at a table with all my friends, playing games on our phones, he said. While MOE said that students devices would have to be kept in designated storage areas such as lockers or in their bags during school hours, some schools have opted for mobile phone lockers. Nearly 10 schools expressed interest in purchasing phone lockers in late 2025 and early 2026, based on tender documents on government procurement portal GeBIZ. These include secondary schools like Cedar Girls Secondary, Hai Sing Catholic, Admiralty Secondary and Hillgrove Secondary. Wide-Links, an importer and supplier of office furniture, told The Sunday Times in January that it had supplied mobile phone lockers to more than 40 schools, including primary schools, in 2025. These can be locked by students using digital combination locks or smart cards, with teachers having master keys for access. Ms Christine Cheong, the companys marketing director, said schools install the lockers in places that can be monitored through CCTV cameras, such as along corridors or outside the general office. Springfield Secondary School has in the past two years managed to curb excessive device use among students with the help of handphone hotels. In 2023, after the Covid-19 pandemic, the school had observed that students were glued to their phones. At lunch or recess, they would be sitting together, but theyd either be gaming or on social media, said its principal, Ms Eleanor Chia. She added that policing device use during lessons was also difficult, as students hid phones under tables, behind books, or used them during toilet breaks. We felt that our students did not yet have the self-discipline to manage their device use, she said.At that time, the students had to keep phones in their bags and were allowed to use them only during breaks and after school. To address the issue, the school sourced for mobile phone lockers. It spent less than $6,000 on online platform Shopee to buy about 40 mobile phone lockers that were installed in classrooms, and four portable mobile phone lockers for teachers to use during learning journeys or CCAs. Each locker has 48 slots, and is mounted on a wall next to the teachers desk in the classrooms. Students switch off their phones before depositing them each morning. Teachers then use a digital lock to secure the locker, preventing access to the devices for the school day. As expected, the move initially drew resistance from students when it was announced at the start of Term 2 in 2023, Ms Chia said. There was a huge groan from the students when we announced it, but they understood the why, she said, adding that the school educated students about phone addiction and its harmful effects. Teachers have since observed greater focus during lessons and spent less time on classroom management, while social interaction among students has also improved. In early 2023, if you go to the canteen, you will see everybodys head down, eyes on their devices. Now... everyone is chatting, talking about their day, said Ms Chia. More groups of students also play sports on school grounds. The school has also seen a drop in disciplinary cases, such as students gathering in toilets to smoke or plan mischief. They couldnt coordinate any more because there were no phones, she said. Attempts to bypass the system, such as submitting dummy phones or claiming not to have brought a device, were more common in the first year but have since declined. Several schools have approached Springfield to learn from its experience. Some have even visited the school to view the lockers and see how they work. While Ms Chia said each school needs to consider its own context, she described the initiative as beneficial for Springfield, where the lockers are now known as handphone hotels. She tells the students this: Your phones have worked very hard, so they deserve a vacation while youre in school.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/more-spore-schools-install-handphone-lockers-for-students-to-keep-away-their-phones
"Taxidermied polar bear, shark bones among wildlife imports approved by Singapore in 2024","Jan 10, 2026, 03:00 PM","Jan 10, 2026, 08:52 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/9b5ca5151f5d5729d8fa24a8ddf5b8b733e424089a1418d103acc55bea836c17,"Wild polar bears can be found in five countries in the Arctic, including Canada and Russia.PHOTO: AFP","['Wildlife conservation', 'Wildlife', 'National Parks Board', 'Animals', 'Plants']","SINGAPORE – The Republic in 2024 approved the import of a taxidermied specimen of a wild polar bear from Greenland for personal reasons, The Straits Times has learnt. It was one of the more unusual wildlife items imported into the country for personal reasons that year, according to ST checks on data published by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The last time a wild polar bear was imported into Singapore for personal reasons was in 2012, according to the CITES trade data. Other items imported into Singapore for personal reasons in 2024 included some live cacti and their seeds, bones of the endangered winghead shark and garments from wild vicuna, which was once considered endangered. Native to South America, vicunas are the smallest members of the camel family and are a relative of llamas and alpacas. Vicuna wool is considered one of the most expensive and is highly sought after in the fashion industry, while shark bones are used to make decorative items. CITES is an agreement between governments that aims to ensure wildlife species are not threatened with extinction due to international trade. The convention regulates the international trade of CITES-listed live animals and plants, including their parts and products, by requiring permits to be obtained before consignments are allowed to leave or enter a country. This requirement applies to both businesses and individuals. Singapore has been a signatory to CITES since 1986. The National Parks Board (NParks) is the national authority responsible for the implementation and enforcement of CITES for Singapore. As part of the permitting system, those who want to import or export parts and products of wildlife species listed on CITES must indicate the purpose of doing so, such as if it is for personal reasons or for commercial, educational, medical and scientific reasons. These records are publicly available on the CITES trade database, which is updated on an ongoing basis. The database noted that the polar bear import approved in 2024 was sourced from the wild in Greenland, and was imported into Singapore from Britain. CITES classifies fauna and flora according to three categories, or appendices, based on how threatened the species are. Wildlife listed on Appendix I are considered the most threatened with extinction. Species listed on this appendix are offered the highest level of protection as international trade in them is generally prohibited, except for cases such as for non-commercial purposes like scientific research. Species in this category include the Asian arowana and Sunda pangolin. Species listed in Appendix II are those that are not necessarily threatened with extinction now, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled. The import of species under Appendix II is permitted with an export or re-exporting permit from the exporting or re-exporting country. This means that international trade of such species is regulated, but not prohibited. The polar bear falls under Appendix II. Appendix III lists species included at the request of a country party to CITES that already regulates the trade in the species, and needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation. Species under Appendix III include the wild water buffalo and the Bengal fox. In response to queries from ST, NParks senior director for wildlife trade Anna Wong said that the polar bear import in 2024 was approved as necessary conditions were met. These include the verification of the re-export CITES permit from Britain issued by the CITES management authority there, she said. She added: In addition to the re-export CITES permit, a taxidermy certificate and trophy/health certificate had been obtained to certify that the specimen had been treated and was free from diseases before it was allowed entry into Singapore. Polar bear biologist Andrew Derocher from the University of Alberta in Canada, who has studied the arctic mammal for more than 40 years, said that he has no concerns about the international trade in polar bears that is conducted within the context of CITES. Wild polar bears can be found in five countries in the Arctic, including Canada and Russia. He added: There is a legal harvest of polar bears in Greenland and the Greenlandic government has a process for monitoring populations to ensure that the harvest is sustainable. Professor Derocher said the harvest of polar bears is not viewed as a significant threat to the species in the Greenland polar bear populations. However, he said there are some concerns within Canada that harvesting polar bears may not be sustainable due to developments caused by climate change and subsequent population declines. The main threat to the long-term persistence of polar bears is climate change, he said. There will likely be interactions between climate change and sustainable harvest levels for polar bears as arctic warming continues, but this is a developing issue over the coming decades and determined on a population-specific level associated with how fast sea ice conditions are changing, he added. As for the wild vicunas, which are found in various countries including Argentina and Peru, Dr Wong noted that commercial trade in certain populations is allowed under CITES. In particular, vicuna populations listed on Appendix II include certain populations in Argentina and Chile, and the entire populations of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. All other populations of vicuna are listed on Appendix I, where commercial trade is prohibited. The vicuna items allowed into Singapore were listed on the CITES database as being imported from Argentina, Bolivia and Peru via Italy. Species that are traded internationally without the required permits are considered to fall under the illegal wildlife trade. Dr Wong said Singapore is committed to stamping out the illegal wildlife trade by adopting a zero-tolerance stance on the illegal trade of endangered wildlife species, as well as their parts and derivatives. She added: Agencies in Singapore collaborate closely in a multi-pronged, whole-of-government approach, which includes working with international and local partners to maintain vigilance in regulating and enforcing against illegal wildlife trade. For instance, Singapore foiled an attempt to smuggle $1.13 million worth of rhinoceros horns, which fall under Appendix I, in arecord haul in November 2025.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/taxidermied-polar-bear-shark-bones-among-wildlife-imports-approved-in-singapore-in-2024

Wandong Fire Brigade/Handout via REUTERS","['Television', 'Forest', 'Fires']","SYDNEY, Jan 11 - Australian authorities said on Sunday it would take firefighters weeks to get on top of bushfires in the countrys southeast that have razed homes, cut power to thousands of homes and burned swathes of bushland. The blazes have torn through more than 300,000 hectares (741,316 acres) of bushland in Victoria state since the middle of the week, destroying more than 130 properties, including homes, and leaving thousands without power. There were more than 30 fires burning in Victoria on Sunday morning, Premier Jacinta Allan said. In neighbouring New South Wales state, several fires close to the Victorian border were burning at emergency level, the highest danger rating, the states Rural Fire Service said. Authorities have said the fires are the worst to hit the southeast since the Black Summer blazes of 2019-2020 that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. Chief Fire Officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria, Chris Hardman, said it would likely take firefighters weeks to get the upper hand on the fires. These fires will not be contained before it gets hot, dry and windy again, Hardman told Australian Broadcasting Corporation television. Allan said on social media platform X that a total fire ban was in place for Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battled the blazes. Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne, she added. One of the largest fires, near the town of Longwood, about 112 km (70 miles) north of Melbourne, has burned 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) of bushland, destroying 30 structures, vineyards and agricultural land. My thoughts are with Australians in these regional communities at this very difficult time, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in televised remarks on Saturday.

Bangladesh said its national security adviser, Khalilur Rahman, met U.S. diplomats Allison Hooker and Paul Kapur in Washington. Rahman expressed Bangladeshs interest in principle to be part of the international stabilization force that would be deployed in Gaza, a Bangladeshi government statement added. It did not mention the extent or nature of its proposed involvement. The State Department had no immediate comment. A U.N. Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November, authorized a so-called Board of Peace and countries working with it to establish a temporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza where a ceasefire began in October. The truce has not progressed beyond its first phase, and little progress has been made on the next steps. More than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect, and nearly all of Gazas more than 2 million people live in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in a sliver of territory where Israeli troops have withdrawn and Hamas has reasserted control. Both Israel and Hamas remain far apart on the more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase of the ceasefire and have accused each other of violations. Israels military assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gazas entire population. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel called its actions self-defense after a 2023 Hamas attack in which 1,200 were killed and over 250 taken hostage.

AKPS said, besides NIIse, foreigners could also use the manual counters to clear immigration. AKPS, in a statement on Facebook, said that the e-gates at the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex (BSI) were experiencing technical problems involving those holding foreign passports. However, Malaysians can use the system without any issues. AKPS said that at press time, the movement of people at all zones was smooth, and the Immigration Department and AKPS were carrying out monitoring and rectifying works. Tens of thousands of foreigners were reported earlier to be stuck in long queues at Malaysias two land checkpoints with Singapore following a major technical glitch which knocked out most of the immigration autogates on Jan 10. The worst affected is the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex (BSI), where foreigners have been forced to wait up to two hours to clear immigration. It was learnt that at least 39 autogates at the entry and 29 machines at the exit areas of the bus halls at BSI had experienced problems for a few days, but the system crashed totally on Jan 10 due to the huge influx of foreigners during the weekend. The Sultan Abu Bakar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex (KSAB) has 12 autogates. Malaysians using their local passports are still able to use the autogates, while the system for motorcycles and cars was also functioning properly. Even the autogates at the KTM (Keretapi Tanah Melayu) train station at BSI were knocked offline, a security official said, adding that efforts were being made to restore the system in stages. This is the first major disruption this year, and the timing is bad, especially when we are getting a lot of foreign visitors in conjunction withVisit Malaysiaand Visit Johor 2026, the official said. The official added that the Malaysian Border Control and Protection Agency (AKPS) has been directed to open up all the manual counters to handle the influx of people. The official said that so far, the situation at KSAB was still manageable. Facebook user Joy Ce said that it took about three hours to get her passport stamped. In July 2025,a similar incidenthappened, with a breakdown in autogates in major checkpoints around the country affecting more than 380,000 foreigners. At press time, AKPS was in the midst of issuing an official notification about the disruption to urge visitors to be prepared for delays. Since June 1, 2024, visitors from 63 countries, as well as diplomats serving in Malaysia and their family members, have been eligible to use the autogates for faster clearance.

REUTERS/Aaron Schwartz/File Photo","['Venezuela', 'World Bank', 'IMF']","SAVAGE, Minnesota, Jan 10 - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Reuters that additional U.S. sanctions on Venezuela could be lifted as soon as next week to facilitate oil sales, and that he will also meet next week with the heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on their re-engagement with Venezuela. Bessent said in an interview late on Friday that almost $5 billion worth of Venezuelas currently frozen IMF Special Drawing Rights monetary assets could be deployed to help rebuild the countrys economy. Were de-sanctioning the oil thats going to be sold, Bessent said during a visit to a Winnebago Industries engineering facility. The Treasury was examining changes that would facilitate the repatriation of sale proceeds of the oil stored largely on ships back to Venezuela. How can we help that get back into Venezuela, to run the government, run the security services and get it to the Venezuelan people? he said of the Treasurys sanctions analysis. Asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Bessent said, It could be as soon as next week, but did not identify which ones. The moves are part of the Trump administrations effort to stabilize Venezuela and encourage the return of U.S. oil producers to the country a week after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in Caracas and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges. U.S. sanctions have banned international banks and other creditors from engaging with the Venezuelan government without a license. The institutions have cited this as an impediment to a complex $150 billion debt restructuring widely viewed as a key to the return of private capital to Venezuela. On Friday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking courts or creditors from impounding Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts, declaring that these funds should be safeguarded to help Venezuela create peace, prosperity and stability. IMF, WORLD BANK RE-ENGAGEMENT Bessent, who controls the dominant U.S. shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said that the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela. The Treasury chief said that the U.S. Treasury would be willing to convert Venezuelas IMF Special Drawing Rights held at the Fund to dollars for use in rebuilding Venezuela. Venezuela currently has about 3.59 billion SDRs, which are worth about $4.9 billion at Fridays exchange rate, but it cannot currently access them. SDRs are made up of dollars, euros, yen, sterling and Chinese yuan. The Treasury last year agreed to back a $20 billion swap line for Argentina partly with that South American countrys SDRs in an effort to stabilize the peso and help Argentine President Javier Mileis party win in parliamentary elections. An IMF spokesperson said that the Fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined comment on Bessents mention of a meeting next week. The IMF has not engaged with Venezuela for more than two decades, with the last formal IMF assessment of Venezuelas economy completed in 2004. Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduros predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez declared that Venezuela will no longer have to go to Washington for funding. A source familiar with the World Banks internal discussions on Venezuela said that the development lender was in the early stages of exploring how it could be helpful to Venezuela, noting that the bank moved in quickly with assistance to Afghanistan and Syria after regime changes and provided early support to Gaza and Ukraine. FAST MOVERS Bessent said that he believed that smaller, privately held companies would move swiftly back into Venezuelas oil sector, despite reluctance voiced by some oil majors including Exxon Mobil, whose past Venezuelan assets were nationalized twice. I think its going to be the typical progression where the private companies can move quickly and will come in very quickly. They havent talked about financing at all, Bessent said. Chevron has been there a long time and will continue to be there, so I believe that their commitment will greatly increase. Bessent added that he believed there was a role for the U.S. Export-Import Bank in guaranteeing financing for Venezuelas oil sector, echoing previous comments from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Washington said a lone gunman from the militant group carried outthe Dec 13 attackin Palmyra - home to UNESCO-listed ancient ruins and once controlled by militant fighters - that killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter. The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria and were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra, US Central Command said in a statement on X, using an acronym for the group, which is known as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The US and Jordan carried outa previous round of strikesas part of the same operation in December, hitting dozens of ISIS targets. The Palmyra attack was the first such incident sincethe overthrow of Syrias longtime rulerBashar al-Assad in December 2024. The US personnel who were targeted were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the international effort to combat ISIS, which seized swathes of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014. The militants were ultimately defeated by local ground forces backed by international air strikes and other support, but ISIS still has a presence in Syria, especially in the countrys vast desert. US President Donald Trump has long been sceptical of Washingtons presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country. The Pentagon announced in April that the United States would halve the number of US personnel in Syria in the following months, while US envoy for Syria Tom Barrack said in June that Washington would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.

The move comes as Venezuela, also under U.S. pressure, begins releasing political prisoners. The development in Nicaragua reflects the degree of pressure that some left-wing governments in Latin America are under to appease U.S. demands, especially following last weeks stunning capture by U.S. special forces of Venezuelas president, Nicolas Maduro, who faces U.S. federal charges of narco-terrorism and drug trafficking. Maduro has said he was kidnapped. In a statement, the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced the inmates release without confirming the exact number of people freed or whether they had been detained for political reasons. Its unclear whether those released will be restricted to house arrest. A human rights NGO that tracks political prisoners in Nicaragua identified 19 people released on Saturday. Opposition leader and former prisoner Ana Margarita Vijil, head of the UNAMOS political movement, told Reuters that those released are political prisoners, and several of them are our friends. Vijil said she did not know the number of those involved but said they include former mayor Oscar Gadea and Evangelical pastor Rudy Palacios along with four of his relatives. Palacios was detained in July after criticizing the government for human rights violations. He had also supported demonstrators who took to the streets in 2018 to demand Ortegas ouster. Ortega responded to the protests with repression that left at least 350 dead and hundreds detained. He and his wife, Rosario Murillo, control virtually every aspect of the government, including the armed forces and the judiciary. On Friday, the U.S. embassy in Nicaragua praised the release of opposition figures in Venezuela and called on Ortegas government to follow in their steps. In Nicaragua, more than 60 people remain unjustly detained or missing, including pastors, religious workers, the sick, and the elderly. Peace is only possible with freedom!, the embassy tweeted. Liberales Nicaragua, a coalition of opposition groups, praised the inmates release in a statement. We have no doubt that such a decision is the result of political pressure exerted by the U.S. government on the dictatorship and of the political chess moves triggered by events in Venezuela.

Mr Jacques Moretti, co-owner of the Constellation bar in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana wastaken into custodyon Jan 9, as prosecutors investigate the tragedy. Most ofthe 40 people who diedwere teenagers, and another 116 people were injured. Mr Moretti told the Vallais public prosecutors office that he had found out about the locked door just after the deadly fire. When he arrived at the scene, he forced open the door, according to excerpts from police reports published by several French and Swiss media outlets confirmed to AFP by a source close to the case. Mr Moretti said he had found several people lying behind the door after opening it. Initial findings suggest that the fire wascaused by sparklerscoming into contact with soundproofing foam installed on the ceiling of the establishments basement. Questions are also being raised regarding the presence and accessibility of fire extinguishers, and whether the bars exits were in compliance with regulations. We always add a sparkler candle when we serve a bottle of wine in the dining room, said his wife and co-owner, Jessica, who was released after the Jan 9 hearing. Mr Moretti told investigators that he had carried out tests and the candles were not powerful enough to ignite the acoustic foam. Mr Moretti said he bought the foam in a DIY store and installed it himself during renovations carried out after buying the establishment in 2015. Regarding the presence of numerous underage young people in the bar at the time of the tragedy, Mr Moretti said the establishment prohibited anyone under the age of 16 and that customers aged 16 to 18 had to be accompanied by an adult. He said he had given these instructions to the security staff, but acknowledged that it is possible that there was a lapse in protocol.

Mr Frey, a Democrat, cautioned them as civil liberties and migrant-rights groups prepared nationwide rallies to protestthe killing of 37-year-old Renee Goodby an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan 7. Minnesota and US officials have offered starkly different accounts of the shooting. Twenty-nine people were arrested overnight in Minneapolis as police responded to protests, including a gathering of demonstrators outside a hotel believed to be lodging a visiting contingent of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, city police chief Brian OHara said. One police officer was injured in the response, Mr OHara told a news conference on Jan 10. Mr Frey, who has been critical of immigration agents and the shooting, said the demonstrations to date have remained mostly peaceful and that anyone causing damage to property or engaging in other unlawful activity would be arrested by the police. We will not counter Donald Trumps chaos with our own brand of chaos. He wants us to take the bait, Mr Frey said at the news conference. The fatal shooting of Ms Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICEs parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the largest DHS operation ever. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a reckless example of governance by reality TV. Mr OHara said more than 200 law enforcement officers were dispatched to the Hilton Canopy Hotel on the night of Jan 9 to respond to what started as a noise protest but then escalated, with more 1,000 demonstrators gathered on site. We initiated a plan and took our time to de-escalate the situation, issued multiple warnings, declaring an unlawful assembly, and ultimately then began to move in and disperse the crowd, Mr OHara said on Jan 10. Federal-state tensions escalated further on Jan 8 when a US Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. Using language similar to its description of the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to weaponise his vehicle and run over agents. The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other US cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner ICE Out For Good planned for Jan 10 and 11. Protest organisers said more than 1,000 weekend events have been planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of ICE agents, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians. The rallies were being organised by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of No Kings protests against Mr Trump in 2025.

They said they had arrested two people, one for aggravated trespass and assault on an emergency worker and one for aggravated trespass and they were seeking another another individual for trespass. Iran has been roiled since Dec 28 by street protests, which have since taken hold nationwide. Initially triggered by a devaluation of the countrys currency and growing concerns over the cost of living, they have since spiralled into mass demonstrations calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. Iranian authorities have cut off internet access in the country, and NGOs and monitoring organisations say they fear that blackout will be used to crack down on the protesters.

The emergency order said the revenue, held in foreign government deposit funds, should be used in Venezuela to help create peace, prosperity and stability. The order was signed on Jan 9, less than a week afterUS forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduroin Caracas. Several companies have longstanding claims against the country. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, for example, left Venezuela nearly 20 years ago after their assets were nationalized. Both are still owed billions of dollars. The order does not mention any specific company. It declares that the money is the sovereign property of Venezuela held in US custody for governmental and diplomatic purposes and is not subject to private claims. President Trump is preventing the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue that could undermine critical US efforts to ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela, the White House said in a fact sheet. A US agreement with Venezuelas interim leaders would provide up to the US, where numerous refineries are specially equipped to refine it. Mr Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the 1976 National Emergencies Act as a legal justification. Mr Trump signed the order the same day he met in Washington with executives from Exxon, Conoco, Chevron and other oil companies as part of a bid to encourage them to invest US$100 billion (S$128 billion) in Venezuelas oil industry.

Forum: Ensuring accessible and fair resolution of workplace discrimination,"Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 09, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Ministry of Manpower', 'Employers']","We refer to the commentary Taking employers to task over discrimination: How easy is the legal process? (Dec 29) by Ms Sugidha Nithiananthan and Ms Caitlin C. Fernandez, and Ms Mizue SaucosForum letter, Improve access to justice at the Employment Claims Tribunal (Jan 6). The Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Act provides a structured avenue for redress starting with direct engagement between parties. If resolution fails, mandatory mediation follows before a case can proceed to adjudication. This tiered approach emphasises amicable outcomes to preserve workplace harmony. The Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) offers a simplified and guided process that is accessible, affordable, and expeditious with safeguards against frivolous claims. The Acts framework does not permit legal representation at the ECT; however, workers and employers may seek legal advice outside proceedings or assistance through their respective unions. Judges in ECT proceedings proactively identify relevant issues and see that pertinent evidence is presented. To assist litigants who may not be legally trained, registrars will provide procedural guidance. As Ms Sauco notes, self-presented parties may apply for family members or friends to provide non-legal support during hearings, via the Community Courts and Tribunals Friend Scheme. More details are available on theSG Courts website (self-help guides). The decisions of the ECT – as courts of law – must be grounded in evidence where parties must prove their case. These procedural rules are essential to ensure that credible evidence is presented and that employers and workers are treated equally. The ECT ensures due process through a rigorous procedure and has maintained a consistent pace in doing so. While the duration between the filing of the claim and the first case management conference varies, most cases continue to be concluded within six months, notwithstanding a 67 per cent increase in claims between 2021 and 2025. The judiciary continues to refine its processes to remain user-centric and accessible, including modernising digital platforms for audio and video evidence submission. Workplace discrimination cases can be complex, and public awareness and education are key. The Ministry of Manpower and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices are stepping up public outreach and education efforts, including the development of a handbook to provide clear and practical guidance to help employers and workers understand and apply the law in the workplace.

He astutely observed that the zone has moved beyond concept to meaningfully capture investor attention, serving as a litmus test for ASEANs ability to build resilient, border-transcending growth. Indeed, the JS-SEZ has evolved into a major regional priority, attracting significant investment. It represents a modern economic model, moving beyond cheap labour to prioritise proximity, resilience and sustainability. The complementary strengths of Singapores global connectivity and Johors land and manufacturing base create a powerful formula for supply-chain security, allowing companies to withstand global shocks. But as Mr Dujacquier noted, the real test lies in execution, not ambition. Physical bridges like the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link are crucial, but the bureaucratic bridge of regulatory alignment is paramount. The formidable challenge is not infrastructure, but harmonising rules and processes. History shows incentives alone cannot compensate for weak fundamentals. To succeed in the long term, the JS-SEZ must adopt transformative measures. There needs to be a joint statutory authority with the power to fast-track approvals, and a regulatory sandbox for innovation. A digital-first border with seamless biometric clearance and shared platforms must be built, making the crossing feel invisible and turning pilot schemes into reality. Critically, success depends on people. A shared skills and innovation corridor is essential to prepare the workforce for the 400,000 high-income jobs that the JS-SEZ is aiming to create. A future skills fund can ensure inclusive growth by upskilling locals, mitigating social risks like housing affordability. Furthermore, investment incentives should be tied to tangible outcomes like high-quality job creation, and not just be blanket tax holidays. The ultimate measure of success will not be short-term factory counts, but whether in 15 years, the border feels like a seam within a single, fluid and globally competitive ecosystem.

The private sale of a high-grade copy of Action Comics No. 1 was announced on Jan 9. Fewer than 100 copies are known to exist, said Mr Vincent Zurzolo, president of Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect, which negotiated the sale. The sale price makes the issue one of themost expensive comics ever sold. The auction record remains with Superman No. 1, from 1939, which sold for US$9.12 million in November. This is the advent of the golden age of comics, and Action Comics No. 1 is the holy grail of holy grails, Mr Zurzolo said in an interview.Action Comics No. 1 is widely considered to be the first American comic book to include superheroes and contributed to a rapid increase in the genres popularity in the mid-20th century. Both the buyer and seller asked to remain anonymous. The history of this particular copy, which originally sold for 10 cents, is a saga of its own. In 1996, Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage purchased it from Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect for US$150,000, Mr Zurzolo said. In 2000, the comic was stolen from Cages home during a party and remained missing until 2011, when it was discovered in a storage unit in California, Mr Zurzolo said. During the 11 years it was missing, the issue skyrocketed in value, Mr Stephen Fishler, chief executive officer of Metropolis and ComicConnect, said in a news release. The comic was returned to Cage, who sold it for US$2.2 million at auction. If this wasnt stolen, it would have been sold with the rest of his collection much earlier and would have sold for far less, Mr Zurzolo said. In essence, because of the theft and recovery, Nicks windfall on this comic book was enormous. The Certified Guaranty Co., which specialises in authenticating and grading collectibles, gave the issue a grade of 9.0, meaning the comic is well-preserved but has minor defects. It joins several other comics that have fetched multi-million-dollar prices at auction and in private sales. At least eight copies of Action Comics No. 1 have now sold for more than US$1 million, according to the CGC.

RIP fine dining in Singapore? Not so fast,"Jan 10, 2026, 02:15 PM","Jan 10, 2026, 02:15 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a981888db120bb658abf37dd95a008c2bfb280eca71c7794a51a8427f709a2ac,"(From left) Chef Sebastien Lepinoy of Les Amis in its newly renovated kitchen, Chef Julien Royer of Odette, which reopened recently after extensive renovations.ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG, ODETTE","['Food and drink', 'Fine dining', 'Singapore Michelin Guide', 'Chefs', 'Restaurants/Eateries']","SINGAPORE – Looking at theemaciated list of one-Michelin-starred restaurants in Singapore, it is tempting to sound the death knell for fine dining. These are restaurants most people cannot dine at often because the meals do not run cheap. When they do dine at one of these establishments, they sit through hours-long, multi-course meals that are at odds with the way people like to eat these days. This scenario is played out across the world – in China, the United States and Europe. The South China Morning Post reports that Chinas fine-dining scene has taken a hit, with diners holding back amid economic uncertainties. Multinational finance and business news website Business Insider reported in 2025 that fine-dining restaurants in the US have been hit by skyrocketing costs, labour shortages and potential tariffs. Chefs and owners there, like the ones here, are countering the headwinds by injecting fun into meals, changing concepts and working to seek new groups of diners. Chefs and restaurateurs in Britain have been hit by the same problems, with the BBC reporting on the spate of Michelin-starred restaurant closures there. Despite the doom and gloom, chefs and owners of fine-dining restaurants here say they are holding their own. Some havefurther invested in their restaurants. Three-Michelin-starred Odette at the National Gallery Singapore recently reopened after extensive renovations that took three months and cost about $2 million. In 2025, Les Amis at Shaw Centre, also with three stars, overhauled its kitchen to the tune of $2 million. That was just part of ongoing renewal and refurbishment works to the restaurant, which celebrates its 32nd birthday in 2026. And yet, 2024 and 2025 had seen a slew of one-Michelin-starred restaurant closures. In 2024, the Singapore Michelin Guide listed 42 one-starred restaurants. When the 2025 guide launched, the number was 32. Now, with more closures, it has dropped to 29. Did Singapore have too many Michelin-starred restaurants? The guide now lists 39 starred establishments. Mr Benedict Lee, 37, a culinary and catering management lecturer at Temasek Polytechnics School of Business, says: The data points to a dining scene that remains prestigious, but is undergoing market correction. He puts the closures in a larger context. Increasing labour costs add to the challenging operating environment restaurant owners have to navigate. Changes in consumer behaviour post-pandemic have worked to reduce the frequency of high-ticket dining. He says: Younger diners, in particular, seem to associate special occasions less with formal multi-course meals and more with convivial settings that emphasise comfort, flexibility and shared experiences. Another trend, he adds, is the availability of premium ingredients in stores and online. Consumers today can easily access products that were once the domain of high-end restaurants, he says. Some examples he cites are live Tsarskaya oysters from France that were sold at FairPrice Finest supermarkets during the festive season, and high-end beef such as Spains Rubia Gallega and Japans Miyazaki A5 wagyu, sold at butcher shops and by online suppliers. This availability means diners who enjoy hosting can recreate elements of a fine-dining experience at home, which reduces the exclusivity that restaurants once held, he says. Chef Julien Royer, 43, of Odette says: These closures are very unfortunate. It shows there are not enough guests in Singapore for so many great restaurants because there are great restaurants. But tourism figures are up. I think people are interested in visiting Singapore again. We have noticed a whole new wave of diners from China, Indonesia and Europe in the past six months to a year. So, you can feel something is changing. Chef Zor Tan, 39, of one-Michelin-starred Born, says: We definitely have a wide variety of concepts here, and competition in the fine-dining space is very strong – and still growing. But I see that as healthy. It pushes all of us to refine our ideas, improve our standards and be clearer about our identity. His 39-seat restaurant opened in 2022 in the historic Jinrikisha Station in Tanjong Pagar. While many of the chefs interviewed hedged on the question of whether there are too many starred establishments in Singapore, chef Sebastien Lepinoy, 52, of Les Amis offers a contrarian view. The French chef, who worked with legendary chef Joel Robuchon and headed Cepage in Hong Kong before coming here to head Les Amis in 2013, says he cannot help but compare the restaurant scene here with the one in Hong Kong. He says both cities have roughly the same population and well-travelled people. Hong Kong has 74 Michelin-starred restaurants, compared with 39 in Singapore. He feels there are not enough three-Michelin-starred establishments here. He says: In Hong Kong, they have three-star Italian restaurants, three-star Chinese restaurants. Three-star Japanese restaurants. We miss this diversity in Singapore. We have two French restaurants, one Nordic one. Many of the chefs interviewed say the surfeit of restaurants is not the problem. The real problem is sameness. Chef Mirko Febbrile, 33, of Somma, says: If many restaurants are doing the same thing, then, yes, the market feels crowded. But if each has a distinct voice, then diversity strengthens the scene. So, the issue isnt too many, its too similar. Competition is only a problem when originality is missing. The 39-seat fine-dining restaurant opened in 2024 at lifestyle enclave New Bahru. In the last two years, he says, costs have increased, expectations have stayed high and diners have been more cautious. Weve remained resilient by being very clear about who we are and what we stand for, he says. Rather than chasing volume, we focused on consistency, integrity and building trust with our guests. The result isnt explosive growth, but stability and a deeper relationship with our guests. Like him, chef Lepinoy thinks identity is key to success. He says the three three-Michelin-starred restaurants here have distinct identities: classic French, contemporary French and Nordic. He says: Many restaurants in Singapore do not have a strong identity. There are some restaurants you may like. But how do you recommend them to your friends? How do you explain what kind of restaurants they are, what cuisine they serve? When you come to Les Amis, you know what you will get. You will get the bread, the butter, sauces with cream. Im not saying this is good or not good. Im saying the identity is very clear. Restaurants that do not differentiate themselves might be doomed. Ms Chai Karim, 29, of Gaia Lifestyle Group, which runs the newly opened Loca Niru – where Japanese chef Shusuke Kubota crafts meals with ingredients sourced from Japan and Asia – says: Singapores fine-dining scene is moving beyond technical excellence towards more holistic experiences. Diners today want a sense of purpose: a story behind the food, the space and the people. That could mean heritage, sustainability or cultural dialogue on the plate. I think the future belongs to restaurants that balance authenticity with innovation, while staying grounded in fundamentals like flavour, warmth and genuine hospitality. Of course, these chefs and owners have a vested interest in keeping the fine-dining scene alive, but there are arguments for having a thriving fine-dining scene. That Singapore needs one is clear to chef Louis Han, 36, of one-starred Nae:um. He says: It would be great if every city has a fine-dining scene. For Singapore especially, it is a regional hub, a multicultural, metropolitan city with a high standard of living and easy access to premium ingredients from all over the world. A dynamic fine-dining scene is a good match to the pulse of the city. Chef Kevin Wong, 32, of one-starred Seroja, which serves food inspired by the Malay Archipelago, likens haute cuisine to haute couture. He says: The different layers of dining experiences we have in Singapore create a city that is vibrant and energetic. Every type of dining is essential, and this is what makes Singapore so attractive. Not every country has a hawker culture. Our hawker culture is amazing. But having a range of different experiences creates diversity for locals and tourists. Executive chef Martin Ofner, 31, of three-Michelin-starred Zen, adds: Just look towards Scandinavia. A strong fine-dining scene sets the ceiling for an entire food culture. It raises standards, attracts international talent and creates an environment where young cooks can learn discipline, structure and excellence. The good part is, those skills dont always stay in fine dining. They eventually filter into casual restaurants, bakeries and new concepts across the city, benefiting society and the culinary landscape as a whole. Chef Mano Thevar, 36, of two-Michelin-starred modern Indian restaurant Thevar, says the Government can continue to promote home-grown culinary talents, support initiatives that promote the rich food culture here and showcase the diversity in the restaurant scene to draw visitors and locals. Temasek Polys Mr Lee thinks a credible fine-dining ecosystem is strategically important for Singapore. He says: At the branding level, having Michelin-starred restaurants and a globally recognised guide positions us alongside major restaurant cities, and supports Singapores pitch as a regional business and lifestyle hub, which in turn feeds into tourism revenue. Like chef Ofner, Mr Lee believes these kitchens function as high-intensity training grounds. So, while fine dining may only ever serve a small slice of diners directly, it punches far above its weight in shaping skills, standards and Singapores international reputation as a serious food city, he says. On his part, Borns chef Tan is focusing on what has worked for him. He says: In 2026, I want to stay curious and stay honest. My focus is on consistency, the guests journey and storytelling. If diners feel something when they eat – a memory, a sense of place, an emotion – theyll keep coming back. Odette is marking its 10th anniversary in a big way. The 40-seat restaurant at the National Gallery Singapore reopened with a new look after closing for three months in 2025 for renovations, and there are collaborations with big-name chefs coming up. Chef Royer says: I think 10 years is a good mark of maturity, and the restaurant has, touch wood, been doing really well in the last 10 years. I thought it was a good point for us to improve the facilities for our guests and for ourselves, and take a pause to reflect on that milestone. Ive been taught by great people in the industry that even after 10 years, a restaurant needs to keep growing. So, either you rest on your laurels or you take a risk and invest for the future. We believe that this refresh is a necessary step to deepen our commitment to a more intentional and honest approach to fine dining. The renovations, he estimates, cost about $2 million. Odettes original pastel interior has been replaced by warm neutrals, the work of Singapore-born Sacha Leong of London- and Sydney-based design studio Nice Projects. He had created the restaurants original interiors. New lighting, chairs upholstered in mohair velvet and marquetry panels lend the restaurant a grown-up, sophisticated look. At the entrance is a paper sculpture by Singaporean visual artist Dawn Ng, the colours inspired by ingredients. The kitchen has also been overhauled. The new countertops are 95cm tall, 10cm higher than before, to make them more comfortable for the team. There is also a new exhaust system and more space to work in. Odette offers a five-course lunch menu priced at $368 a person, and a seven-course menu at lunch and dinner at $468 a person. The food has also evolved, chef Royer says. When we first opened, what we were cooking was French, very French, he adds. Now, I believe that the DNA is French, because thats the way I was trained, but the cuisine is a lot more infused with Asia. So, I like to say we are influenced by Asian sensibilities, Asian finesse. It comes from his having been here for more than a decade, travelling and dining in the region and eating with his team. He says: I think of people as an influence on the way you cook. Thats the beautiful story of and the language of cuisine. I cannot cook the same food in Paris, Melbourne, New York and Singapore. The sense of place is very important. On the menu, the Crab Contrast course features Norwegian king crab leg slow-cooked and served with tarragon oil bearnaise sauce, with a chilli crab mantou on the side. The main course, Aged Duck Voyage & Tradition, uses Cherry Valley duck from Perak. It is brined, glazed with maltose, air-dried and then dry-aged for two weeks, and served with quince, parsnip puree, tardivo radicchio and a pomme souffle. Served on the side is a bowl of Koshihikari rice with duck leg confit and gizzard from the bird. Chef Royer says the team had tried out six different types of duck before finding one that yielded tender meat and, more crucially, crisp skin. That it is available fresh from Malaysia is a bonus, he adds. He is working with new ingredients, and diners might see Hanwoo beef – newly allowed into Singapore from Jeju Island in South Korea – on the menu. Also in the cards, a new veal sweetbreads dish which features corn from Taiwan. He has also been getting morel mushrooms from a supplier in China. I feel like sometimes, as a French chef, it is tempting to use ingredients that Im familiar with and source the best produce from France, he says. But theres a lot to discover in Asia. And in the next 10 years, that is what I want to do. I want to spend more time travelling in Asia, especially China. He will also be collaborating with British chef Daniel Calvert of three-Michelin-starred Sezanne in Tokyo in February; French chef David Toutain of two-Michelin-starred Restaurant David Toutain in Paris in March; and German chef Jan Hartwig of three-Michelin-starred Jan in Munich in October. Meanwhile, chef Royer is also tending to his two other restaurants – Claudine in Harding Road, now in its fifth year, and Louise in Hong Kong, now in its seventh year. He might, he allows, open a casual place with good cocktails and ugly delicious food. All that, and running a three-Michelin-starred restaurant too? I feel very full of energy, he says.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/food/rip-fine-dining-in-singapore-not-so-fast

5 best places to eat on a 48-hour foodie trip to Penang,"Jan 10, 2026, 01:15 PM","Jan 10, 2026, 01:15 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d78b28a190cb26db0887e1b00edd2c605ba0acfac9f37dbb35a2415ed70c0145,"Ravis Claypot Appom Manis is a 100-year-old stall in Pulau Tikus, Penang.ST PHOTO: JUDITH TAN","['ST Weekend Trip', 'Travel and leisure', 'Malaysia', 'Tourism']","PENANG – George Town, the capital of Penang, is renowned for its diverse and delicious hawker food, making it a major draw for Singaporeans who crave good cuisine without having to travel too far or spend too much. On a recent 48-hour trip to Penang, I embark on a food safari around George Town, led by my friends who are familiar with the destination. Some of these recommendations can also be found in the Michelin Guide. These are my top picks. Info:str.sg/pyAC Waking up early and getting to Swee Kong Coffee Shop in Pulau Tikus by 7.30am is well worth it. The 105-year-old coffee shop is packed with local patrons, which usually signals good, authentic and affordable food. Despite the queue, do not miss Ravis Claypot Appom Manis. The 100-year-old stall makes its appom fresh to order. Each appom is cooked in a claypot over charcoal fire, leaving the centre soft and fluffy and the edges golden and crispy. Eat the pancakes hot and they melt in your mouth. My advice: Buy more than the minimum order of five pieces (RM6 or S$1.90). Also best eaten hot is the char kway teow from Hean Char Koay Teow stall. Every plate (RM8) is packed with flat kway teow, fresh prawns, cockles, Chinese chives, Chinese sausage and duck egg – all fried in pork fat with a wok hei flavour. It is no wonder that stallholder Winny Ong was crowned the new champion of char kway teow in Penang in a competition held by local organisations in June 2025. If you prefer a no-frills bowl of Penang-style Hokkien mee (from RM6 for a small bowl), order one from Lean Huat Hock Kean Mee. The bee hoon holds its bite without being soggy. The deep red broth comes topped with chunks of pork, dried prawns and shallots. Outside the coffee shop, a hawker cooks up a storm on a pushcart preparing what Penangites call char koay kak (RM8.50), which resembles black fried carrot cake. It is both savoury and sweet with a gummy texture, which contrasts with the crunchiness of the bean sprouts. Info:str.sg/AdoCP Despite a full breakfast, we head to the famous Ah Boy for its kway teow soup (RM6). The family-run shop specialises in kway teow served dry or in soup. The clear broth is made from chicken and pork bones. A Teochew dish, the soup version is Ah Boys signature and the springy pork tendon balls have a hint of ginger. In addition, we order bean sprouts for a bit of crunch. You can also add chicken slices, fish balls, meat balls, duck meat, innards and eggs for more texture. Info:str.sg/Chcs For a Peranakan home-dining experience, we book dinner at Winns Cafe, located in a private residence. It is a homely, relaxed setting and the Nonya cuisine does not disappoint. Its signature nasi ulam (RM16) reminds me of my great-aunts – rice with a variety of finely chopped herbs and vegetables, toasted grated coconut, dried shrimps andsambal belacan, garnished with finely julienned daun kaduk (betel leaves) and pink torch ginger. The other dish that impresses me is the kerabu kacang botol or winged bean salad (RM19.90), a mix of thinly sliced winged beans, herbs and tangy dressing. The fresh herbs come from the restaurants garden, giving the dish a balance of tangy and spicy flavours. We also order the Kari Kapitan, its signature spicy chicken curry (RM29), which has an old-school rich and savoury taste from coconut milk, aromatic spices and marinated tender chicken chunks; as well as the salted fish curry, which I am told is a quintessential Penang Nonya dish. Prepared using salted fish bones and Indian curry spices, the dish also has a mix of vegetables such as cabbage, long beans, brinjal and taupok. We particularly enjoy the strong aroma of the salted fish. We pay RM650 for seven people. Reservations are recommended and can be made via WhatsApp. Go tostr.sg/kkiL Info:str.sg/K9jE For a late breakfast on our last day, we go for the famous white curry mee. The dish (RM7.50) is known for its rich, milky-white coconut-based broth, a blend of yellow noodles and bee hoon, and savoury toppings like prawns, cockles, cuttlefish and taupok. Spicy sambal adds a kick. Info:str.sg/cenU Penang regulars will likely be familiar with cake shop ChinaHouse, but to avoid the tourist crowds, head instead to Nelys Passion Heart, a cafe off Jalan A.S. Mansoor. Walking by, we are attracted to the aroma wafting from the cafe. It has old-school decor, with an intricate mosaic floor, bright yellow walls and stained-glass windows. The cakes here are made by the self-taught Nely Koon, who regularly innovates her repertoire. Apart from their visual appeal, the cakes also deliver in taste. Order the famous cempedak cake (RM18) or cempedak crumble (RM22), which are both stuffed with chunks of the fresh fruit. Even the simple butter cake uses two different types of butter – an Irish one for richness and a French butter for its fragrance. Everyone agrees that the cheesecakes, which run the gamut of flavours from durian and cempedak to strawberry rose and Oreo, are a highlight. Cake prices range from RM18 to RM22 a slice. Ms Koon even joins our table of seven to delight us with her stories. It is no wonder none of us leaves the cafe empty-handed. We spend about RM2,000 altogether on cakes, jams and slices to celebrate a couple of birthdays that night.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/travel/5-best-places-to-eat-on-a-48-hour-foodie-trip-to-penang

Ms Sharon Poon, co-owner of recently opened roast meat eatery Eat 3 Cuts,worked through about $200,000 in losses across a series of failed ventures before taking the plunge again. Hawker cook Teo Chye Huat, who fries carrot cakeand char kway teow at Hai Nan Zai, kept reporting for work until he collapsed and was diagnosed withstage threeintestinal cancer. For Mr Sam Png and Mrs Jenny Png of Woody Family Peranakan Cafe, keeping the cafe open has become the way to keep a roof over their heads. They share what keeps them going despite the hurdlesthrown their way. Over six years, Ms Sharon Poon has opened and closed several F&B ventures, accumulating about $200,000 in losses, together with her business partner. Yet in September, the 36-year-old roast meat chef launched her latest venture, Eat 3 Cuts at Atrix (FW), this time with a third investor on board. It is her fourth attempt at running an eatery from scratch. Though she has had moments when she wanted to walk away, she found herself picking up the pieces and starting again. Ms Poon graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2012 with a Bachelor of Arts and Social Sciences, and worked as a financial services consultant at a bank for a year before switching to insurance sales from 2013 to 2019. By 30, she felt stagnant and wanted a change. A friend introduced her to a fengshui practitioner who had been a roast meat chef. He became her culinary mentor and later her business partner. Her parents objected strongly to her career change. Her mother, then aged 62, was head of risk at a foreign bank, while her father, aged 69, was a senior engineer in the public service. But in March 2019, Ms Poon bought $3,000 worth of second-hand equipment and rented a stall in an industrial canteen in Bedok North for $800 a month. It served as a test kitchen where she learnt to roast chicken and duck using a charcoal-fired Apollo oven. The daily grind was from 7am to 6pm, but she felt energised by the learning process and brushed off the minor burns and cuts she picked up along the way. Early orders were encouraging and she felt ready to start the business in earnest. In May 2019, she and her mentor opened a 340 sq ft eatery at Burlington Square. They put in a capital of $30,000, with her mentor contributing 30 per cent. Business was slow for the first six months and Ms Poon added another $25,000 to keep it afloat. With no budget to hire, the duo worked round the clock from9 to 2amdaily. Space constraints meant they could start defrosting and preparing the ducks only after closing time each night. Two months into opening, Ms Poon found out she was pregnant with her first child, a boy. At that time, she was engaged to her boyfriend of four years, but had delayed wedding plans to focus on her business. She worked through the morning sickness. When food bloggers featured her stall, she saw a surge in customers for one to two months, but could not cope with the sudden crowd. Running out of roast meat and getting scolded by diners became common occurrences. The unit also suffered plumbing issues and poor ventilation that triggered complaints from neighbouringstalls. She gave birth in January 2020 and returned to work after a week to oversee renovations at a new location. She and her business partner had secured a 680 sq ft second-floor unit at Tai Seng Point. Renovation and exhaust installation cost $50,000, which they split evenly. The shop opened on March 1, 2020. Weeks later, the Covid-19 circuit breaker began. Footfall disappeared and a Covid-19 case involving a singer at a pub in the same building further hurt business. They drew no salary, survived on rental subsidies for four months and disposed up to 10 ducks a day for the first two months, later scaling down to five, then finally switching to pre-orders only. Losses continued, amounting to about $3,000 a month. The problem was our roast duck dishes are more suited for group dining, she says. With Covid restrictions, group dining was not popular. In February 2021, they tried to boost income with a second outlet at Old Airport Road Food Centre. The set-up cost was $2,000, but Ms Poon was pregnant again and struggled with severe morning sickness while managing the stall. In June 2021, she got married and gave birth to her second child, a daughter, in Octoberthat year.The stall lasted nine months before they shut it in November 2021 due to dining restrictions and poor sales. In December 2021, they moved to Arc 380 in Jalan Besar. The 600 sq ft space cost $50,000 to renovate. With Ms Poons savings depleted, her mentor funded the set-up. They installed electrical stoves for noodles and reserved charcoal roasting for ducks. Power bills alone reached $1,800 a month. Some months, they broke even, but most were loss-making. TikTok marketing helped, but minimally. In early 2023, they closed. They did not recover their capital, making additional losses of about $30,000. That closure was the toughest. Ms Poon took a break for six months, when she ruminated and wallowed in guilt for missing out on time with her children. I wondered why others could succeed in F&B while I kept failing, she recalls. She felt she had ignored red flags out of optimism and made mistakes such as settling for locations with low footfall and unreasonable rents. Still, she remained relentless. In November 2023, she, her partner and a third investor started a new concept with $15,000: a Pipa Duck Brioche Burger stall in a coffee shop in Lorong 24 Geylang. But business was weak, the concept did not fit the neighbourhood and branding did not land. It was then that she discovered she was pregnant with her third child, a boy. As her pregnancy progressed, her doctor advised her to avoid the heat and stress of kitchen work. Exhausted from years of losses and weighed down by self-doubt, she closed the stall in April 2024 and gave birth toher sonin Junethat year. My main motivation was to make money while I was young, she says. I wanted to build something for my children. But all I got in return for the effort and time put in was a huge pot of disappointment. But a year later, she took another leap. Her mentor had found a new investor willing to fund a larger venture. With capital of $100,000 – $15,000 each from Ms Poon and her mentor, and $70,000 from the investor – Eat 3 Cuts opened in September 2025 atAtrix (FW), an industrial building near Aljunied MRT station.The 1,300 sq ft space across two levels seats 50 diners. This time, she negotiated the rent down by 30 per cent, determined not to repeat past mistakes. Popular items are the Signature Pipa Duck ($18 for small, $28 for half a duck and $55 for a whole duck). The Pipa Duck, a classic Cantonese dish not easily availablein Singapore, is prepared by butterflying the raw duck, which is marinated with housemade seafood sauce, then charcoal-roasted. Eat 3 Cutsalso serves Poached Chicken ($12 for a quarter, $17 for half and $32 for whole). The Poached Chicken is cooked in a braising liquid prepared witheight types of Chinese herbsand does not contain soya sauce. Old customers from Burlington Square and Arc 380 have begun returning, and early months have been promising. So far, the business has been able to cover most of its monthly operating costs. I am cautiously positive, Ms Poon says. This time, I feel we finally have a fighting chance.

He tried to ignore the stabbing pain at his waist that had been plaguing him formonths. He attempted to cycle to work, as he had done forthe past decade,but the pain was so severe that he could not even mount his bicycle. Still, he tried to push it along towards Chong Pang Market and Food Centre, where he works, some 2km from his home in Yishun Street 22. He barely made headway when he collapsed on the pavement at 3am in agony. He remained slumped there for two hours before a private-hire car took him to Singapore General Hospital. Initialtests suggested a bacterial infection, but an MRI scan revealedstage threeintestinal cancer. He was hospitalised for threemonths,then took another month off work to recuperate. But he refused to quit his job, telling his boss he would be backat worksoon. For Mr Teo, who fries carrot cake and char kway teow at Hai Nan Zai stall, work has always been inseparable from survival. The son of a vegetable seller started working at age 13 to help supplement his familys income. Mr Teo, the sixth of nine children, dropped out of vocational school and took on odd jobs as a shop assistant and construction helper, earning about $200 a month. In his 20s, he saw opportunity in food and beverage work. He spent his free time visiting noodle stalls, striking up friendships with hawkers and observing how they cooked and ran their businesses. Married at 27 and with his wife expecting, pressure mounted to earn more. In 1991, Mr Teo borrowed $10,000 from a moneylender to startanoodle stall at Block 293 Yishun Street 22. Despite having no training, he sold braised noodles, laksa and fishball noodles, adjusting his cooking based on customer feedback. He cleared his debt within three months. Business picked up. He hired four stall assistants, while handling the cooking himself. His day began at 2am, braising meats, preparing stock, slicing fishcake, frying wu xiang and cooking laksa gravy. Customers arrived from 5.30am, and he worked until 2pm. Along the way, he picked up a gambling habit. He estimates he accumulated debts of more than $200,000 over the years he gambled. He lost interest in running the stall andeventuallygave up the business. For about a decade from his early 40s, he drifted between odd jobs and short-lived attempts to reopen stalls. At 51, he decided he needed stability. In 2014, a friend recommended him for a job at Hai Nan Zai.Mr Teo had no experience frying char kway teow, Hokkien mee or carrot cake, and his boss was almost 20 years younger. But he had no qualms starting from scratch. I understand the difficulties of running a business and felt the responsibility to help my new boss and do my best, he says. For a year, he refused to touch the wok, as he felt his stir-frying skills were not up to par. Instead, he took orders, served customers and handled prep work, while watching closely as his boss cooked. He practised during off-peak hours. Char kway teow, he says, is the most challenging. Fire control matters to impart wok hei, portions vary depending on orders, and customers make numerous custom requests that the cook must remember. In 2015, he told his boss he was ready. Today, most customers order his carrot cake ($3.50) in the mornings. Fried kway teow ($4.50) is the second-most popular item. Hai Nan Zai received its first Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2021. Today, Mr Teo reports for work at 3.30am to prepare ingredients and cook prawn stock for Hokkien mee. Frying starts at 5.30am. He works until about 2pm, when other cooks take over. In March 2024, a dull pain erupted at his waist, making it difficult for him to stand or sit. Even putting on his pants was a struggle and getting out of bed took 10 minutes. Over the next nine months, he visited several Chinese physicians but to no avail, relying on painkillers to get through the day. Even as his weight dropped from 80kg to 50kg, it did not occur to him to seek medical help. On Christmas morning that year,his body gave way. He was bedridden for two of his three months in hospital.He underwent 20 rounds of radiotherapy and six rounds of chemotherapy. His brush with cancer surfaced publicly after his son-in-law, Mr Marcus Xu, 37, posted a TikTok video recounting Mr Teos cancer treatment. Mr Xuworks inthe insurance industry. Mr Teos battle with cancer caught the attention of Nee Soon GRC MP K. Shanmugam, who visited him at his stall in November. Mr Shanmugam, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs, later wrote a Facebook post wishing him all the best, and a full and complete recovery. I am just an ordinary person, Mr Teo says. For him to come and show concern, I felt very touched. During his hospital stay, he underwent physiotherapy. It took him a month to walk to the toilet unaided. Hedidstretching and breathing exercises daily during his month of home rest before returning towork. I dont want to stay home and think, says Mr Teo, who is divorced and lives in a rented room.Working makes me feel better. His boss, Mr Jeremy Leo, 43, recalls: When he was hospitalised, we communicated daily on the phone. I was worried about his health, but he always spoke positively and kept telling me he would be back to work soon. Mr Teo has since overhauled his lifestyle. He has cut out beer and soft drinks, and drinks warm water and eats simpler meals. Every morning, he reaches the food centre by 1.30am and exercises nearby for an hour before starting work. After knocking off at 2pm, he eats a light meal, usually fish soup, does weight training at home, skips dinner and is in bed by 5pm to get at least seven hours of sleep. While his doctor has suggested surgery to remove the remaining cancer cells, Mr Teo is still considering his options. For now, he has no plans to stop working. As long as I can move, I will work, he says. Every day I have, I do my best. Hai Nan Zai Where:01-129 Chong Pang Market and Food Centre, Block 105 Yishun Ring RoadOpen:5.30am to 9pm daily When Mr Sam Png and Mrs Jenny Png started Woody Family Peranakan Cafe in 2009, it was their chance at a fresh start. Both divorced and in their 50s then, they tied the knot and pooled $120,000 of their savings to rent a bare-bones unit and build a cafe from scratch. Sixteen years on, they have sunk even the funds meant for their home into their eatery, unwilling to give up, as doing so will render them homeless. They decided to strike out on their own after struggling to secure jobs in mid-life. Mrs Png, 74, holds a bachelors degree in accounting froma local universityand a Master of Business Administration from the University of Leicester in Britain. After leaving her last position as a group financial controller in 2005 due to burnout, she found it difficult to land another role. Mr Png, 73, who went to vocational school, had worked as a technician before becoming a full-time musician, which he loved but felt offered limited prospects. In 2009, they settled on the idea of starting a cafe where they could make a living from their passions. Mrs Png loved cooking; Mr Png enjoyed carpentry, basic plumbing and electrical work. They chanced upon a unit at Andrews Avenue in Sembawang. The space was essentially a wooden-decked porch later found to be termite-infested, but the rent, at under $3,000 a month for about 3,000 sq ft, was within reach. To save on renovation costs, they repaired the place themselves. For a month, they worked from 7am till midnight, patching floors, replacing planks and doing wiring, often through rain and sun. They ate breakfast and skipped other meals, losing between 5kg and 10kg each. We couldnt afford contractors, Mrs Png says. But the couple relished the hard work and each others support and companionship. A few months later, they rented the second level of the property when it was vacated, eventually moving in to save time and commuting costs. Mr Pngs two daughters from his previous marriage, now in their late 30s, moved into the couples fully paid three-room HDB flat in Clementi, where they lived for several years. When Woody opened in September 2009, rainy days meant zero customers, as the cafe hadan open-air concept. Whatever the couple earned went into makeshift canvas gazebos, which lasted only months. Slowly, the restaurant took shape and eventually sat up to 80 diners, with a metal-framed canvas cove installed in its thirdyear. The couple met in 2004, when Mrs Png visited a pub in Railway Mall where Mr Png was performing as part of a music duo. Sherequested the songBeautiful Girl by Jose Mari Chan. He did not know it then, but when she returned months later, he had learnt the song and crooned it to her. I was so touched, she recalls. Food is at the heart of their business union. Born into a Peranakan family, Mrs Png had loved cooking since childhood, learning from her mother and collecting recipes from a young age. At Woody, she insists on serving Peranakan dishes that take time and labour to prepare, even when they make little financial sense. Woodys Specialty Nasi Ulam ($18++) – a mix of seven fresh herbs, dried seafood and housemade sambal belachan – takes about nine hours to prepare a batch. Ingredients are chopped by hand and prepared every few days. I want our customers to enjoy the authentic and traditional taste of Peranakan fare, she says. Another signature dish, Babi Masak Sambal Buah Keluak ($18.90++), is even more labour-intensive. About 300 buah keluak are scrubbed with toothbrushes, boiled repeatedly with salt over an entire day, then cracked open to extract the flesh. Sixteen kilograms of pork belly are cooked in two cast-iron woks, with Mr Png stirring constantly to prevent burning. While ready-to-use buah keluak meat is widely available, she refuses to compromise. From about 2012, their business stabilised. At its peak, annual revenue hit above a million, enough to register for the goods and services tax. They hired six full-time employees, even a manager, and took short holidays in the region. Then Covid-19 hit. With no walk-ins, they pivoted to delivery. Mrs Png kept staff on full salaries – four full-timers and several part-timers – worried it would be hard to rehire them once pandemic restrictions were lifted. Monthly costs reached about $25,000. Losses began piling up in April 2020 and never stopped. To keep the business afloat, Mrs Png pawned her late mothers jewellery as well as her own for about $15,000. I cried inside, she says. Mr Png sold his Maton guitar and amplifier for $800. The guitar, a birthday gift from his sister decades earlier, had cost $1,600. In 2021, they sold their Clementi flat, intending to pay for a two-room flexi flat in Woodlands that they had applied for in 2019. Initially, $20,000 of the proceeds went into the business. Over the past four years, more than $100,000 has been poured in to pay for staff salaries, operating costs and a delivery van. The remainder from the sale of their flat went into their CPF retirement accounts. Desperate, they began borrowing from licensed moneylenders in 2023. Full-time staff members were let go of and replaced with interns and part-timers, with the couple doing most of the work themselves. To save money, they say they eat one main meal a day – the staff meal they cook for their part-timers – and chew on bread when hunger sets in later. They now owe about $20,000 to moneylenders and some outstanding rent – they declined to disclose the sum. Our landlord is very kind to us, Mrs Png says. If we fail, we would be homeless, Mr Png says. The couple have children from previous marriages. Mrs Png has two adult children, aged 43 and 40, and two grandchildren aged 15 and 11. Yet the couple are determined not to lean on family for help. We are not looking for handouts, Mr Png says. We do not want to burden anyone or society. Both have health issues. Mrs Png has thalassaemia – an inherited blood disorder – and high blood pressure, and suffers from panic attacks. She has fainted several times in the kitchen before. Mr Png suffered a heart attack eight years ago and had a stent inserted. The couple take care of each other. But there have been bleak moments when they wanted togive up. Yet they continue. Mrs Png still starts cooking at 5.30am. Mr Png carries 20kg pots, chops herbs, serves, bartends and washes dishes. Business picked up briefly in late 2024 after a viral video. Regulars returned. Some tipped generously. Whether it will last, they do not know. It is a success, having 16 years in this business, Mrs Png says. We transformed an empty porch into a restaurant. This cafe is our home. If we wrap it up, we will have no place to go.

Stop saying no more bubble tea in 2026: How to set realistic New Year resolutions,"Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a89d8304114adf11ca082d49cede8c2d30115aa29539e0c12f785727cd360133,2026 gives me the chance to set more practical resolutions that are attainable.ST ILLUSTRATION: CEL GULAPA,"['ST Headstart', 'ST Young & Savvy', 'Invest']","SINGAPORE –Thenew yearhas just begun, and with it, the setting of many unrealistic expectations that I have no hope of ever fulfilling. In previous years, I said things like no more bubble tea, exercise more, save more money and cut down on my travel spending!. None of those things ever came to pass. Some people try to get around this by setting resolutions that will definitely be achieved with no effort or that are vague enough that any little bit counts – things like save more could technically be achieved if I saved $1 more this year. Sometimes, resolutions are also based on what we see other people doing. Just opening Instagram during the last week of 2025 showed me lists of resolutions that perhaps work for others but are not tailored to my needs. Things like be happy or earn more reminded me of my own stop-buying-bubble-tea aspirations. So how do I go about setting useful, practical resolutions that can actually improve my financial health in 2026? I asked some experts for their top tips in goal setting. OCBC investment strategy managing director Vasu Menon said: Instead of vague resolutions, define measurable targets. He added that a way to ensure goals are not abandoned halfway is to break them up, such as setting a monthly savings target, instead of just saying save $20,000 in 2026. For instance, if I said I aim to save 20 per cent of my pay every month, that might be more useful than an annual target. UOB head of group personal financial services Jacquelyn Tan said: Make decisions from clarity rather than fear. On the surface, maybe that seemed rather general, but I realised, when reviewing my insurance policies for one, that decisions can indeed be made out of fear. As ahuge hypochondriac and aperson who has medical anxieties, I always fear the worst and bought insurance policies to cover me in health emergencies. I added any rider the agent said I should, and any other add-ons that he suggested, even if in hindsight, they were excessive or too expensive. Those decisions were made out of a mixture of fear and pressure from the insurance agent, rather than clarity in the types of protection that I wanted. DBS head of financial planning literacy Lorna Tan said that a goal can be to put idle cash to good use, such as investing. When it comes to high-yield savings accounts, there might be more cash than is needed to achieve the interest rates, and the extracan be put to use elsewhere. I guess a lot of my inaction just comes from sheer inertia. After a weeks worth of work, no one really wants to sit down at the laptop to do what I call personal admin – checking bank accounts, opening spreadsheets, paying credit card bills. But perhaps part of my goals could be setting aside time – maybe just once a month on a Saturday afternoon – to sit down and really look through my finances, review them and decide if I can put the money to better use. After consulting the experts, I created a list that hopefully is more realistic than those of previous years: Rather than saying no bubble tea, it seems more realistic to set a weekly cap for the drink. At the rate of price increases in todays economy, $10 may soon only be able to net me one cup of bubble tea. But the commitment would mean a sharp drop from the roughly $20 that I spent on three bubble teas a week in 2025. Cutting the amount in half will also save me from ingesting too much sugar – I hope. In 2025, I took a total of 16 flights, ranging from two hours to nearly 17 hours each time, and yet I earned and claimed a total of zero miles. A few weeks ago, I finally took the first step in miles collecting, by applying for a credit card. Id previously only stuck to debit cards because I didnt want to waste time and brain space thinking about miles or cashback. But after seeing more friends travel around the world for free – all flights redeemed through miles – I think upping my miles game is a good goal. And now that I am open to credit cards, maybe playing the miles game will be something that feels possible. The eventual goal is a free flight to London – some day. The Supplementary Retirement Scheme, or SRS, is a voluntary scheme to encourage people to save for retirement, over and above their Central Provident Fund savings. If contributions are made to the SRS account before Dec 31, one could gain some income tax relief in the following year of assessment. The yearlycapfor SRS contributions for Singapore citizens is $15,300, and the tax relief amount is the exact amount of SRS contributions made. The personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed, which includes the relief on SRS contributions. And while the SRS account does not earn the interest rate of 4 per cent that the CPF Special Account does, funds can be withdrawn with a penalty before the retirement age, rather than being absolutely locked in. SRS funds can also be invested in a wide variety of ways, such as unit trusts, SGX-listed stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This makes it an ideal way to cut down on the income tax I have to pay while allowing me to invest for long-term growth – it seems to be a win-win situation. Having compiled my little list of resolutions, what sort of goals are the real experts setting? OCBCs Mr Menon: In 2026, my goal is to take a more active role in managing my savings and investments to meet the multiple needs of my family. At 62, as a father of two young daughters aged eight and 10, financial planning is something I take very seriously. His aim: to have yield-generating assets as a significant part of his portfolio (bonds for coupon payments, stocks that pay dividends, unit trusts that invest in equities, fixed income), stocks for potential capital growth, and precious metals as a hedge against uncertainty. UOBs Ms Tan: My resolutions are to simplify decisions, strengthen resilience and stay invested in what truly compounds – financially and personally (including investing in personal relationships). I am less concerned with beating markets in any single year but rather more focused on ensuring my portfolio can compound steadily without forcing lifestyle trade-offs during volatility. DBS Ms Tan: This year, I plan to review my investments that are impacted by the low-interest-rate environment, and continue building sustainable multiple passive income flows to fund my retirement lifestyle. I have been contributing to the SRS and my penalty-free withdrawals over 10 years can start from age 62. Most of my SRS savings are invested in local stocks, which performed well last year (2025). Ive started to liquidate some of the stocks that I do not plan to keep in preparation for the penalty-free cash withdrawals that can commence in the coming years. I plan to place the cash component in safer instruments under SRS.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/stop-saying-no-more-bubble-tea-in-2026-how-to-set-realistic-new-year-resolutions
Me and My Money: He sees shoe shining and restoration as a craft and career,"Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e791b54dee8f3a253148895e55d6715bf5589ff0b9e7f0ec2663838cdb930487,"Mr John Chung, founder of Mason and Smith and Margo and Smith, chose shoemaking apprenticeships overseas to hone his craft over going to university.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO","['ST Headstart', 'ST Me & My Money', 'Invest', 'Money Mentor']","SINGAPORE – The traditional services of shoe shining and shoe restoration get a modern twist from Mr John Chung, who has managed to turn them into a viable business. He is the founder of Mason and Smith, which offers artisanal shoe care, and Margo and Smith, which deals in high-end handbag restoration. The business is also Singapores first shoe shine and repair salon with a dedicated luxury handbag restoration division. Mr Chung, 33, started his shoe shine ventures over a decade ago, when he was 21. He was accepted into Nanyang Technological University but chose to forgo higher education to pursue his business. He says: Im very hands-on and want to experience many things. I didnt come from a well-off family so I had to work to buy the things I wanted. It was indeed very difficult juggling studies and part-time work but I told myself one day I will be rewarded for my hard work and kept pushing on. Mr Chung started with just $700 and a fascination for second-hand leather shoes. In 2013, he began buying used leather shoes, restoring them by hand and selling them at local flea markets for a profit. In 2014, he introduced a shoe shine chair concept in collaboration with The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, offering traditional hand-polished shoe shine services from a classic chair set-up. In the following year, he launched Singapores first dedicated shoe shine bar – a concept that combined professional shoe repair with high-quality, hand-finished shoe shining in a refined setting. I developed a strong appreciation for leather as a material – its beauty, durability and ability to withstand the test of time. Some leather artifacts and collectibles can last for decades or even over a century, and the fact that they can be restored and revitalised after years of use truly captivated me, he recalls. To hone his craft, Mr Chung undertook a shoemaking apprenticeship in 2016 under Japanese shoemaker Masaru Okuyama in Hong Kong. He subsequently relocated to Japan to study shoemaking full time, apprenticing with several renowned bespoke shoemakers and immersing himself in traditional Japanese techniques. This magical quality of leather sparked a passion that led me to study the material in depth. I discovered that leather is most commonly used in footwear and bags, which pulled me deeper into the world of craftsmanship. That was the beginning of my journey – and of my love for shoes and bags, he says. His techniques are now showcased at his dual-concept flagship store in Ann Siang Road. He has also launched his own ready-to-wear and made-to-order footwear line, alongside digital initiatives to modernise the leather care experience, such as tele-consultations and digital order tracking. Mr Chung is an A-level holder and his wife, 31, helps to run the business. A:I bought my first stock while serving in the army – it marked the beginning of my self-taught journey in finance and investing. Without formal academic training, I committed myself to learning independently – reading financial news daily, tracking market movements, and staying informed on global economic trends. Over time, I developed a strong focus on equity investing, alongside a growing interest in the Singapore property market, which I study closely out of a deep curiosity for how value is created and preserved over time. Since I do not have a university degree, Ive always treated every subject I pursue as a kind of mini degree – a self-directed course in lifelong learning, grounded in discipline, consistency and passion. Because of my work in shoemaking and restoration, I also invest time in studying leathercraft and footwear construction. Understanding the materials, history and techniques behind each piece enhances my craft and deepens my connection to it. A:I dont collect tangible pieces purely for their potential to appreciate in value – what draws me in are the artistry and story behind each object. Over the years, Ive gathered a few meaningful items that reflect my appreciation for craftsmanship. Among them are vintage footwear from the 1970s and 1980s made by Nikolaus Tuczek, a legendary bespoke shoemaker whose work continues to inspire shoemakers even today. I also collect vinyl records, and one of my most prized possessions is a rare recording by Teresa Teng – a piece that carries both personal and cultural significance. In addition, I own a few select watches crafted by Otsuka Lotec, a small but respected Japanese watchmaker whose mechanical precision and understated design deeply resonate with me. Each item in my collection reflects a moment, a maker or a tradition that I admire. For me, collecting is not about building a portfolio – its about honouring the beauty of craft, history and human expression. A:Ive always had a passion for collecting mechanical items like CDs and cameras – theres something fascinating about the precision and craftsmanship behind them. Music has played a huge role in my life growing up. My dad was a big fan of hi-fi systems, and many of my childhood memories are wrapped in the sounds of songs and tunes that still stay with me vividly. Alongside this love for music, my fascination with shoes grew over time and eventually blossomed into the business I run today. Im also an avid vinyl record collector, constantly drawn to the warmth and authenticity that only records can capture. A:One of my biggest financial mistakes happened early in my investing journey, around the age of 18 to 20. Back then, I would often buy stocks simply because they were popular or seemed like the next big thing. Id scan the news, anticipate price movements, and trade hastily based on headlines – almost like gambling. Many of those stocks performed poorly over time, leading to disappointing results. The experience taught me the critical importance of doing thorough research and exercising patience. A:One of my notable experiences was buying my home during the Covid-19 pandemic. I wanted to handle the entire transaction myself but didnt know where to start, so I began by studying the Council for Estate Agencies, or CEA, textbook. This gave me a solid foundation in the basics of home ownership. From there, I dived deeper – reading books and researching various details to ensure I was well-informed throughout the process. Ultimately, I found a well-valued home in Tampines, which has since appreciated by $200,000. A:Growing up, my family lived simply and frugally, which instilled in me a mindset of making the most out of what you have. That background helped shape the values I brought into my business – prioritising function, sustainability and thoughtful spending over flashy beginnings. A:I wanted to be a footballer. I did join the national junior under-14 soccer team eventually, but I grew out of that dream. A:I own a four-room resale flat in the east. A:A green Volkswagen Golf. A:I would kick-start the day with a good run, have an amazing and nutritious breakfast and spend time with my loved ones. A:I would set aside a portion to donate to those in need, as giving back has always been important to me. Since I was 18, Ive been actively visiting orphanages overseas and have made it a point to give whenever I can. With the remainder, I would invest in property – an area Ive studied closely and believe in for long-term growth and stability. A:Buy a second-hand item, add value to it, sell it and continuously flip it multiple times with various different products for profit. This is probably the best way to increase that small pot of cash and grow it quickly.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/me-and-my-money-he-sees-shoe-shining-and-restoration-as-a-craft-and-career

US banks concerned over Trump call to slash credit card rates,"Jan 11, 2026, 01:57 AM","Jan 11, 2026, 01:58 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/22a0f8acb6450b1d34e9557ad3afa84f98c14210ec0e34b240c0250b068b13c7,US President Donald Trump - facing midterm elections in November 2026 - has called for a 10 per cent cap on credit card interest rates.PHOTO: DOUG MILLS/NYTIMES,"['United States', 'Donald Trump', 'Credit/Debit cards', 'Banks and financial institutions']","WASHINGTON - The US banking industry is warning that President Donald Trumps plans to lower credit card costs would make credit less available and hurt consumers and businesses. Mr Trump said on Jan 9 that effective Jan 20, the first anniversary of his administration, he was calling for a 10 per cent cap on credit card interest rates. We will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, he said on Truth Social. Five associations representing US banks responded that they shared the presidents goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit. At the same time, evidence shows that a 10 percent interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the associations said in a joint statement late on Jan 9. If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives, it said. The statement was issued by the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum and Independent Community Bankers of America. Credit cards are the primary source of consumer credit in the United States. Costs and outstanding balances have soared in recent years as people increasingly rely on them to maintain spending, even for basic necessities. According to data from the Federal Reserve, the total outstanding credit card debt exceeded US$1.23 trillion (S$1.5 trillion) at the end of September – the fourth-largest source of household debt, after mortgages, student loans and auto loans. Interest rates on credit cards are at least 21 per cent and can reach as high as 38 per cent for borrowers with a higher risk profile, according to the Fed. This is up from an average of around 12 per cent a decade ago. With midterm elections due in November, Mr Trump is under pressure to reduce the cost of living as promised during his 2024 election campaign amid stubborn inflation and consumers complaints that they struggle to make ends meet. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, voiced scepticism that Mr Trump was serious about capping rates, noting that he has sought to shutter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a consumer watchdog. Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke, Ms Warren said in a statement on Jan 9. Trump doesnt care about affordability.

Wall Streets three main indexes all gained sharply in 2026s first full week of trading, fuelled by increases in materials, industrials and other sectors that have lagged technology stocks in recent years. A Labour Department report showed US employment growth slowed more than expected in December, but a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.4 per cent suggested the labour market was not rapidly deteriorating. Chip stocks rallied, with the PHLX semiconductor index jumping 2.7 per cent to a record high. Lam Research rallied 8.7 per cent to US$218.36 after Mizuho raised its price target on the chip manufacturing tool maker to US$220 from US$200. Broadcom rose 3.8 per cent, Alphabet added 1 per cent and Tesla climbed 2.1 per cent, all lifting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Vistra jumped 10.5 per cent after Meta Platforms agreed to buy power from the companys nuclear plants. On the overall AI theme, investors are getting granular and picking the winners and losers in terms of sub-themes and individual names, said Mr Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. We view that as a more positive development. It means that were getting closer to the monetisation phase, where people can actually see and touch the revenue enhancements that are going to come from this revolutionary technology. Intel rallied almost 11 per cent after Mr Trump said he had a great meeting with the chipmakers chief executive officer, Mr Lip-Bu Tan. The S&P 500 climbed 0.65 per cent to end the session at 6,966.28 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.82 per cent to 23,671.35 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.48 per cent to 49,504.07 points. Nine of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by materials, up 1.8 per cent, followed by a 1.24 per cent gain in utilities. For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 per cent, the Nasdaq rose 1.9 per cent and the Dow added 2.3 per cent. Valuations on Wall Street were relatively high ahead of fourth-quarter earnings season. The S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, down from 23 in November, but above its five-year average of 19, according to LSEG data. Underscoring a recent shift towards stocks that have underperformed in recent years, the S&P 500 value index has climbed about 2 per cent so far in 2026, beating a 1 per cent gain in the S&P 500 growth index. The US Supreme Court said it would not issue a ruling on Jan 9 on the legality of US President Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs. This left investors, many of whom expected a decision, awaiting clarity. Traders anticipate heightened volatility across financial markets if the court strikes down the tariffs. Mortgage lenders rose a day after Mr Trump said he is ordering his representatives to buy US$200 billion in mortgage bonds to bring down housing costs. LoanDepot surged 19.3 per cent, Rocket Companies gained 9.6 per cent and Opendoor Technologies rallied 13.1 per cent. The Philadelphia Housing index gained 5.7 per cent to its highest since October. General Motors shares fell more than 2 per cent after the automaker said on Jan 8 it would take a US$6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments. Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.3-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 48 new highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 140 new highs and 62 new lows.

The US labour market remained stuck in what economists and policymakers have called a no hire, no fire mode.PHOTO: AFP","['US economy', 'Employment', 'Labour market']","WASHINGTON–US job growth slowed more than expected in December amid business caution about hiring because of import tariffs and rising artificial intelligence (AI) investment, but the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 per cent, supporting expectations that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchangedin January. Non-farm payrolls increased by 50,000 jobs in December after rising by a downwardly revised 56,000 in November, the Labour Departments Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) said on Jan 9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 60,000 jobs added after a previously reported 64,000 increase in November. The closely watched employment report suggested that the labour market remained stuck in what economists and policymakers have called a no hire, no fire mode. It also confirmedthatthe economy was in a jobless expansion. Economic growth and worker productivity surged in the third quarter, in part attributed to the AI spending boom. The labour market lost considerable momentum in 2025, largely blamed on President Donald Trumps aggressive trade and immigration policies, which economists and policymakers said reduced both demand for and supply of workers. The sharp moderation in job growth, however, started in 2024. The BLS has estimated that about 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the 12 months through March 2025 than previously reported. The agency will publish its payrolls benchmark revision in February 2026with the January employment report. The overcounting has been blamed on the birth-death model, which is used by the BLS to estimate how many jobs were gained or lost because of companies opening or closing in a given month. In December2025, the BLS said it would, starting in January2026, change the birth-death model by incorporating current sample information each month. Together with the December employment report, the BLS published annual revisions to the household survey data for the past five years. The unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey. The annual population control adjustments, normally incorporated with the January employment report, will be delayed. Novembers unemployment rate was revised down to 4.5 per cent from the previously reported 4.6 per cent. The median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists was for the jobless rate to have eased to 4.5 per cent in December. Some economists say low supply has prevented a sharp rise in the unemployment rate. They estimated that between 50,000 and 120,000 jobs need to be created each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The US central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent range in December, but officials indicated that they were likely to pause further reductions in borrowing costs for now to get a better sense of the economys direction. With factors like tariffs and AI preventing companies from hiring more workers, economists increasingly view the labour markets challenges as more structural than cyclical, which would make rate cuts less effective to stimulate job growth.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/us-job-growth-slows-in-december-unemployment-rate-eases-to-4-4
"Gold, Bitcoin and REITs: What investors should consider for their portfolios in 2026","Jan 09, 2026, 09:20 PM","Jan 10, 2026, 06:56 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ebdc66cb052bcf919e3839965bffe18821288fb7f4a2d63d6dff0528d46748d6,"Gold is highlighted as a safe haven asset, with gold prices rising to US$4,470 per ounce, and Bitcoin shows resilience amid uncertainty.PHOTO: REUTERS","['SGX', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'Investment']","SINGAPORE – Financial markets have had a volatile start to 2026, driven in part by heightened geopolitical tensions after the United Statescaptured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduroon Jan 3, and renewed headlines around US President Donald Trumps interest in acquiring Greenland. These developments mark a shift from 2025s market concerns, which were largely on US tariff policy and fiscal debt, and their potential impact on global growth. They also come as the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to continue lowering interest rates in 2026 after three cuts in 2025, though uncertainty remains over what the Feds next chairman, who is set to take over in May, will do. In view of these changing circumstances, investors taking steps to protect and optimise their portfolios for 2026 should consider these three asset classes to help navigate volatility: Golds role as a safe haven asset in investor portfolios in 2026 is expected to grow further after prices rose to record levels in 2025. Gold prices, now trading at around US$4,470 per ounce, are already up by around 3.5 per cent since the start of the year amid heightened geopolitical risk following Maduros capture. Mr Trumps unprecedented actions in Venezuela have disrupted the world order even further and created more geopolitical uncertainties, which augur well for safe havens like gold, said Mr Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC. While Venezuela on its own will not impact the global economic outlook meaningfully, what has happened there has led to questions about which other territories could be potential targets for Mr Trump. Theseinclude Iran, Greenland, Colombia, Mexico and Cuba. Its unclear if Mr Trump will follow through with his rhetoric and if his bark is worse than his bite, said Mr Menon. Over the longer term, the US move on Venezuela could weaken the global system of shared rules that countries rely on, said Mr Bertram Lai, CGS International Securities head of research. This could prompt China and other countries to speed up efforts to reduce their reliance on the US dollar, shifting more of their reserves into assets such as gold, he said. Bitcoin prices, which capped a year of gains in 2025 to close at around US$88,000, rose immediately after the US struck Venezuela, hitting levels above US$93,000 on Jan 6 before falling back to US$90,000 levels on Jan 9. What were seeing following the Venezuela developments is a market responding to geopolitical uncertainty with more selectivity, said Ms Gracie Lin, chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange OKX Singapore. Gold has moved higher, in line with its traditional role as a hedge, equities have remained relatively resilient, and Bitcoin has held up alongside them. This reflects how investors are increasingly using crypto as part of a broader hedging toolkit in a more fragmented macro environment. While retail sentiment remains cautious, larger and more sophisticated investors are adding risk in a measured way, Ms Lin noted. Capital flows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF have turned strongly positive at the start of 2026. BlackRocks iShares Bitcoin Trust saw inflows of US$287.4 million (S$370 million)in a single day on Jan 2, representing the largest daily haul in nearly three months, according to data from crypto exchange Independent Reserve (IR). That contributed to total net flows of US$471 million into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on the first trading day of the year, IR said. For longer-term holders, Bitcoins appeal continues to rest on its scarcity, decentralisation and role as a digital store of value, Ms Lin said. These attributes tend to support conviction during periods of uncertainty. Funds have been flowing back into Singapores stock market, where the central bank has taken deliberate steps to revive liquidity and investor interest. As the average value of securities traded daily rose 21 per cent in 2025 to nearly $1.5 billion – the highest level since 2010 – and with retail participation at a four-year high, investors can no longer afford to ignore the Singapore market, said Ms Carmen Lee, head of equity research at OCBC Group Research. Singapore Exchange-listed real estate investment trusts (REITs) could continue to offer opportunity, with real estate transaction activity and yields expected to stabilise under lower interest rates in 2026. Investment research firm Morningstar thinks Keppel REIT is undervalued for its high-quality office portfolio and best in class tenant base, and expects it to benefit from a tightening Singapore office market. Morningstar also likes Mapletree Industrial Trust for the REITs data centre portfolio, and management efforts to optimise its industrial property holdings. OCBC reckons gaining exposure to REITs with Singapore assets could be a prudent strategy, given the defensive nature of the sector, the resilience of local property values and favourable domestic funding conditions. It prefers the retail-sector REITs, saying landlords are able to charge higher rents on lease renewals and keep most of their space fully occupied. Its top picks are CapitaLand Ascendas REIT and CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, as well as Keppel DC REIT, Parkway Life REIT and OUE REIT.

First announced on Nov 19 as part of the MAS Equity Market Review Groups final recommendations to revive the local stock market, the GLB was designed to enable companies to simultaneously list and access growth capital across the US and Singapore. It is targeted to launch around the middle of 2026. MAS is proposing to allow a single set of offer documents for companies that want to list on both bourses by incorporating US prospectus disclosure requirements for initial public offerings (IPOs) and post-listing stages. Under current requirements, issuers prepare their prospectuses based on two sets of disclosure requirements. This incurs additional time and costs. MAS also proposes shortening the prospectus registration process to better align Singapores IPO timeline with that of the US. This change would allow the final prospectus in Singapore to be lodged and registered as soon as the US registration statement becomes effective. Current regulations require IPO prospectuses to be filed and made available to the public for at least seven days before registration can take place. The proposed change makes it easier for companies to coordinate their prospectus approval and fund-raising timelines in Singapore and the US. At the post-listing stage, MAS proposes the introduction of three safe harbours for GLB issuers, which are similar to those in the US: A safe harbour for forward-looking statements to protect companies and related parties from civil lawsuits, as long as the statements meet the same conditions used in the US and are not false or misleading; A share buyback safe harbour to protect companies and related buyers from criminal and civil liability if they follow US rules on how, when, at what price and how much they buy back shares; A pre-determined trading plan safe harbour granting defence to criminal and civil liabilities if a person complies with US regulations on insider trading. All issuers, not just GLB ones, could also be allowed to engage retail investors earlier in the IPO process, after lodging their preliminary prospectus with MAS. This aligns the timing of their engagement with retail investors more closely with US practice. Another MAS proposal would treat the company behind the underlying shares as the issuer and offeror of sponsored depositary receipts (DRs), instead of the bank that issues them. This would make that issuer responsible for prospectus registration, and liable for prospectus‑related misstatements or omissions under the Securities and Futures Act. A sponsored DR lets investors buy and sell shares of a foreign company on their local stock exchange without dealing with overseas markets. SGX RegCo listed out a set of requirements for GLB eligibility in its proposal. Issuers must have a market capitalisation of at least $2 billion, and be listed or accepted for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. In addition, they must either post a total revenue of at least US$90 million (S$115.6 million) in the latest completed financial year, or satisfy income or assets with equity requirements. They will be delisted from the GLB if they do not maintain their listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. A Singapore resident independent director or Singapore-based compliance adviser must also be appointed. To facilitate retail participation, they must allocate a minimum of 5 per cent or $50 million of their offering, whichever is less, to at least one designated retail brokerage in Singapore. This is currently not required for IPOs in the US. SGX RegCo will retain discretion over the admission and continued listing of securities on the GLB. Public consultation on the proposed amendments will close on Feb 8. Some industry insiders welcomed the move, although others noted that the changes, if carried out, hinge on the stock market continuing its current run. Mr David Gerald, chief executive of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), or Sias, said the proposed changes could bring the best of both markets to investors in Singapore, and noted that Sias would continue to play its role in helping to educate investors. But Mr Robson Lee, director at law firm Legal Solutions, noted that attracting new and large issuers to list on the GLB would depend on the Singapore market sustaining the upswing momentum seen since the second half of 2025. He added that an immediate challenge facing the GLB would be the availability of issue managers, underwriters and placement agents who are knowledgeable in the capital market requirements and practices in both the US and Singapore. There would also need to be requisite distribution and selling networks to competently conduct road shows and undertake the sale of the issuers securities. Mr Lee also noted that the safe harbour provisions could pose a challenge to how authorities determine if there has been a breach in regulations by the issuer, and how they would exercise prosecutorial discretion.

Villa held off a strong Tottenham fightback in the second half after goals by Emiliano Buendia and Morgan Rogers had put them in control by halftime in north London. Wilson Odobert halved the deficit with a low shot after 54 minutes and Tottenham showed the fighting spirit that was sadly lacking in the first half, although it did spill over. Tottenham midfielder Joao Palhinha was enraged as Watkins and other Villa players went to celebrate in front of their fans, with players from both sides involved in ugly scenes. I saw what I saw. Of course its all about keeping a cool head. The players gave everything, everything out there, (but) losing a tight game, season not going perfect and I think Ollie (Watkins) is very provoking, Frank told reporters. The way he is going down to celebrate in front of the Villa fans and he is walking into Joao, he can just easily walk around. I think everyone that has been in a competitive nature, that is difficult and can trigger things. The FA Cup exit deepened Franks problems as his side again failed at home, having won only twice in 10 Premier League games in front of their own fans. After the 3-2 loss at Bournemouth in midweek several players became involved in heated discussion with fans while captain Cristian Romero was suspended on Saturday after getting an extra one-match ban for acting improperly by failing to leave the field of play promptly after his red card against Liverpool. Asked if his side have a discipline problem, Frank said: When you play with passion, then sometimes you play to the line. And sometimes a little bit borderline, he said. Tottenham were booed off at halftime and suffered another blow when striker Richarlison pulled up with a hamstring injury. Frank said the injury was likely the result of the workload players faced over the Christmas and New Year period. I think weve done a lot of things right to get him where he is now. I think hes done a lot of things right. Its not only about us, its about every club. I think theres a few injuries across the Premier League. I think its something for the football authorities to look into as well, he said. We played five games in 13 days, four in ten. One of the few clubs who did that.

Frank is on the brink after Tottenham paid the price for conceding twice in a woeful first-half display in north London. Emiliano Buendia put Villa ahead and Morgan Rogers increased the visitors lead. Tottenham improved after the break but although Wilson Odobert reduced the deficit, they were unable to avoid a second successive defeat. The loss ended in suitably ugly fashion for Tottenham as their frustrated players became embroiled in a clash with Villa after the final whistle as boos cascaded from the stands. Tottenham have won just three of their past 14 games and sit 14th in the Premier League, only three places above where they ended last season under Ange Postecoglou. If Frank can survive until next weekend, another loss at home to lowly West Ham would surely bring an end to his disastrous reign. Frank added to his problems when he drank from a cup emblazoned with the branding of Spurs bitter rivals Arsenal before Tottenhams 3-2 defeat at Bournemouth on Jan 7. That embarrassing gaffe drew the ire of Tottenham supporters, who once again booed Frank and his players at the final whistle. Now Frank is out of the Cup following the latest damp squib in the former Brentford managers wretched first season in charge. Hired to replace the sacked Postecoglou, who ended the north Londoners 17-year trophy drought by winning the Europa League last season, Frank increasingly looks out of his depth at a club with Tottenhams expectations. Villa, who havent won the FA Cup since 1957, have now won twice at Tottenham this season after a 2-1 victory in the Premier League in October. Unai Emerys team also beat Tottenham in the FA Cup fourth round last season. Desperate to buy himself some breathing space, Frank ignored the trend of Premier League managers resting their key players in the FA Cup by naming a strong line-up. To mark the 125th anniversary of becoming the first non-league side to lift the FA Cup, Tottenham wore a special commemorative kit with no player surnames on the back and the sponsors and club badge less visible than usual on the front. Unfortunately for Frank, Tottenhams first-half display was closer to a non-league effort than the standards expected of his expensively assembled team. Villa took the lead from their first serious attack in the 22nd minute. John McGinn and Donyell Malen carved through the creaky Tottenham defence with a rapid exchange of passes before Buendia lashed high into the roof of the net from 10 yards. Villa fans taunted the Tottenham boss with chants of Thomas Frank is an Arsenal fan. And Franks problems mounted when Brazil striker Richarlison limped off with an apparent hamstring injury. Tottenham were rudderless and it was no surprise when Rogers bagged Villas second goal on the stroke of half-time. It was the kind of flowing move that Frank has so rarely been able to inspire from his players as Buendias deft back-heel teed up Rogers for a clinical close-range finish. Tottenham were improved in the second half and Odobert reduced the deficit in the 54th minute. Randal Kolo Muani won possession in midfield and slipped a pass to Odobert, whose low drive arrowed into the far corner from 12 yards. In a brief burst of pressure, Xavi Simons hit the post before Kolo Muanis strike forced a save from Marco Bizot. But their momentum fizzled out in the closing stages to leave Frank with nowhere to hide.",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/aston-villas-fa-cup-win-at-spurs-leaves-frank-on-the-brink

Moez Echargui of Tunisia during his first round match against Daniel Evans of Britain. REUTERS/Edgar Su","['Jannik Sinner', 'Carlos Alcaraz']","LONDON, Jan 10 - For every Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz, there are hundreds of professional tennis players doing the hard yards on the lower tours, scratching out a living before calling it a day. Tunisias Moez Echargui fits into that category. This time last year he was ranked just inside the top 500 and earned $2,160 for winning an ITF tournament in Monastir. Now Echargui stands on the cusp of a career breakthrough -- at an age when many journeymen are thinking about what to do once they have hung up their rackets. A stunning run on the ATP Challenger Tour last year has lifted him to 134th in the world and into the Australian Open qualifying tournament next week, his first taste of life at a Grand Slam. There remains the task of winning three matches in Melbourne to reach the main draw, but for Echargui, just being in qualifying is a reward for persevering when others might have stopped chasing the dream. When I arrived at Melbourne Park to get my accreditation, I was like, Gosh, Ive made it here, Echargui, the highest‑ranked African player in the world, told Reuters by telephone. Seeing all the signs with AO everywhere, it was an exciting moment. I felt like a little kid. The difference from the stages on which he usually plies his trade was striking, said the Milan‑based player, who holds a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Nevada. Everythings made easy for the players. The food is free, the laundry, the transport. There are staff available to help. It actually feels easy to be here. It certainly was not an easy journey to get there. INJURY PROBLEMS Echargui was close to a top-100 junior, but a combination of injuries and limited funding led him to focus on his studies before deciding to try his luck on the pro ranks in 2017. He moved to Milan in 2019 to train at the MXP Academy under coach Paolo Moretti, but a serious wrist injury along with knee and hamstring problems left his career in jeopardy. His career highlight seemed to arrive in 2024 when he qualified for the Paris Olympics via an International Tennis Federation (ITF) place after winning the African Games, earning a first‑round appearance at Roland Garros, where he lost to Britains Dan Evans. What looked like a retirement story instead became a turning point. Like a fine wine, Echargui has improved with age and now, in his 30s, has a chance to establish himself on the ATP Tour. At 29 years old, I made the decision to go to Milan. I think a lot of people at that age would say, Maybe Im at the end of my career, he said. Why go to another country, leave my parents and family? But I think Ive made a good decision. Tough moments, but good moments too. During a 17-match winning run last summer Echargui won successive ATP Challenger titles in Porto and Hersonissos last before another title run in St Tropez. He made his ATP Tour main‑draw debut in Metz in November, losing to American eventual champion Learner Tien. Whether or not he qualifies in Australia, Echargui looks set to taste tenniss bigger stages this year on the ATP Tour and will target the top 100. Its been a bumpy journey and the dream could have faded away, but when I look back, I think I passed through the storm, he said. I deserve to be here. No one gave it to me.

Centre back Rami Rabia was the other scorer for the Egyptians, who had little possession at the Grande Stade Agadir but took their chances with clinical precision and held on grimly to book a semi-final meeting with Senegal on Jan 14. An own goal from Ahmed Fatouh and a late effort by Guela Doue proved insufficient for the Ivory Coast, winners of the tournament on home soil two years ago but now deposed as African champions. Egypt, who have won a record seven Cup of Nations titles, wasted little time in taking the lead as Marmoush scored in the fourth minute after Hamdi Fathy pinched the ball from Franck Kessie in the midfield, allowing Emam Ashour to thread a pinpoint ball to the sprinting Marmoush. He still needed to shrug off the attentions of defender Odilon Kossounou before slotting home. But it quickly became clear the Ivorians were going to dominate possession, showing much more physical strength on the ball but without setting up clear chances. Egypt went 2-0 up in the 32nd minute when Rabia rose above the defenders to head his side further ahead from a corner. The Ivory Coast, who had 70 per cent of possession in the first half, reduced the deficit eight minutes later when teenager Yann Diomandes freekick near the corner took a slight brush off Kossounous head and ricocheted off the knee of full back Fatouh and into the net. The Ivorians had come from 2-0 down to beat Gabon 3-2 earlier in the tournament but hopes of turning the scoreline around soon after the re-start were stymied by a simply created, but superbly finished, goal for Salah seven minutes after the break. Rabia was well inside his own half when he chipped the ball over the top of the Ivorian defensive line, allowing Ashour to run onto it and hit an accurate pass with the outside of his right boot into the path of Salah to score. An Ivorian comeback was still on when Doue touched home at the end of a goalmouth scramble in the 73rd minute. That set up a siege of the Egyptian goal in the final 15 minutes but they held out to advance. Earlier on Jan 10, Nigeria overpowered Algeria 2-0 in Marrakech and will take on hosts Morocco in the other semi-final.

Osimhen steered home a long cross from the left by Bruno Onyemaechi two minutes into the second half as Algeria goalkeeper Luca Zidane made a bizarre jump to try and stop the effort but ended up getting his angles wrong and conceding an easy goal. Adams increased Nigerias lead 10 minutes later as Osimhen unselfishly fed him the ball and he took it round Zidane before placing it into an empty net. It was an impressive performance by Nigeria, who two months ago missed out on World Cup qualification, as they overwhelmed their opponents from the start at the Grand Stade de Marrakech, looking more determined, quicker around the field and stronger in the challenges, and denying their opponents a single scoring chance. The victory was deserved. The match was fantastic, and I am very happy with the win, said Nigeria coach Eric Chelle. Algeria were already hanging on grimly in the first half with Nigeria having good chances to be ahead at the break. Algeria centre back Ramy Bensebaini cleared off the line in the 29th minute from Calvin Bassey after the depth of Ademola Lookmans free kick was misjudged by Zidane and the Nigeria full back was able to steer an effort goalward from a tight angle. NIGERIA MISS CHANCES TO SECURE BIGGER VICTORY Bensebaini hooked it clear, although television replays looked to show the whole circumference of the ball had crossed the line. A VAR check in the absence of goalline technology, however, did not award a goal. In the 37th minute, a poor clearance from Zidane to full back Aissa Mandi was intercepted by Alex Iwobi who quickly fed the ball to Adams, but the Sevilla strikers left-footed effort missed the target with only the goalkeeper to beat. Adams also headed against the upright in the 82nd minute as Osimhens enterprise and persistence again set him up with a clear chance. Algeria had been forced to play extra time before winning their last-16 clash against the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday and the exertion could have been the reason many of their key players turned in listless performances. In contrast, Nigeria had a comfortable 4-0 win over Mozambique on Monday. I dont want to go into too many details, but Nigeria were better. The Nigerian team showed the individual skills they possess, and physically we were behind. We tried to come back in the second half, but we couldnt reach the level we needed in attack, said Algeria coach Victor Petkovic.

For other competitors, it is the realisation of a lifelong dream. For Matthias Kahnt, the 39-year-old skipper of Walross 4, it is an opportunity to share his love of sailing with a crew of students - and to pass on lessons from a transatlantic crossing that will stay with them for life. Kahnt is leading a novice crew drawn from Berlins Akademischer Segler-Verein, a German sailing club focused on connecting students with offshore sailing. While Olympians, Americas Cup veterans and world champions across the fleet are scrutinising tiny marginal gains, Kahnt is drilling the fundamentals. We have done a lot of provisioning… I think its the biggest challenge for the young crew, to calculate how much water do we need for the crossing to have some spare water as well, he said. The crew will sail the race using a classic two-watch system. Two watch captains and each watch has four people and theyre just changing during the day time every six hours and during the night every four hours, Kahnt said. The race forms part of a wider project aimed at promoting sailing and international relationships. Walross 4 - a Nissen 56 with more than 130,000 nautical miles logged, including a global circumnavigation and a Sydney-Hobart Race - is bound for New York on July 4. We are going to celebrate the German and American relationship on their 250th birthday… we will go there with other big tall ships and we are an ambassador of Berlin city, Kahnt said. So this is one part of the project for the Berlin students to get this race and making this transatlantic crossing with this RORC racing and get the ambience and regatta experience which is really fun and nice for the young people. While the fastest boats in the fleet are targeting a five-day crossing, Kahnt said he would be happy with 16 - with safety and wellbeing taking precedence. The Atlantic is quite a big distance, he said. So if theres anything happening on the boat youre quite dependent on the crew. The mood is most important I think, and of course the health of people… if theres any injury that would be I think the worst case. So, be healthy and dont get any injuries… that will be the biggest challenge for us. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/berlin-students-embark-on-rorc-transatlantic-race-to-antigua

The France forward, who has scored 12 goals in nine matches against Barcelona, flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday to join the squad ahead of the El Clasico showdown in Jeddah. Hes much better, Alonso told reporters. Against Atletico, he was just about ready, and we decided not to rush him, but we kept in mind that he might be able to play in the final. He flew yesterday and will train with the team today. Well assess him and decide whether hell start or play a little less. Its a decision well make with the player, the coaches and the doctors. The moment were in and whats at stake ... Its a controlled risk. Real beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Bernabeu in October after losing the Spanish Super Cup final and the Copa del Rey final to their arch-rivals last season. Were focused on what we have to do and how to play the match, Alonso said. It will be a match with moments for everything. We have to have the necessary energy. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick described Mbappe as the best striker around. Well adapt a little, but so will Real Madrid, the German said. We have to play the way Barcelona always plays, with our style, which is different from Real Madrids. Barcelona lead LaLiga with 49 points from 19 matches, four ahead of second-placed Real. Flick confirmed Lamine Yamal was ready to start, having come on as a substitute in Barcelonas 5-0 semi-final thrashing of Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.

The 24-year-old fell and careered into the side netting during the fourth downhill of the season in the Austrian resort of Zauchensee. Egger, the second highest-ranked Austrian in the downhill standings, was lifted off the mountain by helicopter and taken to hospital. Ski Austria said MRI scans had shown a rupture of the ligament, a tear of the collateral ligament and contusion of the lateral meniscus in her right knee. She was transferred to Innsbruck for surgery. Egger had celebrated a first World Cup podium in St Moritz last month when she finished second in the opening downhill of the season. Her injury is another blow to Austrias womens team after 2022 Olympic slalom silver medallist Katharina Liensberger was ruled out of the Games with a serious knee injury suffered in training this month. That really hurts because Magdalena has had good results and performed well, also with regard to what is coming in February, womens head coach Roland Assinger told Austrian media. The Olympic womens downhill in Cortina will be held on February 8. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/alpine-skiing-season-over-for-austrian-speed-specialist-egger
