Organised by theSecurity Association Singapore (SAS), the awards serve both as a benchmark for industry professionals and a practical guide for service buyers seeking reliable and forward-looking security partners. Gracing the event as Guest of Honour was Mr Dinesh Vasu Dash, Minister of State, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and Ministry of Manpower. He was joined by Members of Parliament Mr Melvin Yong, Ms Cassandra Lee and Ms Yeo Wan Ling. The award recipients here represent the very best of our industry – companies that have embraced innovation, service buyers who have championed professional development, and leaders who understand that transformation means investing in both technology and people, said Mr Dinesh during his speech at the awards ceremony. In total, 126 awards were presented at the event, recognising the best security firms within the industry. These award winners represent the vanguard of our industrys transformation. They have set a new benchmark, demonstrating through action what is possible when we embrace change and pursue excellence, said Mr Kelvin Goh, President of SAS, in his welcome address. Mr Steve Tan, former executive secretary of the Union of Security Employees (USE), received the prestigious SAS Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Security Industry. Widely regarded for his contributions to Singapores private security sector, Mr Tan has played a key role in improving the livelihoods of security officers.As a member of the Security Tripartite Cluster, he advocated for enhancements to the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), including wage increases, higher training standards and clearer pathways for career progression in an increasingly technology-driven industry. His leadership was instrumental in fostering tripartite consensus among the Government, employers and the labour movement, helping to ensure that reforms strengthened both workers welfare and the long-term sustainability of the sector. Beyond policy advocacy, Mr Tan also spearheaded initiatives such as a landmark survey on workplace abuse, and an updated Security Officer Handbook to raise awareness of rights and responsibilities. He was also responsible for establishing the Union of Security Employees (USE) Customer Service Centre to provide assistance to officers on the ground for administrative matters such as their ID card application and collection. The awards also highlighted firms setting benchmarks for excellence across the industry.The top honours – the Apex awards – were presented to four companies:Certis,Soverus Pte Ltd,Sands Global Pte LtdandOneSystems Technologies Pte Ltd. Certis clinched the Alexander Henson Security Agency of the Year for the second year running, along with 13 other awards. These awards celebrate the trust of our partners and the dedication of our people, whose professionalism and commitment drive operational excellence every day. With innovative solutions, technology-driven operations and a people-first approach, Certis continues to strive to outdo ourselves and deliver safer, smarter, and better security services, said Mr Zee Chong, senior vice president and head of Physical Security Business at Certis. Soverus was named Alexander Henson Security Agency of the Year (Non-Auxiliary Police). This recognition affirms our responsibility to uphold the highest standards, champion service excellence, and drive continuous improvement across the private security sector, said Mr Nicholas Leong, general manager of Soverus. The Alexander Henson Security Agency of the Year (Boutique) Award went to Sands Global. Calling it a deeply meaningful honour, its chief executive officer, Mr Chua Yi Da, said: Being acknowledged at this level affirms the dedication we bring to every site, every shift and every client we serve. As the industry continues to evolve, we remain committed to raising the bar and contributing to a safer and more resilient Singapore.The industrys transformation is also being shaped by technology specialists that enable new ways of delivering security services. This years Security Technology Firm of the Year award, which was introduced in 2023, went to OneSystems Technologies, a Singapore-based security technology firm that develops command-and-control platforms and digital solutions used by security agencies and organisations to manage operations, analyse data and respond to incidents more effectively. This milestone reinforces the role we play in supporting mission-critical operations across industries. We remain committed to building safer, smarter and more resilient environments for the communities we serve, said its chief executive officer Eunice Hong. As security services evolve in how they are delivered, procured and enabled by technology, the question of whether the workforce is ready has become just as critical.Central to the upskilling and training efforts, says Mr Dinesh, is the Security Progressive Wage Model (PWM). Developed by the Security Tripartite Cluster, the Security PWM sets the training requirements and accompanying wages for each job level of the security sector.He cited as an example Triple S Protection Private Limited, which received the Workforce Singapores Workforce Transformation Award. As part of its transformation efforts, the company redesigned security officers roles to include higher value-added responsibilities, such as operating and troubleshooting security robots. Officers were reskilled through Workforce Singapores Career Conversion Programme for Security Officers, enabling them to contribute more meaningfully to daily operations while improving productivity for the organisation.

In a written reply to Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied GRC) on Jan 13, Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said the police will notify claimants about the filing of claims in due course. He added that the distribution process is complex and may take some time, as there are numerous potential claimants. Ms Lim had asked about the case and when victims can file claims to the recovered proceeds. Genneva, a Singapore-registered investment firm,sold gold bars under a buyback schemebetween 2008 and 2012. Customers were promised returns of up to 36 per cent on their investments, and were told to deposit the gold bars with the company for inspection purposes. They were promised an equivalent quantity of gold after three working days. It was previously reported that the firm was estimated to have more than 10,000 customers. Genneva is believed to have collected around 3,500kg of gold from its customers. It experienced financial difficulties in 2012, and started defaulting on the return of the gold bars. But it continued with the inspection scheme, collecting more gold bars from customers, which were resold to new clients or pawned for cash. Eventually, Genneva racked up more than $40 million in losses for customers who participated in the inspection exercise. Mr Shanmugam said the police concluded their investigation into the case several years ago, and six people were charged in 2019. Five of them – including the firmsformer general manager,who was jailed in 2020 – have since been convicted of various offences, including fraudulent trading, cheating and money laundering. Court proceedings are still ongoing for the remaining person.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/police-to-apply-to-distribute-1-5m-in-seized-assets-to-claimants-in-genneva-gold-scam-shanmugam
Over 4 months jail for man who forced friend to drink urine over missing money,"Jan 13, 2026, 09:00 PM","Jan 13, 2026, 10:55 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/abde38c49932179d0895522c69804d3984edb1bbb22126c921e7857dc27efc11,"Cheong Wee Kiat, 27, pleaded guilty to one charge under the Computer Misuse Act and one count of criminal intimidation on Jan 13.ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG",[],"SINGAPORE – A man forced his friend to drink urine as punishment because he thought the friend had pocketed money from a bank account which had been given to someone else to control and whose funds were subsequently frozen. Cheong Wee Kiat, 27, pleaded guilty to one charge under the Computer Misuse Act and one count of criminal intimidation on Jan 13. He was sentenced to four months and eight weeks jail. His offence under the Computer Misuse Act is related to his role in getting the friend, identified in court documents as A1, to open a bank account for another person to use. In March 2022, A1 told Cheong he wanted to earn extra cash. Cheong knew that another friend of his, Tan, was offering cash in return for the use of bank accounts. He then introduced A1 to Tan, who also told Cheong that he could earn a commission if A1s bank account could be used for a long period of time. After A1 opened a corporate bank account with OCBC, he gave Tan theinternet bankingcredentials and the ATM card for the account. The accused was aware that A1 would be relinquishing a bank account to Tan and had introduced A1 to Tan for this purpose, Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicole Tay told the court. A1 soon began receiving bank statements, which A1s father saw detailed significant sums of money being transferred into the account. The father confronted A1 about the matter, and A1 eventually closed the account. On April 16, 2022, A1 lodged a police report saying that he had opened the OCBC bank account and relinquished it. The bank account, which contained more than $25,000, was frozen. Investigations revealed that more than $147,000 had been received and transferred out of the OCBC bank account. The funds were not traced to any police reports. Cheong and A1 did not receive any monetary benefit. Afraid that he would be asked to make repayments for the frozen funds, A1 cut off contact with Tan and Cheong. Tan and Cheong were unaware that the account had been frozen or that A1 had made a police report. They believed that A1 had closed the bank account and pocketed the money for himself. On Sept 12, 2022, Tan and Cheong, along with four others, confronted A1 about the money at the void deck of the flat where A1 lived. A1 insisted that he did not pocket the money, but later agreed to work to pay off the money. During the confrontation, Cheong punched A1 in the face, giving him a cut on his right eyebrow. The next day,the group decided to punish A1 by forcing him to drink their urine from a bottle. Not wanting to fight them, A1 drank three-quarters of the 1.5-litre bottle. The rest of the urine was poured over his head. Tan used his phone to take pictures and recorded a video of the incident, which was later deleted. Cheong took A1s NRIC, PAssion card and OCBC ATM card as collateral for the money owed before they parted ways. A1 made a police report about the incident on Sept 14, 2022.Cheong was arrested on the same day. DPP Nicole Tay sought a jail sentence of four months and eight weeksfor Cheong, noting that handing over bank accounts is a serious offence, given that scams have become a major and fast-growing concern. Addressing the criminal intimidation charge, DPP Tay said Cheongs actions were a real and significant threat of injury to A1s person. She described the act of making A1 drink urine and pouring it over his head as unnatural and deeply humiliating. In mitigation, Cheong said he was remorseful about his actions. He asked for his sentence to be deferred so he could settle his personal affairs. He will begin serving his sentence on Feb 27.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/over-4-months-jail-for-man-who-forced-friend-to-drink-urine-over-owed-money
"260 workers received $600,000 in salary relief after their firms were wound up","Jan 13, 2026, 07:45 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 06:30 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/4f60127bf004e93aa36728c52bd8374108fcbeb8ab37f01428dc70631cb6e6e8,"Companies that wilfully do not pay salaries despite having the means to do so will be investigated and face action for breaching employment laws when they wind up, warned Manpower Minister Tan See Leng.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI","['Singapore Parliament', 'Tan See Leng', 'Gerald Giam', 'The Business Times']","SINGAPORE - About $600,000 was paid out from the Governments short-term relief fund to 260 workers who went unpaid after their employers were liquidated between 2023 and 2025, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said on Jan 13. The fund, which is managed by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management, is intended for employers who truly cannot pay their salary arrears due to business failure, said Dr Tan. However, companies that wilfully do not pay salaries despite having the means to do so will be investigated and face action for breaching employment laws when they wind up, he warned. Dr Tan was responding to parliamentary questions from Workers Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) relating to workers who have been affected by corporate liquidation. These included those on the total number of workers affected in the last three years, the total quantum of unpaid wages, and the support rendered to these workers. Mr Giam also asked whether the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) would consider measures such as mandatory wage recovery insurance, imposing personal liability on company directors for unpaid salaries, and amending the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 to prioritise employees over secured creditors by default. He said amendments to the Act would deter irresponsible business closures and ensure workers are paid first. In his response, Dr Tan said MOM does not track the total number of workers with unpaid wages arising from corporate liquidations. However, he said the Government recognises the importance of employees claims on salaries in the event of their employers winding up. On the Act, Dr Tan said employees claims are already ranked first and above all other unsecured debts, behind only the costs and expenses of administration, which are necessary for the winding up to proceed smoothly. Beyond support through the short-term relief fund, the Government also helps affected workers search for and take on new jobs with good longer-term prospects through career-matching services and training programmes offered by Workforce Singapore, SkillsFuture Singapore and the National Trades Union Congress Employment and Employability Institute, he added. Eligible workers who become involuntarily unemployed can also receive up to $6,000 over six months under the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, while lower-income households in need of help with basic expenses may approach their social service office for financial assistance, Dr Tan said. Beyond measures to support displaced workers, the Government encourages and supports Singaporeans to take care of their career health and stay relevant in their jobs, he said, adding that initiatives such as Career Health SG can help workers better navigate challenges and stay resilient in their careers. In response to a separate parliamentary question from Peoples Action Party MP Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) on sectors that are actively hiring, Dr Tan said the financial and insurance services, professional services, and information and communications sectors have seen active hiring and wage growth for professionals, managers, executives and technicians. As at September 2025, there were 14,200 vacancies in these sectors, up from 12,600 a year earlier. Dr Tan said jobs within these sectors were suitable for new graduates. He added that in 2025, real median incomes in these sectors rose faster than the overall median growth of 4.3 per cent.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/260-workers-receive-600000-in-salary-relief-after-their-firms-were-wound-up

In an announcement on the mytransport.sg website at 7.13pm, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said that the minor delay affected MRT services in both directions. Commuters can continue to use the train service or consider free bus services at affected stations, it said. A few Reddit users said they were caught in the delay. One user said: The train had a loud bang after Farrer Road to Botanic Gardens, then the train stopped for 10 mins before Caldecott. Afterwards we were all told to get off at Caldecott, and the train didnt move off after. Another user said that commuters were told to alight at Tai Seng MRT station. Now trains towards Harbourfront are all crowded. No announcement from any station staff until I did some digging online, the user added. A commuter who declined to be named told The Straits Times that she was heading from Kent Ridge to Lorong Chuan when the train stopped before Caldecott station. She said there was a burning smell, though this dissipated in less than a minute. There was then an announcement that passengers had to get off at Caldecott station, she added. The train remained stationary for a few minutes before continuing on its journey at the normal speed. After passengers disembarked at Caldecott, the affected train left in the direction it came in, she said, adding that it took about eight minutes before the first replacement train appeared. However, four more trains passed before she could continue her journey. A check on the mytransport.sg website as at 7.43pm showed that train service was back to normal.

The elephant, a lone bull, is reported to have gone on the rampage for nine days beginning in early January, creating panic in the rural West Singhbhum district. We are trying to trace and rescue this violent wild elephant that killed so many people, government forest officer Aditya Narayan told AFP, confirming the toll of 20 dead. Children and the elderly are among the dead, as well as a professional elephant handler, known as a mahout. But after wreaking a trail of destruction, it had not been spotted since Jan 9, despite multiple patrols in the area. Officials said search teams, aided by drones, are combing dense forest tracts, including a national reserve in neighbouring Odisha state. Fear has driven residents of more than 20 villages to abandon their farms or barricade themselves indoors at night, elected village head Pratap Chachar told AFP. A police team, or forest official vehicle, visits in the night to provide essential help to villagers, Mr Chachar said. Hundreds of thousands of Indians are affected each year by crop-raiding elephants. Asian elephants are nowrestricted to just 15 per cent of their original habitat. The usually shy animals are coming into increasing contact with humans because of rapidly expanding settlements and growing forest disturbance, including mining operations. As elephant habitats shrink, conflict between humans and wild elephants has grown – 629 people were killed by elephants across India in 2023-2024, according to parliamentary figures. The elephants that pose the most danger to humans are often rogue bulls, solitary male animals enraged during musth, a period of heightened sexual activity when testosterone levels soar. A former forest official said the elephant was likely in musth, and may now have calmed down and rejoined its herd. India is home to the majority of the worlds remaining wild Asian elephants, a species listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and increasingly threatened by shrinking habitat. The Wildlife Institute of India in 2025 issued a new estimate, that put the countrys wild elephant population at 22,446, a report that also warned of the deepening pressures on one of Indias most iconic animals.

Trumps Iran tariff threat risks reopening China rift,"Jan 13, 2026, 09:05 PM","Jan 13, 2026, 11:15 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/091ed8088518ad175a0b1df59d721fdef2a1c0da5ac92ca7c0c555ebbf138843,US President Donald Trump (left) and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a deal in October 2025 to de-escalate the countries trade war.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['United States', 'Donald Trump', 'China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Iran']","BEIJING - US President Donald Trumps threat to slapa 25 per cent tariffon countries that trade with Iran risks reopening old wounds with Beijing, Tehrans biggest trading partner. Iran became a flashpoint in US-China ties during Mr Trumps 2017-21 first term as president as Washington tightened sanctions on Tehran andput Chinas Huawei,accused of selling technology to the Islamic Republic, in its crosshairs. Thearrest of Ms Meng Wenzhou,the daughter of Huaweis founder, in Canada at Washingtons request sparked retaliation and a hostage crisis, with bitter recriminations lingering for the remainder of Mr Trumps first administration. With Iran in his sights once again, the duty would see Chinese shipments to the US incurring levies exceeding 70 per cent, higher than the effective 57.5 per cent tariffs in place before Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinpingstruck a deal in Octoberto de-escalate their trade war. It remains unclear which countries with Iranian business links Mr Trump might target, and he has not named China. The US president has also made offhand remarks that threatened to upend US foreign policy without acting on them before. China will call (Mr Trumps) bluff. I can assure you that Trump has no guts to impose the extra 25 per cent tariffs on China, and if he does, China will retaliate and he will be punished, said Professor Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, just like in Meng Wenzhous case. China and Iran are not as close as in the public imagination, said a Beijing-based Chinese academic who advises the foreign ministry on Iran policy, and requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media. China has sharply reduced Iranian imports in recent years, according to Chinese customs data, with Chinese companies wary of being sanctioned by the US government. China bought just US$2.9 billion of Iranian goods in the first 11 months of 2025, the latest customs figures show, compared with a peak of US$21 billion in 2018 during Mr Trumps first presidency. That said, Beijing moves around 80 per cent of Irans shipped oil through small independent refiners trading off the books to skirt US sanctions over the countrys nuclear ambitions. Chinas state-backed oil majors have not done any business with Iran since 2022. Some analysts say the independents shipments means the total value of Chinas purchases remains in the tens of billions of dollars. China is just an excuse, a kind of disguise for the Trump administration, to impose new pressure (on) Iran, said Mr Wang Jin at the Beijing Club for International Dialogue think-tank. When asked at a regular press conference on Jan 13 about Mr Trumps tariff threat, Chinas foreign ministry said that Beijing would resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. Still, Iran remains substantially bigger business for China than Venezuela, where Mr Trump acted to curb Beijings stake witha commando raid to capture President Nicolas Maduroto face drug charges in the United States. Analysts said Mr Trumps renewed push to cut off Iran from global trade flows is likely to deepen scrutiny of Mr Xis flagship Belt and Road Initiative, where Iran is a strategic hub for the passage of Chinese goods to the Middle East. It also raises uncertainty over whether Mr Trump willvisit Beijing in Aprilas expected, with analysts anticipating the announcement of a sweeping trade agreement with Mr Xi. Whether Trumps tariffs are enforceable remains a question, said Mr Xu Tianchen, a Beijing-based analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Last year, he announced tariffs related to illicit Russian oil trade, but their implementation was patchy. Trump is also the kind of person who likes bullying the weak, Mr Xu said. He should manage his actions to avoid these tariffs escalating into direct confrontation with China. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/trumps-iran-tariff-threat-risks-reopening-china-rift

Yoon triggered a political crisis when heannounced an end to civilian rule in December 2024and sent troops to Parliament to enforce it. But his attempt failed and he became the countrys first sitting president to be taken into custody when he wasdetained last January. Yoons criminal trial for insurrection, abuse of power and other offences linked to the declaration drew to a close on Jan 13 after 11 hours of proceedings. In closing remarks, prosecutors accused him of being the ringleader of an insurrection motivated by a lust for power aimed at dictatorship and long-term rule. They accused Yoon of showing no remorse for actions which threatened constitutional order and democracy. The greatest victims of the insurrection in this case are the people of this country, they said. There are no mitigating circumstances to be considered in sentencing, and instead a severe punishment must be imposed. Yoons defence team, meanwhile, have made theatrical arguments in a bid to help him and his alleged accomplices. On Jan 13, they compared the disgraced former leader to great historic figures like Italian scholars Galileo Galilei and Giordano Bruno who were wrongfully condemned. The majority does not always reveal the truth, they said. Prosecutors also asked that former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun be sentenced to life imprisonment. Proceedings were expected to wrap up on Jan 9 but were postponed after 15 hours of deliberation – it took eight hours to examine evidence alone for Kim. Kims lawyer insisted a short tongue was preventing him from reading more quickly. The current trial features eight defendants seen as ringleaders of the martial law bid, including Yoon and Kim. If found guilty, Yoon will become the third South Korean president convicted for insurrection, alongside two military leaders in connection with a 1979 coup. Even if he is convicted and sentenced to death, it is highly unlikely it would be carried out as South Korea has had an unofficial moratorium on executions since 1997. Prosecutors are alsoseeking a 10-year prison term for Yoonon obstruction of justice charges, with a Seoul court expected to deliver a verdict in that case on Jan 16. And he faces a trial on charges of aiding the enemy over allegations he ordered drone flights over North Korea to strengthen his effort to declare martial law.

India Hate Lab documented 1,318 instances of what it called hate speech in 2025, up from 1,165 in 2024 and 668 in 2023, at events such as political rallies, religious processions, protest marches and cultural gatherings. Of that number, 1,164 incidents occurred in states and union territories governed by the BJP, either directly or with coalition political parties, the group said. The Indian embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Modi and his party deny being discriminatory and say their policies, including food subsidy programs and electrification drives, benefit all communities. April recorded the highest monthly spike, 158 events, with nearly 100 occurring between April 22, after a deadly Islamist militant attack in India-administered Kashmir, and May 7, when four days of deadly fighting broke out between India and Pakistan. Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say abuse of minorities has risen in India since Modi took office in 2014, pointing to a religion-based citizenship law the UN calls fundamentally discriminatory, anti-conversion legislation that challenges freedom of belief, the 2019 removal of Muslim-majority Kashmirs special status, and the demolition of Muslim-owned properties. India Hate Lab, founded by U.S.-based Kashmiri journalist Raqib Hameed Naik, is a project of the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, a nonprofit Washington-based think tank. The BJP has previously said India Hate Lab presents a biased picture of India. India Hate Lab says it uses the UNs definition of hate speech, which defines it as prejudiced or discriminatory language towards an individual or group based on attributes including religion, ethnicity, nationality, race or gender.

The decline came after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichis remarks in November on Japans potential response to a Taiwan emergency angered China and prompted an immediate backlash. Beijing advised its citizens to avoid visiting Japan in response. The 48 per cent year-on-year drop in the number of people travelling from Kansai International Airport to China was recorded between Dec 26 and Jan 4, according to preliminary data from the Kansai airport branch of the local immigration office in Osaka.

South Korea was the most popular destination with 127,990 travellers, followed by Taiwan with 59,970. China, which topped the list in 2025, fell to third place. The operator of the airport, Kansai Airports, said the number of flights to and from China in December fell to 2,286, or about 60 per cent of what it was a year earlier.

Prince Group founder and chairmanChen Zhi was extradited to Chinafrom Cambodia last week, both governments said. The United States indicted the Chinese-born businessman in October, alleging hedirected online investment schemes that have netted billionsand were run by hundreds of scammers trafficked into compounds in Cambodia. Four Prince Group properties in the capital Phnom Penh and one in the coastal city of Sihanoukville were suspended from further sales of condo units and homes in gated communities, Cambodias real estate regulator said in a statement late on Jan 12. The announcement is the latest blow to Prince Group – a multinational conglomerate that US authorities say served as a front for one of Asias largest transnational criminal organisations – after Chen was charged, and his company was sanctioned by Washington and London in October. The real estate regulator said individuals who have signed sales contracts for units at any of the five properties were obligated to complete the agreed purchase. Those who have paid in full have the option to sell their property, after registering ownership with the government, an official at the regulator said. At one of the Prince complexes in the capital, The Pinnacle Residence condominiums – also known as Prince Happiness Plaza, according to the regulator – several employees told AFP on Jan 13 that the sales office had been closed. One employee who declined to give his name said the sales team had been scaling down since October. I dont know what is happening and I hope it wont affect my job, he said. The shimmering 47-floor towers of the residential and business complex were completed in 2024 and 75 per cent of its nearly 1,800 units were sold, according to Cambodia property website realestate.com.kh The developer is listed as Prince Real Estate Cambodia, another entity under US sanctions. Chen was charged by US authorities with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges involving approximately 127,271 seized Bitcoins, worth more than US$11 billion (S$14.1 billion) at current prices. Since then, authorities in Europe, the United States and Asia have targeted Prince Group with a frenzy of asset confiscations. Cambodias central bank placed another one of its companies, the US-sanctioned Prince Bank, into liquidation last week. Prince Group has denied the allegations.

Canada, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but the economic and political exchanges between the two sides have increased as Beijing ratchets up military threats against the democratic island. Still, two lawmakers from Carneys Liberal Party this week ended a visit early to Taiwan citing advice from the Canadian government and to avoid confusion with Canadas foreign policy before Carney visits Beijing from Wednesday. LAI OUTLINES PROGRESS IN TIES Meeting the three remaining members of the delegation, from the opposition Conservative Party, Lai said that over the past three years, Taiwan and Canada have made substantive progress in areas such as trade and technology, including 2023s signing of a landmark investment agreement. Bilateral relations continue to deepen and yield fruitful results, Lai said at the presidential office in Taipei. He also expressed appreciation for the Canadian governments public concern over last months Chinese war games around Taiwan. I would like to thank the Canadian government for soon releasing a statement expressing its concern and opposing any unilateral attempt to change the status quo, he added. This once again demonstrated that maintaining the peaceful and stable status quo across the Taiwan Strait is not only in the interest of all parties, but also the international consensus. Canadian warships on occasion sail through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, to Beijings anger, which happened most recently last September. Lai made no mention of Carneys visit to China in front of media. Melissa Lantsman, deputy co-leader of Canadas Conservatives, told Lai that Taiwan was a trusted partner. We are here with a clear and sincere purpose to say to Taiwan and the people of Taiwan that you have friends in Canadas parliament, she said. Taiwans foreign ministry earlier on Tuesday played down the early departure of the two other lawmakers, saying the government will continue to further deepen exchanges and cooperation with Canada. Carney will discuss trade and international security while in China, at a time when Canada faces uncertain relations with the United States due to a trade war and annexation threats from President Donald Trump.

According to the regulations, the chips will be reviewed by a third-party testing lab to confirm their technical AI capabilities before they can be shipped to China, which cannot receive more than 50 per cent of the total amount of chips sold to American customers. Nvidia will need to certify there are enough H200s in the United States, while Chinese customers must demonstrate sufficient security procedures and cannot use the chips for military purposes. Nvidia and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.US President Donald Trump announced last month that he would allow the chip sales in exchange for a 25 per cent fee for the US government. The decision drew fire from China hawks across the US political spectrum over concerns the chips would supercharge Beijings military and erode the United States advantage in artificial intelligence. Such concerns had prompted the Biden administration to bar sales of advanced AI chips to China.But the Trump administration, led by White House AI czar David Sacks, argues that shipping advanced AI chips to China discourages Chinese competitors - such as heavily sanctioned Huawei - from redoubling efforts to catch up with Nvidia and AMDs most advanced chip designs.When Mr Trump announced the sales last month, he said they would be exported to China under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security.But questions have arisen around whether the administration would in practice impose any limits on the chip shipments, or even if Beijing would allow their sales domestically. Reuters reported last month that the US had launched a review that could result in the first shipments of the chips to China.

Rodriguez, the president of the National Assembly, and U.S. President Donald Trump both said last week that large numbers of prisoners would be released as a peace gesture after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro. The release of people considered political prisoners by the opposition has been one of their long-standing demands. The Venezuelan government has always denied it holds people for political reasons and has said it has already released most of the 2,000 people detained after protests over the contested 2024 election. The decision to release some prisoners, not political prisoners, but some politicians who had broken the law and violated the Constitution, people who called for invasion, was granted, Rodriguez said during a parliamentary session on Tuesday, adding that this was intended to promote peaceful coexistence. Over 400 had been released, he said, without giving a specific timeline. Local NGOs have said that the number of prisoners freed since Thursday ranges between 60 and 70, and have denounced a slow pace and lack of information surrounding the releases. On Monday, Venezuelas penitentiary authority had said that 116 people had been freed. Foro Penal, a leading local NGO that works on legal support for detainees, said at least 800 political prisoners were behind bars at the beginning of this year. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who is expected to meet with Trump on Thursday, has been one of the leading voices demanding the release of prisoners, some of whom are her close allies.

U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns during a hearing in Boston raised that prospect as a practical solution to how to resolve a lawsuit by Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19-year-old student at Babson College who was sent to Honduras in violation of a court order. Lopez Belloza, who was brought to the U.S. from Honduras by her parents when she was 8, was arrested on November 20 based on a removal order she says she did not know existed. Her lawyer filed a lawsuit challenging her detention the next day. A federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order on November 21 barring Lopez Belloza from being deported or transferred out of Massachusetts for 72 hours. But by that time, Lopez Belloza had already been flown to Texas, potentially stripping Stearns court of jurisdiction. She was flown to Honduras on November 22. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter acknowledged the courts order was violated, a development he blamed on a mistake by an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement who thought the order no longer applied and failed to properly flag it. On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologize, Sauter said. He said there were no grounds to hold anyone in contempt, however. He called it a rare instance of the government not following an order in the over 700 cases filed in Massachusetts by migrants challenging their detention since President Donald Trump took office last year with a hardline immigration agenda. Stearns, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, commended Sauter for acknowledging the mistake and asked what the remedy should be, saying we dont want to lose sight that we have a real human being here. Todd Pomerleau, Lopez Bellozas lawyer, urged Stearns to order the government to facilitate the return of his client and to hold officials in contempt. The rule of law ought to matter, Pomerleau said. Stearns did not immediately rule. But he floated an alternative, recommending the State Department issue Lopez Belloza a student visa allowing her to finish her studies. We all recognize a mistake was made, Stearns said. Shes a very sympathetic person, and there should be some means to addressing this.

In his speech, he reiterated a message he had posted earlier on social media, thathelp is on its wayfor the Iranian protesters. He also said it was unclear what the death toll in Iran actually was. I hear numbers – look, one death is too much – but I hear much lower numbers, and then I hear much higher numbers, he said. Later, speaking to reporters on his return to Washington, Mr Trump said he would soon be receiving a briefing on Iran. The killing looks like its significant, but we dont know yet for certain. Ill know within 20 minutes – and well act accordingly, he said. Mr Trump had previously vowed the United States would get involved if protesters were killed, a line crossed days ago. At least 734 people are confirmed to have been killed, though the actual death toll is likely in the thousands, Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said on Jan 13. Fears have also grown that the Islamic republic could use the death penalty to crack down on the protests, after Tehran prosecutors said authorities would press capital charges of moharebeh, or waging war against God, against some suspects arrested over recent demonstrations. Concerns are mounting that authorities will once again resort to swift trials and arbitrary executions to crush and deter dissent, Amnesty International said. IHR highlighted the case of Erfan Soltani, 26, who was arrested last week in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj and who, according to a family source, has already been sentenced to death and is due to be executed as early as Jan 14.

Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences, the Clintons wrote in a letter to Republican Representative James Comer, who chairs the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. For us, now is that time. Mr Comer said the committee will meet next week to hold former Democratic president Clinton in contempt. That could potentially lead to criminal charges. A committee spokesperson said the panel will also begin contempt proceedings against Mrs Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, if she does not appear before the panel on Jan 14. The Clintons said they had tried to provide what little information they had to help with the investigation and accused Mr Comer of shifting focus away from the Trump administrations actions.Epstein died in jail in 2019, during President Donald Trumps first term in office, while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. If the Government didnt do all it could to investigate and prosecute these crimes, for whatever reason, that should be the focus of your work... There is no evidence that you are doing so, the Clintons wrote. There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics, they said. Mr Comer said most Americans want Mr Clinton to answer questions about his ties to Epstein. The Kentucky Republican said Epstein visited the White House 17 times while Mr Clinton was in office and that the former president had flown on Epsteins plane some 27 times. Mr Clinton has expressed regret about the relationship and has said he knew nothing about Epsteins criminal activity. No evidence has surfaced that Mr Clinton was involved in sex trafficking. No ones accusing Bill Clinton of any wrongdoing, Mr Comer said. We just have questions. The US Justice Department has been releasing files tied to criminal probes of Epstein, who was once friends with Mr Trump and the Clintons, in compliance with a transparency law passed by Congress. A separate letter sent to the committee on Jan 12 by the Clintons attorneys said the subpoenas for their testimony were invalid, unenforceable and nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed.

In an interview from last week published by the New York Times, Mr Trump said he believed civil rights-era protections resulted in white people being treated unfairly. White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university to college, the newspaper quoted Mr Trump as saying in an apparent reference to affirmative action in college admissions. The comments came after Mr Trump was asked whether protections that began in the 1960s with passage of the Civil Rights Act resulted in discrimination against white men, according to the newspaper. It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people - people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job, Mr Trump was quoted as saying. It was a reverse discrimination. NAACP President Derrick Johnson denounced the comments. Donald Trump knows he is lying through his teeth. The issue isnt that he is unaware of the history or lacks education, its that deception is the point, Mr Johnson said in a statement. There is zero evidence, none, that the civil rights movement harmed white people in any way, Mr Johnson added. Trump does this all the time. He deliberately invents a false reality to lay the groundwork for policies that further benefit the top one percent by privatising government services and stripping resources away from underserved communities. Mr Trump has been criticised by rights groups over his immigration crackdown, assault on diversity initiatives, funding freeze against universities over pro-Palestinian protests and attacks against cultural institutions for focusing on issues like slavery. Mr Trump cites security reasons for his immigration crackdown and says he is fighting against what he calls anti-American views.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein","['Donald Trump', 'Trade', 'United States']","DETROIT, Michigan, Jan 13 - President Donald Trump touted his economic record in Detroit on Tuesday, aiming to refocus attention on U.S. manufacturing and his efforts to tackle high consumer costs as the White House strives to show it is addressing the economic anxieties gripping U.S. households. In remarks to the Detroit Economic Club, Trump boasted that he had rebuilt the U.S. economy in the span of 11 months. His sprawling speech was marked by his typical stream-of-consciousness discursions. Growth is exploding, productivity is soaring, investment is booming, incomes are rising, he said. Inflation is defeated. America is respected again like never before. However, consumer prices rose last month, driven by higher food and rent costs, and job growth has been sluggish. Affordability remains a top concern for voters: the presidents approval on cost-of-living issues was just 27%, a Reuters/Ipsos poll in December found. Some White House aides have urged the president to prioritize domestic concerns as his Republican Party faces a tough battle to maintain control of Congress in Novembers midterm elections. Tuesdays visit to the heart of Americas auto industry follows weeks of global saber-rattling by Trump, including forcing out Venezuelas president, threats to Iran and Cuba, warnings to Russia and China and even a challenge to Denmark over Greenland. DETROIT AUTOS Trumps trip coincided with the Detroit Auto Show, where this week the Motor Citys Big Three automakers - Ford, General Motors and Stellantis - will showcase their latest innovations. But the backdrop is grim: Factory employment fell nationwide by 8,000 jobs in December, dipping below levels seen during much of Trumps first term and despite Trumps pledge that his aggressive import taxes would lead to a manufacturing renaissance. Trump on Tuesday repeated his assertion that tariffs were prompting a wave of new auto factories, although there is little evidence of a construction boom. Now we have more plants being built in our country than at any time in history, Trump told reporters ahead of touring a Ford production center in Dearborn. He also said he was indifferent to the idea of renegotiating the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, which he called irrelevant. You know, we dont need cars made in Canada, he added. We dont need cars made in Mexico. We want to make them here. U.S. automakers have urged Trump to extend the free trade agreement, which is set to go through a formal review this year, saying they need parts sourced from Mexico and Canada to manufacture vehicles in the United States. Trump was accompanied by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Executive Chairman Bill Ford, along with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as he walked through the center where the automaker assembles the bestselling F-150 pickup truck. Auto executives spent much of 2025 scrambling to react to the presidents on-again, off-again tariffs, which have cost the companies billions of dollars. Carmakers also have navigated the knock-on effects of Trumps trade wars, including Chinas retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth magnets, used extensively in cars. MORE TRAVEL TO COME Trump will travel around the country this year to speak directly to voters about his economic accomplishments ahead of the midterm elections, aides have said, after Democrats swept several high-profile state races in 2025. But his speech on Tuesday, billed as being focused on the economy, whipsawed from one topic to another, including immigration, former President Joe Biden, transgender athletes and Venezuela. In recent days, Trump has targeted some of the largest U.S. industries with economic-focused moves that shook markets but lack legislative backing. He pressed credit card companies to temporarily cut interest rates, announced a ban on Wall Street purchases of single-family homes and pressured global oil companies to boost Venezuelan crude output, which would increase global oil supply and potentially bring down prices for consumers in the coming years. Michigan is a key political battleground ahead of the 2026 midterms, with an open U.S. Senate seat and several competitive House of Representatives races. Trump carried the state twice, although Michigan voters also elected Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

The US military and Coast Guard have seized five vessels in recent weeks in international waters that were either carrying Venezuelan oil or have done so in the past. The seizures were part of Washingtons campaign to force former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power that culminated in US forces capturing him on Jan 3. Since then, the administration of President Donald Trump has said it plans to control Venezuelas oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the countrys dilapidated oil industry. Mr Trump imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil in December 2025 that brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have resumed this week under US supervision. The US government has filed multiple civil forfeiture actions in district courts, primarily in Washington, DC, enabling the seizure and confiscation of oil cargoes and ships that have been involved in the trade, the sources told Reuters. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The exact number of seizure warrants the US has filed for, and how many it has already received, is unclear, the sources said, because the filings and legal orders are not public. Dozens have been filed, they added. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The vessels already intercepted were either under US sanctions or part of a shadow fleet of unregulated ships that disguise their origins to move oil from key sanctioned producers Iran, Russia or Venezuela. There are still many tankers at sea carrying Venezuelan crude to top buyer China, or that have previously done so. The US has imposed sanctions on many of those vessels for facilitating oil trade with Venezuela or Iran. There has been a pause in US action to seize vessels since Jan 9, the sources said. Action could resume against vessels and cargoes not authorised by the US, they said. The Department of Defence, together with other US agencies, would hunt down and interdict ALL dark fleet vessels transporting Venezuelan oil at the time and place of our choosing, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Jan 9 on X. The United States has targeted both the vessels and the cargoes on them in recent seizures. That is an escalation from previous seizures of Iranian cargoes between 2020 and 2023, shipping industry sources said. In those earlier cases, US law enforcers confiscated the oil cargo but not the vessel itself. The Department of Justice was monitoring several other vessels for similar enforcement action, US Attorney-General Pam Bondi said on social media on Jan 7, after the seizure of the Bella-1 tanker, which was empty of any cargo and the first time in recent memory that the US military has seized a Russian-flagged vessel. Russia, like Venezuela, relies on the shadow fleet to carry oil that is under sanctions. Russias Foreign Ministry described the action as the illegal use of force by the US military, adding that the application of US sanctions was without legal foundation.

Forum: What long-term housing options are there for adults with autism?,"Jan 14, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 14, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Autism', 'Public housing']","My son was born in 1998 and is on the autism spectrum. He has very limited speech and cannot be left alone, but physically he is able to manage some activities of daily living with supervision. Like many adults with autism, he does not require institutional care, yet he cannot live fully independently without structure, familiarity and timely support. While Singapore promotes ageing-in-place and an inclusive society, living in a regular Housing Board environment can be challenging for adults with autism. My son has significant sensory sensitivities, particularly to high-pitched sounds such as baby cries. When exposed to such triggers, he becomes distressed and has difficulty regulating his behaviour. Out of consideration for our neighbours, we keep our doors and windows closed and limit his activities within the flat. As a result, he spends most of his time indoors, socially isolated– not because he chooses to be, but because the environment is not suited to his needs. Many families in similar situations try hard to be responsible neighbours, yet standard housing environments are often not designed with neurodiversity in mind. As parents age, the question of long-term housing becomes increasingly urgent. Under current HDB rules, a single person may buy a flat only from age 35. For those with autism, this timeline may be too late. Adapting to a new environment often requires many years of gradual exposure, training and familiarisation. A sudden transition later in life can be distressing and difficult to sustain. One possible way forward would be to explore a housing model for adults with special needs similar in concept to the Community Care Apartments for seniors. Such housing could consist of small, purpose-built apartments purchased by families, with access to support and environments designed to reduce sensory overload. This would not only support independent living, but also help build a more inclusive society where adults with special needs can live with dignity, safety and community acceptance.

Whatever the justifications the US may advance, this is an unmistakable display and useof overwhelming military strength against a weaker sovereign state. It would be disingenuous not to acknowledge the US formidable military capabilities. Few nations possess the organisational capability to plan and execute such an audacious operation flawlessly. This is also the second time the US has acted in a similar vein, after arresting Panamas ruler Manuel Noriega in 1990. It indicates that future similar acts cannot be ruled out, and are even perhaps probable given the recent rhetoric from Washington regarding Greenland, Colombia and Iran. This incident highlights the vulnerability of small nations with little leverage to fight against the rich and powerful ones. If the US can undertake such a mission seemingly with impunity, what is there topreventother powerful nations from doing the same? I suppose small, powerless nations have to be realistic and accept the law of the jungle in this ruthless world where every nation has to look out for its own survival, just like its every man for himself in most societal situations.

The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) takes a whole-of-society approach, involving the public, businesses and community organisations, to enable seniors, including persons living with dementia, to move about safely and independently. One such initiative is the Dementia Go-To Points (GTPs) located at MRT stations, bus interchanges, community centres, eldercare services and retail partners. GTPs serve as accessible touchpoints in the community, where front-line staff are trained to assist seniors, and persons living with dementia who appear lost and disoriented, by providing them support and helping them to reunite with their families or caregivers. There are over 800 GTPs islandwide today. To enable quicker community responses in locating lost persons living with dementia, the public may use Dementia Singapores CARA app, which alerts users to missing persons in their vicinity. AIC continues to strengthen public awareness so that seniors, including persons living with dementia, can navigate public spaces safely. This includes expanding community training, providing useful resources for caregivers and guidance for the public on assisting seniors who appear lost or disoriented, and supporting partners in adopting clearer wayfinding signs in the community. Members of the public may visitwww.aic.sgto learn more about available dementia support and resources.

There was no immediate response to emails seeking comment, sent by Reuters to representatives of Iglesias, 82. The stars record label, Sony, declined to comment. The women, said to have worked in Iglesias Caribbean residences in the Dominican Republic and Bahamas over a 10-month period in 2021, were cited in a three-year investigation by US broadcaster Univision and Spanish outletelDiario.espublished on Jan 13. Both women reported suffering sexual assault and workplace harassment while working for the singer, the outlets reported. The reports said Iglesias pressured them into sexual encounters and subjected them to additional physical and verbal abuse. The prosecutors office said it had opened preliminary proceedings after a claim was filed on Jan 5. Details of the case were covered by secrecy rules that prevented it from providing further information. Iglesias is one of the worlds best-selling Latin artists, with more than 300 million records sold in 14 languages. A former aspiring soccer player, he turned to music after a 1963 car accident ended his sports career. The allegations sparked a noisy reaction in Spain, where he is considered a national treasure. Ana Redondo, the Socialist-led governments Equality Minister, said in a statement she respected Iglesias presumption of innocence but that she believed the womens testimony. Hes a great singer but people can have a dark side, she said, praising the women for raising their complaints. Leftist party Mas Madrid suggested the right-wing government of Madrid region should strip Iglesias of the keys to the city he was awarded as the capitals most famous son. Iglesias has backed conservative political candidates in the past. Regional president Isabel Diaz Ayuso issued a furious response on X, saying: The Community of Madrid will never contribute to attacks on the prestige of artists, not least the most universal singer of all: Julio Iglesias.

The 50-year-old recounted the terrifying near-miss incident, along with a photo of her bathroom in her Singapore home, on her Instagram Stories on Jan 10. The sudden explosion caused the shower head to burst out from the wall, Hsu wrote in Chinese. She added that if she had been standing in front of the fixture, she could have broken my ribs or injured my head. She said she was thankful the harrowing experience had happened to her and not to her son, aged 10. Hsu, a single mother who divorced Singapore-based businessman Sean Lee in 2023, shuttles between Taiwan for work and Singapore, where her only child is studying. She wrote: Thank God my son did not encounter this when he showered earlier at 10pm. Showering is supposed to be relaxing – a child would not have been able to react in time, and the consequences could have been terrifying. Her post ended with a reminder to everyone to be careful at home. This is not the first time the singer recounted a distressing experience in Singapore.

In an interview with Hong Kong media on Jan 12, the 75-year-old clarified that the assets went to his former wife. In 2023, Lee was asked about the fate of his properties following his divorce and why none were registered in his name. At the time, the actor explained that it would have been inconvenient to manage the properties himself as he was often travelling for work. I said, I transferred everything to her, and the media ran with the assumption that I was referring to Chris, he said. It was not the first time Lee has dismissed the rumours. The TVB star revealed in 2024 that Wong, 39, was fully aware the properties had been transferred to his former wife. In the recent interview, Lee also spoke abouthis split from Wong, saying he was heartbroken upon learning she was already married with a teenage son. Their relationship ended after Wong – whose real name is Wang Qingxia – was photographed dining with her husband and mother during a Winter Solstice dinner in Foshan on Dec 21, 2025. Such a huge blow; (this) is not something you can get over easily, but Ill try my best. I was with her for seven years and never noticed anything suspicious... Ive learnt my lesson now, he said. While initially angry and hurt, Lee said he came to understand the complexities of Wongs situation. He explained that Wongs husband played a significant role in her fathers business, so she could not easily set aside the marriage. Having spent many years together, Lee said he never doubted Wongs affection for him, adding that her reluctance to reveal the truth was out of fear of losing him. The former TVB star added he and Wong still contact each other occasionally. He said he still loves Wong, but as long as she remains married, he has no intention to rekindle their romance. Lee and Wong went public with their relationship in 2020. In June 2024, Wong – a Chinese national – was handed a prison sentence after pleading guilty to overstaying in Hong Kong and document falsification. Upon her release and deportation back to China in July 2025, Leepresented her with a bouquet of 60 rosesand pledged to support her. The former couple exchanged over 300 letters during Wongs incarceration.

"Know your vitamins D, E and K: Vitamin D lack in sunny Spore, vitamin K shots for babies","Jan 13, 2026, 02:00 PM","Jan 13, 2026, 02:12 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/56070dc76bfde9b295de1cc28cfc8ebf26457045feb2b3afe7ac16938d510520,Vitamin D is produced by the skin when it is exposed to sunlight.PHOTO: ADOBE STOCK,"['Living Well', 'Health and well-being', 'Nutrition and diet']","SINGAPORE – Why are many Singapore residents deficient in vitamin D? Will vitamin E boost yourskincare routine? Why are newborn babies in Singapore given an injection of vitamin K? In this second of a two-part series, we find out about these essential nutrients. What to eat:Eggs; fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and tuna; foods that have been fortified with vitamin D. Vitamin D supports the immune system, muscle function and bone health, since it regulates the amount of calcium in the body. It is commonly known as the sunshine vitamin because one of its two forms, vitamin D3, is produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. The other form, vitamin D2, is derived from plant sources and fortified foods, and is less effective at raising blood serum levels of vitamin D. Despite the sunny weather in Singapore, various studies on the local population over the years have shown that at least 30 per cent of those studied were deficient in vitamin D. A study by KK Womens and Childrens Hospital (KKH), published in 2024in the journal PLoS One, found that up to 90 per cent of the pregnant women studied had insufficient levels of vitamin D. The Health Promotion Boards (HPB)recommended dietary allowanceof vitamin D is 2.5mcg for adults aged 18 and above. Pregnant or breastfeeding women require 10mcg a day. Professor Jerry Chan, senior consultant at KKHs department of reproductive medicine, says that high awareness of sun protection could be the reason many in Singapore have insufficient vitamin D. Many people frequently use sun shields and covered clothes, as well as lead indoor and sedentary lifestyles, he says. Our expectant mothers tend to stay indoors and use sun protection outdoors. Expertsrecommend 15 to 30 minutes of sun exposure, but people with darker or tanned skin might require more, as the melanin in the skin reduces the vitamin-producing effect of ultraviolet radiation. Dr Glenn Low, a physician at private practice DTAP Clinic, says another reason for vitamin D deficiency could be an unbalanced diet. Eggs and fatty fish are the main sources of this vitamin. Dairy and plant-based products normally contain very little vitamin D, and typically need to be fortified with it, he says. Prof Chan, who is also director of the KKH Maternal and Child Health Research Institute, says pregnant women need an adequate amount of vitamin D to reduce the risk of complications in pregnancies such as pre-term birth and low birth weight in infants. All pregnant patients at KKH, as well as those who intend to conceive, are prescribed multivitamins that include vitamin D, as well as vitamin B. Deficiencies in both vitamins are prevalent in the Singapore population. Dr Rachel Chin, a general practitioner at DA MedSuites, says vitamin D deficiency results in bones becoming weak or soft. In children, this condition, called rickets, will affect bone development and increase the risk of fractures. Adults are at risk of developing osteoporosis or brittle bones, as well as impaired immune function and muscle weakness. Dr Chin says that bone-softening conditions like rickets, or osteomalacia in adults, can be reversed with vitamin D and calcium supplementation. However, it takes time, often months, to restore bone mineral density. The earlier the supplementation starts, the better the long-term prognosis, she says. Dr Chin adds that vitamin D is fat-soluble and stored in the body. Taking excessive supplements of vitamin D can lead to a build-up of calcium in the blood, or hypercalcaemia. Hypercalcaemia can cause nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst and urination. It can also lead to kidney stones and kidney damage. People often assume that because they live in a sunny place but are deficient, they need extremely high doses, which is incorrect and risky, says Dr Chin. Before starting any high-dose vitamin D regimen, it is crucial to establish a baseline blood level. What to eat:Fortified cereals, green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, vegetable oils. Ms Sharon Teoh, dietitian at Singapore General Hospital, calls vitamin E a potent antioxidant. It protects cells from the damage caused by free radicals. It is important for nerve and muscle function, and also immune health. Moisturisers and other skincare products often advertise vitamin E as an ingredient. Dermatologists say that applying creams with vitamin E could help support the skin barrier, or protective outer layer of skin, at the site of application. However, topical application does not make vitamin E available to the rest of the body. DTAP Clinics Dr Low says this is because the skin itself functions as a barrier to prevent substances from entering the bloodstream. Ms Teoh says most people get enough vitamin E for their needs from natural food sources, by eating a varied and balanced diet. Vitamin E deficiency is very rare, she adds. HPB does not have a recommended dietary allowance for vitamin E, but United States authorities recommend 15mg daily for most adults, while breastfeeding women are recommended 19mg daily. In Singapore, the Health Sciences Authority specifies an upper limit of 536mg in vitamin E supplements. Ms Teoh says that excessive vitamin E increases the risk of bleeding, especially in people taking blood thinners. She adds that vitamin E is fat-soluble and deficiencies can manifest in people with medical conditions that affect fat absorption. People at risk include those with chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency and Crohns disease, an inflammatory bowel disease where the digestive tract is inflamed. Premature and low-birth-weight infants are among the highest-risk groups, adds Ms Teoh. The placenta does not transfer sufficient vitamin E to the foetus before birth, and so infants have low stores. They may develop haemolytic anaemia or have fragile red blood cells. These conditions are generally reversible with vitamin E therapy. When vitamin E deficiency does occur, it can lead to a weakened immune system and slower wound healing. People may experience muscle weakness, poor coordination or difficulty walking. Vision problems can also develop. Without vitamin Es antioxidant protection, retinal cells break down and blood vessels become damaged, leading to progressive visual loss, says Ms Teoh. These symptoms may improve if treated early. Severe damage can be permanent. What to eat:Asparagus, celery and leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale and broccoli. Newborns at KKH get an intramuscular injection of vitamin K in their first few hours of life. This is to prevent neonatal haemorrhagic disease, a bleeding disorder caused by vitamin K deficiency. Dr Nirmal Kavalloor Visruthan, head of KKHs Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at its department of neonatology, says newborns naturally have low levels of vitamin K. Vitamin K does not pass effectively from mother to baby via the placenta. Therefore, newborns have vitamin K deficiency at birth even if the mother takes vitamin K supplements during pregnancy, he says. Their gut takes several weeks to months to develop the bacteria needed to produce it, and breast milk contains limited amounts, he adds. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting, so supplementation at birth helps prevent serious bleeding complications. Vitamin K is required for blood clotting, bone health and cardiovascular function, says Ms Teoh from SGH. HPB does not have a recommended dietary allowance for vitamin K, but the US recommends 90mcg for women and 120 mcg for men, she adds. HSA has an upper limit of 120mcg for vitamin K in oral multivitamins for adults. Ms Teoh says toxicity from vitamin K is very rare, but the nutrient can interfere with the effects of anticoagulant medications. People on the blood thinner warfarin are often referred to a dietitian to ensure that their vitamin K intake remains consistent, she adds. Patients may start limiting their diets after being prescribed the blood thinner. Some try to avoid vegetables such as spinach, for example. We tell them that they dont need to change their diets. They have to keep their diet consistent so that their dietary vitamin K is consistent, she says.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/know-your-vitamins-d-e-and-k-vitamin-d-lack-in-sunny-spore-vitamin-k-shots-for-babies

Helping to limit the days decline, a report early in the day showed that a reading on US inflation for December came in as expected, leaving intact market expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. Mr Trumpsproposed 10 per cent cap on credit-card interest rateswould directly hurt financial companies profits, and top JPMorgan executives including chief executive officer Jamie Dimon warned that Mr Trumps plan would also severely hurt consumers. That extended this weeks selloff in financials over the proposal, which Mr Trump made on Jan 9. Shares of Visa fell 4.5 per cent, Mastercard dropped 3.8 per cent and the financial sector fell 1.8 per cent, leading declines in the S&P 500. Shares of JPMorgan ended down 4.2 per cent. The bank reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit but also a drop in investment banking fees. Financials are getting hit by Trumps credit-card proposal, said Mr Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. It seems to be sinking in, he said. I think its going to be extremely difficult to have that become a reality, but its still out there. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398.21 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 49,191.99, the S&P 500 lost 13.53 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 6,963.74 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 24.03 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 23,709.87. Results from JPMorgan and other companies on Jan 13 also unofficially kicked off the fourth-quarter US earnings season. Other big banks, due to report their quarterly numbers later this week, were also lower even as analysts expected most banks to post stronger results for the last quarter of 2025. Delta Air Lines shares eased 2.4 per cent as the midpoint of its 2026 profit forecast fell short of analysts expectations. Earnings news overall for the reporting period will most likely be positive, said Mr Oliver Pursche, senior vice-president, adviser for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut, adding, I suspect there are going to be some upward revisions for 2026. The days declines, he said, most likely reflect a little bit of letting the air out of the balloon, after recent record highs. The Dow and S&P 500 both registered record closing highs on Jan 12. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.15-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 577 new highs and 77 new lows on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 2,068 stocks rose and 2,701 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.31-to-1 ratio. Volume on US exchanges was 18.68 billion shares, compared with the roughly 16.4 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

"Hot, not necessarily expensive and far from boring: Marriott regional boss on Spore tourism","Jan 14, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 14, 2026, 07:05 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/4ad52c3d660eae99d97a7b1c47fe1324cc9c1e7ad491e69ebbf8008467652425,Singapore is repositioning itself to draw higher-spending purposeful travellers.ST PHOTO: BRIAN TEO,"['CEO Insights', 'Tourist attractions', 'Singapore tourism', 'Hotels']","SINGAPORE - Singapore, often described by visitors as clean, efficient and safe, is also praised for its modern infrastructure and good food. But criticism has surfaced online after some Chinese tourists on lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu complained that the Republic istoo hot, too boring and too expensive, sparking debate over whether Singapore still excites travellers amid growing competition from other Asian cities. That criticism, however, overlooks how todays travellers – and Singapores tourism strategy – have evolved, Mr Rajeev Menon, Asia-Pacific president of Marriott International, told The Straits Times in an exclusive interview. While the city is undeniably hot, it need not be expensive or dull, with Singapore repositioning itself for a new generation of travellers who are more intentional about how and why they travel, and are willing to pay for deeper, more meaningful experiences beyond shopping and sightseeing. Since Covid-19, travellers have shifted decisively towards experience-driven trips, with credit card data and Marriotts loyalty member insights showing that spending on sustainable travel, dining and wellness has outpaced purchases of other goods. When people were locked down, they realised freedom and mobility mattered more than almost anything else. That mindset hasnt gone away, said Mr Menon, who is also a board member of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). While current visitor arrivals in Singapore remain slightly below the 2019 peak, tourism receipts have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. From January to October 2025, Singapore recorded 14.3 million international visitors, up 3 per cent from a year earlier. The STB expects full-year arrivals of 17 million to 18.5 million, while analysts project up to 19 million visitors in 2026, close to the pre-pandemic peak of 19.1 million in 2019. Visitors are also spending more, with tourism receipts surpassing pre-pandemic levels at $29.8 billion in 2024, 7.6 per cent higher than in 2019. The STB expects spending to reach between $29 billion and $30.5 billion in 2025. By 2040, it is aiming for as much as $50 billion in tourism receipts. The numbers are consistent with Singapores tourism strategy, which now focuses on attracting visitors who stay longer, spend more and engage more deeply with the city, rather than maximising arrival numbers. Under STBs Tourism 2040 road map, Singapore is positioning itself as a year-round global city destination anchored by experiences such as arts, history and culture, lifestyle events, gastronomy, wellness as well as business and sustainable travel. Luxury travellers, in particular, have driven growth in room revenue, especially those from Asia, underpinned by a rapidly expanding middle class in the region and a growing number of millionaires minted each week, Mr Menon noted. He added that Marriott, which already operates 22 hotel properties with around 6,200 rooms in Singapore, is lining up even more hotels here from its stable of 30 global brands to capture that demand. The key is having the right options available for each customer group, Mr Menon said. Marriott recently introduced for the first time in Singapore its Luxury Collection hotels, which focus on deeply local, high-end stays where the design, food and activities are tailored to the destinations culture and history. The latest was the opening of Frasers House in Bugis on Jan 7, marking Marriotts second Luxury Collection property in the Republic after the launch of The Laurus at Resorts World Sentosa on Oct 1, 2025. Launched in partnership with Singapores Frasers Hospitality, Frasers House draws inspiration from nearby cultural enclaves such as Kampong Gelam, Arab Street and the Bras Basah-Bugis arts district. Previously the InterContinental Singapore, the 406-room property is undergoing a phased renovation to preserve its architectural heritage and Peranakan-inspired design. The Luxury Collection adds to Marriotts existing stable of 14 brands in the Republic, comprising Edition, St Regis, Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, W Hotels, Sheraton, Marriott, Westin, Tribute Portfolio, Autograph Collection, Design Hotels, Four Points, Courtyard and Aloft. The group has six more properties with over 2,600 rooms in the pipeline, including Four Points by Sheraton Singapore in Jurong, and Varel Singapore, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel in Selegie Road Arts District. Both hotels will open in the first quarter of 2026. It will also open a Moxy property in Boat Quay in 2027. The new locations in places such as Jurong and Balestier are intentional and strategic, and are expected to tap new demand away from the traditional Orchard-Marina Bay area, Mr Menon said. This approach also aligns with Singapores broader plans to decentralise economic activity and develop its heartland districts, while giving visitors a different view and experience of the city beyond the usual landmarks. Another way Singapore has been able to attract visitors is by deliberately creating experiences that are unique to the city, such as the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix, major global concert tours by Taylor Swift and Blackpink, the Asia-Pacific premiere for the movie Wicked: For Good, and major sports events like the World Aquatics Championships and Singapore T100 triathlon. It also draws high-spending visitors in the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) segment. In the first half of 2025, Marriott recorded a 12.5 per cent increase in MICE-related bookings in Singapore. MICE travellers spend more than the average tourist, Mr Menon said. And if they enjoy the destination, they often come back with their families. Singapores mix of hawker culture and fine dining has been a major draw, especially for younger travellers who are more values-driven and experience-focused, often planning trips around dining alone. Theyll go to a city specifically to eat at top restaurants or bars. That wasnt a dominant trend 10 years ago. Now its mainstream, he said. So is Singapore hot? Of course, Mr Menon said, noting that the country sits near the Equator. But I wouldnt classify it as boring. Areas like Bugis showcase this point. That melting pot of cultures is something you only see when you walk the streets, and it deserves more attention. Nor does Singapore cater only to the ultra-wealthy. While the Republic is more expensive for tourists compared with most Asian cities owing to its strong currency and high costs, the question is whether it delivers the experiences todays travellers are seeking. In many ways, it does, said Mr Menon. If you play to your strengths, thats a better strategy than chasing volume.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/hot-yes-but-need-not-be-expensive-and-far-from-boring-marriotts-regional-boss-on-spore-tourism

Revenue jumped on outsized gains in equity trading, prime brokerage and wealth management, the sources said. The investment banking and capital markets divisions also regained momentum, with fees from stock sales and mergers approaching US$1 billion, the most in years, they added, asking not to be identified because the numbers are confidential. A media representative for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong declined to comment. The Asia record has set traders and bankers up for a robust bonus season. Overall, investment bankers got a 15 per cent to 20 per cent bump for the past year while traders and product specialists in the institutional equity division got more, with top performers seeing increases of at least 30 per cent, the sources said. High-performing managing directors across country banking and booming sectors, such as technology, are expected to receive total compensation including bonuses of US$2 million to US$2.5 million, the sources said. Average compensation of US$1 million to US$1.5 million represents a sharp contrast to 2024, the sources said, after about a fifth of managing directors received no bonuses that year. Morgan Stanley reported US$7.64 billion in revenue from Asia in 2024, accounting for about 12 per cent of the New York banks global total. That topped arch-rival Goldman Sachs Group for the third year in a row. Morgan Stanleys Asia head Gokul Laroia told Bloomberg in a rare interview in 2025 that he was eyeing US$10 billion in revenue within five years. Trading momentum in the final quarter helped the firm near its goal much sooner than that. Morgan Stanleys Asia revenue, which includes that from Japan and Australia, rose 29 per cent to US$7.27 billion for the nine months ended in September. The boon echoed a global revenue surge, with stock traders beating expectations as US President Donald Trumps policies kept markets on edge. The bank is slated to announce its 2025 earnings on Jan 15, joining several Wall Street firms releasing results this week. Despite a record year in Asia, Morgan Stanley cautioned against raising bonuses too sharply, aiming to smooth compensation.

The yen to Singdollar to spot exchange rate crossed the 123 level for the first time on Jan 13. The yen dropped to123.5 per Singdollar at 5.04pmin Singapore, 0.4 per cent lower than the previous days close. The Japanese currency, which fell 5.4 per cent against the Singapore dollar in 2025, has weakened another 1.3 per cent so far in 2026. Against the US dollar, the yen hit its weakest level since July 2024. The Japanese currency fell as much as 0.5 per cent to 158.91 per US dollar, surpassing the previous low of 158.87 in January 2025. The Nikkei share index, meanwhile, jumped as much as 3.6 per cent as local media said Ms Takaichi plans to dissolve Parliament when it reconvenes on Jan 23, setting up for a general election as soon as Feb 8. With her popularity running high, going to the polls would likely cement her authority and bring a second wind to the so-called Takaichi trade, which has helped fuel bond losses and a weak Japanese currency. The yen was the worst performer among its Group of 10 peers in 2025, gaining just 0.3 per cent against the dollar. Some yen watchers see the currency weakening to 160 per greenback or beyond by the end of 2026, driven by still-wide US-Japan yield gaps, negative real rates and persistent capital outflows. Japanese officials, including Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama, have stepped up warnings against what they describe as excessive and speculative FX moves. She and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shared concerns about the weakening yen during a bilateral meeting in Washington. The risk of an official intervention is also back in focus. The Ministry of Finance last intervened in the currency market on July 12, 2024, when the dollar-yen hit a high for the day of 159.45. It intervened three other times that year when daily highs were 161.76, 160.17 and 157.99. Officials have indicated they are more concerned by volatility and the pace of moves than specific levels. In Japan, intervention decisions are made by the Ministry of Finance and executed by the Bank of Japan through a handful of commercial banks.

The bourse discussed introducing the futures for countries including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the people said. Such futures allow investors to hedge their exposure to interest-rate swings by buying or selling bonds at a later date on exchanges. The discussions reflect the growing interest in the regions debt markets. Indian bonds have been joining global indexes over the past 1½ years, while Malaysian securities were investor favourites in 2025, delivering the strongest performance in emerging Asia. For bond futures to be successful, the underlying bonds must be liquid, and traders must be able to trade both futures and onshore bonds to maintain the relationship between the futures and the bonds, said Mr Rajeev De Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management. Traders will need the ability to short cash bonds, which is not always easy in some markets. For the proposed products, SGX discussed offering three-, five- and 10-year maturities per country, the people said. The futures would be settled in US dollars, with pricing based on average yield of a basket of no more than three sovereign bonds, they said. For India, the bonds most likely to be considered would fall under the so-called Fully Accessible Route framework, making them eligible for inclusion in global indexes, the people said. Overseas investors have poured US$21 billion (S$27 billion) into the nations sovereign bonds since they were added to JPMorgan Chases flagship index in June 2024, according to clearing house data. SGX aims to introduce the futures in the first half of 2026,potentially as early as the first quarter,the people said, adding that the discussions are preliminaryand details may change.

The company, which is the citys second semiconductor company listing in as many days, rose as much as 54 per cent to HK$248.80 as it started trading on Jan 13. It raised HK$4.68 billion (S$772 million) in an offering where shares were priced at HK$162 apiece, with the retail offer 542 times subscribed. GigaDevices Hong Kong debut comes amid memory-chip price gains driven by supply shortages, as global producers rush to meet surging needs for AI. It joins a flurry of Chinese tech listings, fuelled by Beijings push to foster local competitors to the likes of Nvidia and Micron Technology. Beijing-based GigaDevice mainly provides so-called niche memory chips. It was the worlds second-largest supplier of NOR flash memory for cars, industrial automation and networking in 2025, according to a listing document filed with the Hong Kong stock exchange, citing US consultancy Frost & Sullivan. It also sells microcontroller units, which can be found in applications from consumer electronics to energy storage tools. Many of its products are leading in the nation and even globally, and its client base is of high quality and secure, SDICS International Securities analyst Alex Wang wrote in a note. Its product mix will make it a beneficiary of AI devices, and its acquisitions are starting to bear fruit, he said. Investor reception has been strong for Chinas latest tech listings. Shanghai Biren Technologyhas more than doubled from its debut in Hong Kong two weeks agothrough Jan 12. Moore Threads Technology and MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai have surged about sixfold following their Shanghai listings in December 2025. GigaDevices Hong Kong listing price represented roughly a 45 per cent discount from its A shares, which closed at 261.83 yuan in Shanghai on Jan 12. That compares with the 18 per cent discount OmniVision Integrated Circuits Groups H shares hit versus its onshore peer following a Jan 12 debut, and around 35 per cent discount in Hua Hong Semiconductor. GigaDevice has close ties with ChangXin Memory Technologies, which has also begun an onshore listing process eyeing a raise of 29.5 billion yuan (S$5.4 billion). GigaDevices founder and chairman Zhu Yiming also serves as the chairman of ChangXin, and the company relies on ChangXin to manufacture some of its chips. The company reported profit of 588 million yuan in the first half of 2025, an increase of 14 per cent from the previous period, according to the prospectus. It attributed the improvement to recovering price trends in memory chips, noting that its financial performance is susceptible to the cyclical price moves in the semiconductor industry.

REUTERS/Daniel Cole/File Photo","['World Cup', 'Swimming']","INGLEWOOD, California, Jan 13 - SoFi Stadium was built as the NFLs gleaming new palace, but over the next three years it is set to become a global sporting stage - a venue that will flip from World Cup spotlight to Super Bowl host to Olympic spectacle and swimming venue. Billionaire real estate magnate Stan Kroenke is the driving force behind the $5 billion stadium in Inglewood, which opened in 2020 and is home to the NFLs Rams, which Kroenke also owns, and Los Angeles Chargers. SoFi has already staged mega events including the Super Bowl in 2022 and six sold-out nights of Taylor Swifts Eras Tour in 2023. Officials said ambition was always baked into the footprint. When we first started talking about building SoFi Stadium in Hollywood Park, Stan Kroenke wanted to host the worlds greatest events, Kevin Demoff, president of team and media operations for Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, said in an interview at the stadium. We thought that would include Super Bowls, World Cups, hopefully the Olympics when we were dreaming this up in 2015, 2016. Now if you had said that they would happen in three consecutive years, maybe that would have been hard pressed to believe. I dont think any stadium has ever hosted all three, let alone three in consecutive years. At roughly 3.1 million square feet, SoFi is the largest stadium in the NFL, a scale Demoff said was deliberate - not just to dazzle on Sundays, but to morph, repeatedly, into whatever the sports calendar demands. It can be a great concert venue, a great football venue, or a great World Cup venue. It can host something incredible like swimming or the opening ceremony. WORLD CUP That flexibility is about to be stress-tested in sequence. This summer, SoFi is scheduled to host eight World Cup matches, including the U.S. opener and a quarter-final. For the World Cup, the transformation will involve turning an NFL stadium built with artificial turf and around sightlines for American football into a FIFA-sized soccer venue with grass. On a tour of the field, Otto Benedict, senior vice president of facility operations, said SoFi will remove about 400 seats from pre-built demountable sections and raise the playing surface roughly 30 inches using a substructure that creates airflow beneath a pitch. The stadium will install cool-season hybrid grass grown in Washington state and delivered in refrigerated trucks. The venue will seat about 74,000 fans under its translucent roof for World Cup matches. Its a limitless building, Benedict said. OLYMPIC SWIMMING In 2027, it will host Super Bowl LXI, and in 2028, the venue is slated for the Los Angeles Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. And then, in one of the more audacious pieces of the LA28 plan, Olympic swimming. If you had asked me when we built this, did I ever envision swimming being in SoFi Stadium in the Olympics? I would have said no, Demoff said. He said the idea began to circulate around 2020 or 2021, and that U.S. Swimming Trials staged in Indianapolis Lucas Oil Stadium ahead of the Paris Games helped demonstrate that a football building could credibly become a natatorium. The idea that where youre going to see players catching touchdowns today, or the U.S. score their opening goal of the World Cup, could also be where Katie Ledecky or someone else is swimming during the Olympics is a crazy thought, Demoff said. INFINITY SCREEN One of the most stunning features of the stadium is the 70,000-square-foot, dual-sided oval Infinity Screen, a massive 360-degree central video display, the largest of its kind in the world. More than 120 feet above the field, Josh Mark, the stadiums vice president of broadcast operations and production, shows off the buzzing control room, where about 50 people work on NFL game days with roughly 100 crew members overall operating cameras and multiple backup systems, he said. Working one of the events we have coming would be a career highlight and were getting three in the next three years, he said. We have a great crew for it. Demoff said the legacy he wants is not just the list of events, but the execution - that a building marketed as world-class can carry the weight of the worlds biggest stages without a stumble. When this run is done, I want people to look at SoFi Stadium and say, the worlds greatest building hosted the worlds greatest sporting events and did it flawlessly, he said. And that it represented Los Angeles. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/from-nfl-turf-to-olympic-pool-sofi-stadium-prepares-for-the-world-cup-and-la28

Coming off a frustrating start to 2026 with a disappointing 1-1 draw in LaLiga against Real Sociedad and a 2-1 loss in the Spanish Super Cup to bitter rivals Real Madrid, Diego Simeone fielded a near full-strength side at the Riazor Stadium, with only goalkeeper Jan Oblak rested among regular starters. Midfielder Conor Gallagher, reportedly close to joining Tottenham Hotspur, and forward Giacomo Raspadori, linked with a move to Atalanta, were also absent from the squad that made the trip to Galicia. Atletico dictated the early proceedings, with Julian Alvarez denied by La Coruna keeper German Parreno following a sharp effort, while Matteo Ruggeri struck the woodwork in the 15th minute. La Coruna came close to an opener when Cristian Herreras close-range shot was superbly saved by Atleticos back-up goalkeeper Juan Musso. Griezmann grew into the game, narrowly missing the target with a fierce strike from distance that rattled the crossbar in the 40th minute before the decisive moment arrived in the 61st. Awarded a free kick on the edge of the penalty area, Griezmann stepped up and delivered a left-footed effort that curled into the top corner, leaving keeper German Parreno with no chance. Atletico maintained control for much of the second half, their defensive organisation under Simeone proving impenetrable for a La Coruna side that has now won just once in their last seven outings across all competitions. Despite dominating possession and creating further chances, Atletico struggled to add to their lead, with Griezmanns strike proving the only goal of the match. Atletico were the first team to advance to the quarter-finals, as Real Madrid will visit Albacete on Wednesday in Alvaro Arbeloas debut as the clubs new manager following Xabi Alonsos departure on Monday.

The most successful World Cup Alpine skier of all time led Moltzan by 0.19 after the first run and stretched her advantage to 0.41 over the two legs of the floodlit night race on an icy and rutted piste. It was Shiffrins sixth win from seven slaloms this season, and sixth of her career in Flachau, and came after she was beaten by Switzerlands Camille Rast in the previous race in Kranjska Gora this month. The American now has 70 wins in slalom, and 96 podium finishes in the discipline. Austrias Katharina Truppe completed the podium in third place with Rast fourth as next months Milano Cortina Olympics draw ever closer. There is only one womens slalom, in the Czech resort of Spindleruv Mlyn on January 25, remaining before the Games and Shiffrin can clinch the World Cup crystal globe in the discipline there. Something I learned from Kranjska Gora is how important it is to get more comfortable with high speed in the slalom, so were practising that, said Shiffrin. I felt like I could show some of my top speed tonight on this second run... there were even moments then when I was like Oh my gosh, just kind of closing my eyes and hoping for it to be over a bit because its crazy to be going down the hill in that way. But I felt like the second run built up like a really good track actually. I was quite worried about that from the first. It wasnt insanely bumpy. There were some grooves for sure but it was quite enjoyable to ski. Moltzan has yet to win a World Cup race, with her four career second places all coming on Austrian snow, but the 2025 world championships giant slalom bronze medallist came closer to her dominant teammate and shared an embrace at the finish. It was her first slalom podium of the season although she was second in giant at the opening race in Soelden and third, also in giant, in Kranjska Gora. It feels a bit long-awaited but Im very grateful to be closing the gap to Mikaela which has kind of been the goal the whole season, said Moltzan. Switzerlands Wendy Holdener finished fifth, ahead of Swedish pair Anna Swenn Larsson and Sara Hector, with Italian-born Albanian Lara Colturi eighth and skiing the fastest second leg in a time of 53.77.

Arbeloa, who in his playing days at Real was an ally of his then-coach Mourinho, has drawn comparisons to the Portuguese veteran for his approach to management. The 42-year-old former defender was appointed to replace Xabi Alonso on Jan 12, a day after Real Madrid lost the Spanish Super Cup final against rivals Barcelona. I have not spoken to Jose yet. For me, it was a privilege and an honour to be coached by Jose Mourinho, Arbeloa told a news conference. I have a great relationship with him... and obviously he was someone who influenced me a lot, I carry him within me. (However) I am going to be Alvaro Arbeloa, because while its true I am not afraid of failing, and have never been, Im sure that if I tried to be Jose Mourinho, I would fail spectacularly. Mourinho, currently coaching Benfica, led Real between 2010 and 2013, winning one La Liga title. During that era, he battled against Pep Guardiolas dominant Barcelona when the fierce rivalry between the Catalan side and Real was at its most bitter. Barca currently lead Real by four points at the top of La Liga and Arbeloas job is to reverse the situation, although his first match in charge is at Albacete in the Copa del Rey last 16 on Jan 14. Arbeloa, who was coaching Reals reserve side and previously working with the clubs youth teams before he was promoted, said success is the most important thing for the record 15-time European champions. This club is winning, winning, and winning again. That demand on ourselves, showing the DNA of what brought us here, that has filled our trophy cabinets (is what I want), continued Arbeloa. When I was a player, I received those values from the players in the dressing room, and for me that is the most important thing... to be able to excite the fans we have all over the world and try to leave those cabinets even more full. That is my work, that is my obsession and what I will be living every day. Real did not announce how long Arbeloas contract as first-team coach would be. What I can tell you is that Ive been here for 20 years, at home, and I will be at Real Madrid as long as they want me here, added Arbeloa. This is my home, thats how I feel and thats how it will always be. Striker Kylian Mbappe was absent as Arbeloa took charge of his first training session on Jan 13 before the visit to face second-tier Albacete. Mbappe made his comeback from a knee sprain as a late substitute in the Spanish Super Cup final defeat by Barcelona on Jan 11, but is likely to keep working on his recovery until next the Champions League match against his former side Monaco next week. A Real Madrid source told AFP it was logical that Mbappe was absent from training, given his knee issue. Former coach Alonso had admitted it was a calculated risk to involve Reals top goalscorer in the match against Barca in Saudi Arabia. Arbeloa said he had a close relationship with Alonso, a former Real teammate and the Spanish national team. Everyone here knows the bond that connects me to him, the friendship that connects me to him, how much I value him, how much I love him, and I know thats mutual, has been mutual and will continue to be mutual, said Arbeloa. Alonso, replaced after less than eight months at the helm, said on social media he was leaving the club having done the best he could. Things didnt go as I would have liked, wrote the Basque coach on Instagram on Jan 13. Coaching Real Madrid was an honour and a responsibility. Im grateful to the club, the players and above all the fans for their confidence and support. I leave respectfully, with gratitude, and the pride of having done the best I could.

Eritrea set for international football comeback after six-year absence,"Jan 13, 2026, 11:45 PM","Jan 13, 2026, 11:45 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a1c6c0831c7e2c0968e46225bbeb5ecad051159eb874fa6387ec34c1ae2705ee,,"['World Cup', 'Eritrea', 'Africa']","TANGIERS, Morocco, Jan 13 - Eritrea is set to play its first football international in more than six years after entering the preliminaries for the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations finals, to be played in March. The isolated state on the Red Sea was drawn on Tuesday to take on Eswatini over two legs in the preliminary round in March, in what would be their first outing since a friendly loss to Sudan in January 2020. Eritrea has not participated in any internationals since eschewing the opportunity to compete in World Cup and Cup of Nations qualification after players consistently defected while on away trips. Eritrea has been ruled by President Isaias Afwerki since gaining independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and human rights groups consistently describe his rule as highly repressive. Players and other team members defected after matches or tournaments in Angola in 2007, Kenya in 2009, Tanzania in 2011, Uganda in 2012, Botswana in 2015, following a World Cup qualifier, and Uganda again in 2019. It is estimated some 80 footballers have defected while playing for the national team abroad, none of them going on to pursue their football careers in exile. Eritrea has not allowed teams to travel outside the country since members of its under-20 side fled to Uganda in 2019, but now seems to have had a change of heart. Eritrea did, however, enter the last Cup of Nations preliminaries only to later withdraw. If they play in the 2027 qualifiers, it will be the first ever Cup of Nations where every one of the 54 countries on the continent has competed. The bottom 12 teams in the rankings were drawn on Tuesday into six knockout round ties, to be played home and away in March, to get the 2027 qualifiers underway. The winners will advance to the group stage, along with Africas 42 top-ranked teams, to be divided into 12 groups of four teams each. The top two in each group then qualify for the finals, except in those groups where already-qualified co-hosts Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda are drawn to play. Eritrea has no FIFA ranking because it has not played a fixture within world footballs governing bodys parameters of 48 months. 2027 Africa Cup of Nations preliminary round draw: Djibouti v South Sudan Chad v Burundi Somalia v Mauritius Seychelles v Lesotho Eritrea v Eswatini Sao Tome e Principe v Ethiopia The team mentioned first plays at home in the first leg. The ties will be played between March 25-31. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/eritrea-set-for-international-football-comeback-after-six-year-absence
