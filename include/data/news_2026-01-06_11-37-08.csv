Tang Yu Ling, 23, pleaded guilty to one charge of Kpod possession on Jan 6. This is the first case of an offender being charged by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for an e-vaporiser-related offence for failing to attend rehabilitation, said the authorityonJan 6. The court heard that Tang was caught with an etomidate-laced vape in her home on Sept 2, 2025. She said she bought the device on Telegram, and knew that it contained etomidate. HSA said Tang was fined and placed on a rehabilitation programme in lieu of prosecution. On Sept 11, 2025, Tang was issued a Notice to Attend Rehabilitation at the Institute of Mental Health. The programme, which can be up to six months long, focuses on education, counselling and support to overcome addiction, including individual, group and family sessions. However, she did not attend her first appointment on Sept 24, 2025, and did not inform the authorities that she was unable to attend. As she failed to attend rehabilitation despite repeated reminders, HSA proceeded to bring charges against her for possession of etomidate, said the authority. When asked by Deputy Principal District Judge Kessler Soh why she did not turn up, Tang said she was sick. After meting out her sentence, the judge said: I hope you are aware of how serious your offence is, and that you will stop vaping after this. In its Jan 6 statement, HSA said it has been offering mandatory rehabilitation to first-time Kpod offenders to give them a chance to quit their habit with professional support. However, offenders, as in the case of Tang, who fail to attend and/or complete their rehabilitation will be charged in court. Such etomidate e-vaporiser offenders face a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to two years or both.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-jailed-a-week-for-kpod-possession-after-she-failed-to-attend-rehabilitation

Sim Chee Wei, 40, did this despite not knowing anything about the business of the companies he helped register, and even opened a corporate bank account before giving its details to the foreigner. The account received more than $250,000 in scam proceeds from the US. Sim, who had opened SIMCW Tech, and the firms bank account, had facilitated the work of a transnational scam syndicate. On Jan 6, SIMCW Tech was fined $32,000 for possessing property reasonably suspected to be the benefits of criminal conduct. Sim was sentenced to eight months and one weeks jail after pleading guilty to one count of possessing property suspected of being criminal proceeds, and one count of failing to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of duties as a director. Court documents show that the Commercial Affairs Department was notified on Aug 29, 2022, that a US-based company had been deceived into making fraudulent wire transfers to SIMCWs bank account twice in August 2022. The transfers, valued at US$209,892.84 (S$268,450), involved scam proceeds. Sim had been introduced by a friend named Roy in court documents to a stranger who claimed to be a Chinese national. He said he did not know the persons name, background and contact details. Despite that, Sim agreed to help register two firms, SIMCW Tech and SCWEI Tradings, in partnership with the stranger. Sim admitted he had never clarified how the businesses would be operated, whether they would have any employees, or where the offices would be located. Still, Sim agreed to help open a local corporate bank account under SIMCW Tech on Aug 16, 2022. He handed over details of the bank account to Roy. After Aug 19, 2022, he noticed there was more than US$200,000 in the account. He tried to withdraw the money for his own use, but the funds had already been flagged by the bank as criminal proceeds. In a statement on Jan 6, 2026, the police said Sim failed to exercise any supervision over the affairs of both companies he helped to register, and he was unaware of the transactions taking place in the bank account. The police said they took a serious stance against anyone involved in laundering crime proceeds as these crimes compromise the integrity of Singapores financial system. They added: To ensure that Singapore remains a safe and trusted place for business and finance, the police will take tough enforcement action against such perpetrators, who will be dealt with in accordance with the law. In 2023, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority prosecuted nine nominee directors, including a man who ran a business helping Chinese clients set up companies here and became anominee director of 980 companies. More than $5 million was laundered by the companies under him, and he was sentenced to four weeks jail, fined $57,000 and banned from being a director for five years.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-fine-for-man-who-registered-shell-companies-opened-bank-accounts-for-scam-syndicate
"AI, quantum computing and interdisciplinary research to reshape science: Heng Swee Keat","Jan 06, 2026, 05:35 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 06:44 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a481bfbb8280a1cf4afc740555a423cac04013b741aefea7377a75e7ddc1e5a1,National Research Foundation chairman Heng Swee Keat outlined the three key trends at the opening ceremony of the 14th Global Young Scientists Summit.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO,[],"SINGAPORE – As the world is in the midst of a revolution in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, the research and innovation field will also be impacted in fundamental ways, said Mr Heng Swee Keat, chairman of the National Research Foundation (NRF). Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 14th Global Young Scientists Summit on Jan 6, Mr Heng outlined the three key trends that are set to shape the future of science. The first is AI, which provides scientists with techniques and tools of immense sophistication that can be applied to increasingly complex and difficult scientific problems, he said. However, these developments would also raise concerns about ethics, accountability and misuse. Scientists and innovators must work with policymakers all over the world to develop and apply AI systems ethically and responsibly, said Mr Heng. The second trend, he noted, is the advancement of quantum computing. It is similar to traditional computing but operates in ultra-cold temperatures near absolute zero or minus 273.15 deg C. At such temperatures, quantum objects such as electrons or particles of light are manipulated to execute complex mathematical calculations beyond the reach of traditional computers. Quantum computing is advancing swiftly and is on the brink of solving what are once-unsolvable computational problems – from simulating complex biological systems to optimising supply chains, Mr Heng said. Yet, much work remains to be done to build scalable, reliable fault-tolerant quantum systems. The third trend, he highlighted, is interdisciplinary research becoming more important as challenges facing humanity get increasingly complex and require expertise from multiple fields. For example, climate change requires a combination of environmental science, engineering, data science and policy analysis. At the NRF, we are committed to fostering such interdisciplinary collaboration, knowing that the solutions to our greatest challenges will come from these intersections of scientific and other fields of knowledge. This comes as Singapore is set to implement theResearch, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2030 plan, the countrys next five-year strategy to strengthen its research capabilities. Announced in December 2025, RIE2030 will have a budget of $37 billion, amounting to around 1 per cent of the nations gross domestic product. From this funding, $3 billion will be set aside for two new high-level research programmes – the RIE Grand Challenges to drive more impact in national strategic priorities, and the RIE Flagships to push for creation of economic value. The first Grand Challenge will focus on the ageing population, while the first Flagship project will focus on semiconductors to establish Singapore as a strategically important research and development (R&D) node in this industry. Mr Heng said that through both RIE Flagships and Grand Challenges, NRF is taking a systematic approach to define desired economic and strategic outcomes, identify major bottlenecks where R&D is needed, and develop coordinated portfolios of research and innovation programmes to realise the targeted goals. At the same time, NRF will continue to invest heavily to keep Singapores basic research talent and expertise at the cutting edge. In parallel, the foundation will develop capabilities and infrastructure in AI, data and advanced computing. NRF plans to implement a long-term funding strategy to maintain and upgrade its essential research infrastructure, ensuring that scientists have access to the advanced tools and facilities for globally competitive research. Mr Heng also pointed out that excellence in research is ultimately about developing and bringing together the best talents from Singapore and around the world to work on the most critical challenges. To that end, NRF will further strengthen its portfolio of research grants, fellowships and investigatorships to nurture both leading and promising local researchers, attract top-tier and emergent research talent from around the world. The foundation will also continue to build new links and deepen existing ones among researchers in Singapore and the global scientific community. The five-day conference, which ends on Jan 9, will see the largest number of participants since its inauguration in 2013. Over 400 young researchers from 57 countries, including participants from Columbia, Kazakhstan, Mexico and South Africa, are taking part for the first time. Twenty-one eminent scientists, including Nobel laureates, Turing Prize winners and Millennium Technology Prize recipients, will also be gracing the event.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ai-quantum-computing-and-interdisciplinary-research-to-reshape-science-says-heng-swee-keat

Shanmugaratnam, was ordered to spend 6½ years behind bars.ST PHOTOS: KELVIN CHNG","['Singapore courts', 'Crime', 'Fraud']","SINGAPORE – Singaporean R. Shanmugaratnam,who was earlier convicted of 13 counts of falsification of accounts linked to nearly €1.1 billion(S$1.65 billion) purportedly held in escrow for collapsed German payments company Wirecard and its related firms, was sentenced to 10 years jail on Jan 6. Briton James Henry OSullivan, 51, who had abetted Shanmugaratnam, 59, was ordered to spend 6½ years behind bars. OSullivan was earlier convicted of five counts of falsification of accounts. A district court had found them guilty of their charges in September 2025 after a trial. In earlier proceedings, the court heard that from 2016 to 2018, Shanmugaratnam, who was then a director of Citadelle Corporate Services, issued 13 balance confirmation letters. The documents falsely confirmed to Wirecard AG, its related companies WCUKI and Cardsystems, as well as their auditors, that Citadelle held nearly €1.1 billion in escrow for the Wirecard entities across three financial years. Escrow is an essential service in capital markets that supports transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. OSullivan had abetted Shanmugaratnam to issue five of the letters in March 2017, the court heard. The pairs cases are said to be linked to Jan Marsalek, 45,an Austrian fugitive, a former businessman and suspected spy operative for Russia. Marsalek was the chief operating officer of Wirecard AG from 2010 to 2020. An Interpol Red Notice has been issued against him. Once such a notice is issued, the police in other countries can be on the lookout for foreign offenders. The Red Notice can then be used to support extradition proceedings after an arrest is made. Oliver Bellenhaus, a German who used to be managing director of Cardsystems Middle East FZ – a Dubai subsidiary of Wirecard Technologies – was also named in court documents tendered by Singapores prosecution. Deputy public prosecutors Gordon Oh, Alexandria Shamini Joseph and Louis Ngia had earlier stated in court documents that OSullivan got to know Shanmugaratnam after the Briton engaged Citadelles services to set up companies in Singapore. Citadelle then offered corporate secretarial services to 30 of OSullivans companies, including Brightyear, Senjo Group and Senjo Payment. OSullivan was also the owner of multiple accounts on e-mail platforms and messaging app Telegram. Shanmugaratnam believed that he was communicating with OSullivan through these e-mail accounts, said the prosecution. Court documents stated that OSullivan was Marsaleks long-time business partner and friend. OSullivan introduced Marsalek to Shanmugaratnam on an occasion before July 2015, said the prosecutors. According to (Shanmugaratnam), he was asked by (Marsalek) to act as an escrow agent between Wirecard entities and (OSullivans) companies, they added. Among other things, Shanmugaratnam received a request on Feb 23, 2016, from accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) for Citadelle to confirm the balance of all accounts held by Wirecard AG and/or its subsidiaries with Citadelle as of Dec 31, 2015. In March 2016, he received a document from Marsalek, which contained draft wordings to be put into balance confirmation letters. The DPPs said: Shortly after, Shanmugaratnam prepared (three) letters on Citadelles letterhead using the wording provided in (the) document. Shanmugaratnam then sent the three letters to EY via e-mail on March 29, 2016. On the same day, EY Germany replied to confirm receipt of the e-mail. The letters had mentioned three escrow accounts, and each of them purportedly had a balance of between €30 million and more than €66 million. Court documents stated that, in fact, Citadelle was not holding these sums of money for Wirecard and/or its subsidiaries as of Dec 31, 2015. On May 23, 2016, Shanmugaratnam received an e-mail from Bellenhaus, asking him to provide confirmation that Citadelle held an additional €41.5 million in an escrow account as of March 31, 2016. The e-mail contained the wording to be used for a letter of confirmation to be addressed to WCUKI. In May that year, Shanmugaratnam prepared letters using words provided by Bellenhaus. After that, he sent them to Bellenhaus via e-mail. The letters had mentioned two escrow accounts, and each of them purportedly had a balance of between €30.3 million and €41.5 million as of March 31, 2016. Shanmugaratnam went on to commit similar offences involving the remaining letters, and five of them were linked to OSullivan. Wirecardfiled for bankruptcy in 2020after disclosing that €1.9 billion in cash, supposed to be in bank accounts in the Philippines, did not exist. The companys former chief executive Markus Braun and several other top executives were then arrested. On Jan 6, the court heard that OSullivan and Shanmugaratnam will be appealing against their convictions and sentences. The pair still have three pending charges in total that will be dealt with at a later date.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-singaporean-briton-over-offences-linked-to-wirecard

The DPP said that on Sept 11 and 12, 2025, C1s wife received multiple messages from either the maid or the maids husband from different numbers. Three of the messages showed the victims picture. One of them stated that the sender hoped the maid could return to Indonesia, while another message said: Maybe you are not interested, but I will spam your number every day.

After about five to 10 minutes on the tracks, he left the vicinity and uploaded the clip to Instagram. He was caught after an SMRT employee saw the video and alerted the police. On Jan 6, the 17-year-old offender, who cannot be named due to a gag order, was sentenced to 18 months probation. He must remain indoors from 10pm to 6am every day and perform 80 hours of community service.His parents were bonded for $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour. The teen must also attend all psychiatric and psychological assessments and treatments. He had earlier pleaded guilty to endangering the safety of others who were travelling along the railway. He also admitted to an unrelated criminal trespass charge. Deputy Public Prosecutor Xu Sijia told the court that in January 2025, the offender noticed two scaffolding structures leading up to the train tracks in Upper Changi Road. He then hatched a plan to explore the train tracks by accessing them via the scaffolding. In the evening of March 27, 2025, he went to the scaffolding area and waited for the people working there to leave. He then removed his shirt and wore it around his face to conceal his identity, before entering the area through a gap in a fence. He ducked down to avoid detection and moved towards the scaffolding structure. After that, the teenager lay down and squeezed through a gap between a gate and the ground. The DPP said: He then climbed up a staircase behind the gate which led to the train tracks. He paused halfway on the staircase and ducked down when he saw two people walking along a footpath. When he heard an approaching train, he lay down beside the train track to avoid detection and recorded a video of the passing train with his phone. After the train passed, he crossed to the opposite side while still recording the video. The teenager then snapped a photo and took another video of the train tracks before leaving through the same scaffolding. He later told investigators that he was on the train tracks for about five to 10 minutes, and saw between four and six trains passing by. Soon after, he uploaded the video of the passing train online via the Instagram Story function, making it viewable only to account holders in his close friends list. On June 9, 2025, he uploaded the video on his second Instagram account using the same function. But the next day, he found out that the video had been reposted on another partys Instagram account. Noticing that the video was becoming viral, the teenager deleted his second Instagram account to try and avoid detection. DPP Xu said: The accuseds actions endangered the safety of the commuters travelling on the trains… and himself, and also posed a real risk of disruption to train operations. In a separate incident, the teenager was at home at around 11pm on May 16, 2025 when he felt the urge to do some climbing. Clad in only his underwear and shoes, he left his home and took a lift to the 14th floor of a block of Housing Board flats. After that, he walked up a flight of stairs to the 16th floor, and went to the end of a corridor. A 27-year-old man was in his own flat when he heard noises nearby. He went to the corridor and saw the teenager leaning on a parapet ledge. The DPP said: The complainant felt scared and returned to his unit to call the police for assistance. While making the call, the complainant noticed that the accused was on the parapet ledge attempting to climb onto the roof of the HDB block. The offender made his way to the rooftop where he sat down, listened to music and made video calls before police arrived at the scene. When he heard some officers shouting for him, he walked to the opposite end of the rooftop, and made use of some ledges and laundry racks toclimb down. He then noticed bystanders and police officers on the ground floor looking for him. In a bid to evade arrest, he entered an 86-year-old womans unit through an openwindow. It is not stated where the window was located. He thentried to open the windows near the front door. When the teenager heard police officers approaching, he entered the victims bedroom and hid under her bed. The DPP said that the elderly woman was sleeping and did not notice the offenders presence. He decided to surrender himself to the authorities about 30 minutes later, and found the womans key on her bed. He opened the front door and surrendered to the officers, who woke the woman up and told her about the incident.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/probation-for-teen-who-entered-mrt-tracks-during-operational-hours-and-filmed-train

Court documents stated that these assets were meant for MDRs promotional activities. However, Richard Siua Cheng Foo, 54, sold them through a third-party dealer, offering the latter a cut of every sale. Siua also used a portion of his ill-gotten gains to fund his gambling habit. On Jan 6, he was sentenced to five years and six months jail after he pleaded guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust involving 625 mobile devices worth nearly $980,000 in total. Four other charges relating to the remaining amount were considered during his sentencing. He has not made any restitution to MDR. At the time of the offences, Siua was also the chief executive and director of several of MDRs subsidiaries – 3 Mobile Telecom, Handphoneshop and A-Mobile. These subsidiaries were collectively referred to as the group in court documents, and a search with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority revealed that he no longer holds these positions with them. Deputy Public Prosecutor Louis Ngia said that the group was in the business of distributing and selling mobile handsets and accessories. The prosecutor added that as the CEO of MDRs subsidiaries, Siua had the authority to instruct his staff to withdraw and deliver to him the firms mobile devices from warehouses for legitimate business purposes. However, he started misappropriating these company assets from November 2020 and sold them for his own financial gain. The DPP said: The accused started on this course of offending conduct as he had become addicted to gambling, and he wanted the monies to fund his gambling bets. He also realised that his staff trusted him to use the assets to the benefit of the company, and did not monitor his use of them or question his instructions. According to court documents, Siua sold these company assets with the help of his friend, one Tan Yeow Kian, then the director of a firm called Next Telecom, which dealt with mobile phones and accessories. The case involving Tan, 54, whom the DPP referred to as Freddy, is still pending. The DPP said that Siua, who was facing financial difficulties, had taken personal loans from Tan. He added: The accused acquired Freddys assistance to sell the company assets on his behalf. Freddy did not buy the (goods) directly from the accused but would act as a dealer by helping the accused look for buyers. After securing a buyer for those goods, Freddy would take a cut of the sale proceeds as his own profit. On occasions, the remainder of the sale proceeds was used to offset the amount that the accused owed Freddy. In 2020 and 2021, Siua misappropriated a total of 4,057 units of company assets worth over $2.5 million, the court heard. His offences first came to MDRs attention in December 2021. After using up almost all the subsidiaries marketing funds that he was handling, Siua approached the CEO of MDR for a company loan. Suspecting that Siua was facing financial woes, the CEO asked MDRs finance department to conduct a check on his use of the groups finances. The department then discovered a sharp spike in the groups marketing expenditure for 2021 compared with previous years. It also found that Siua had requested for numerous mobile devices to be released. The DPP told the court that these were unusual circumstances and MDRs CEO confronted Siua about the matter during a meeting. Siua came clean about what he had done, and MDRs chief financial officer alerted the police on Dec 15, 2021. Siua surrendered himself to the police soon after. He was not the first individual linked to MDR to be dealt with in court in recent months. Police said in a statement on Jan 6 that a man identifiedas Peter Ng Eng Ming, a former sales director of one of MDRs subsidiaries, was earlier sentenced to a year and 11 months jail in a separate case. Ng had pleaded guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust in August 2025. A police spokesperson said: As sales director, Ng had the authority to instruct his staff to withdraw company assets for business purposes. Similar to Siua, Ng misappropriated these company assets by selling them for personal gains. Between January 2019 and December 2021, Ng misappropriated 155 units of mobile devices and accessories worth around $200,000.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-man-who-misappropriated-over-2-5m-in-company-assets-while-he-was-coo-of-sgx-listed-firm

The research used forest inventory data from 2,700 plots across the country, ranging from cool moist forests to dry savanna. It excluded areas affected by logging, clearance or fires to examine how background tree mortality has changed in recent decades. What we found is that the mortality rate has consistently increased over time, in all of the different forest types, said Professor Belinda Medlyn from Western Sydney Universitys Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment. And this increase is very likely caused by the increase in temperature, she told AFP. The world has warmed by an average of nearly 1.2 deg C since the pre-industrial era. Most of this warming has occurred in the last 50 years. The rate at which trees die off in a forest can vary in response to different types of disturbances, or as forests grow thicker and there is greater competition for resources. But the research, published in the Nature Plants journal, excluded areas affected by fires or clearing, and also examined the stand basal area – the sum of the cross-sectional areas of all trees in an area. The (mortality) trend over time remains even after we correct for basal area, explained Prof Medlyn, who led the research. The scale of the increase varied across the four different biomes surveyed, with the sharpest rise in tropical savannas. There, the number of trees dying on average increased by 3.2 per cent a year, from close to 15 per 1,000 in 1996, to nearly double that number by 2017. The research found that the deaths were not being matched by tree growth, so forest stock overall is declining. That makes it very likely that the overall carbon storage capacity in the forests is declining over time, said Prof Medlyn. And given the trend was observed across four ecosystems – tropical savanna, cool temperate forest, warm temperate forest and tropical rainforest – it is likely to be a widespread phenomenon, not just an Australian thing, she added. The rising mortality rate tracks warming and drying linked to climate change, and the study found the fastest rise in hotter, dryer regions. The research comes months after a study found Australias tropical rainforests were among the first in the world to start emitting more carbon dioxide than they absorb. Taken together, the findings paint a worrying picture of our continued ability to rely on forests to absorb our emissions. Forests globally currently sequester about one-third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, said Prof Medlyn. Our study suggests their capacity to act as buffer will decline over time.AFP",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/climate-driven-tree-deaths-speeding-up-in-australia-study

Andy Wong/Pool via REUTERS",[],"BEIJING, Jan 6 - Irelands Prime Minister Micheal Martin was to hold in-depth trade talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday, aiming to strengthen strategic ties with the worlds second-largest economy amid strained China-EU relations. The meeting is part of Martins five-day trip, which would have a significant economic dimension, according to a clip posted on his X account. Martin told media he would discuss issues such as beef exports and Chinas new dairy tariffs, following Mondays summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. I discussed obviously the situation in terms of Irish beef exports into China, the tariff situation in respect of dairy products, Martin said, adding that Xi undertook to engage with Chinese officials in respect of those specific issues. Martin described his meeting with Xi as warm and constructive, covering bilateral and EU-China ties. On a broader level, I think the President was keen that Europe and China would have a broader framework to govern trade into the future, he said. Xi told Martin during their meeting that China and the EU should bear the long-term picture in mind, state news agency Xinhua reported. Ireland will always be constructive on trading matters. Weve always been in the school within the European Union that has favoured open trade, Martin said on Irish radio. China-EU ties have been tense since the EU imposed levies on Chinese EV imports in 2024, prompting Chinese retaliation including tariffs on EU dairy products. BEEF AND DAIRY GOODS Ireland exports the bulk of its output from its beef and dairy industries, which are major employers in the country. It is among Europes largest exporters of dairy, shipping about 6 billion euros ($7.04 billion) annually. Irish beef exports to China have been suspended since 2024 after a mad cow disease case. On a visit to China in November, Junior Minister for Agriculture Timmy Dooley said Dublin was making progress in persuading Beijing that Irish beef was safe but that there was a way to go to clear the resumption of exports. Irish beef, which the country markets as a premium commodity in the UK and Europe, also faces competition from cheaper South American imports. Last week, China also set import quotas and extra tariffs on beef imports from this year, hitting global suppliers. Martin, the first Taoiseach to visit China since 2012, has recently downplayed Irish intelligence warnings portraying China as a hostile state actor, preferring instead to adopt a long-term and strategic understanding of China.

Growing unease in Asia-Pacific as US strike on Venezuela challenges rules-based order,"Jan 06, 2026, 05:45 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 07:00 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a30b95b1e2af2fa3f70a4d88e6c9dac0ef66108847042365622781c32b6b360,Captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro being escorted to a courthouse in New York on Jan 5 for an initial appearance to face US. federal charges.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['Venezuela', 'Nicolas Maduro', 'United States', 'Philippines', 'Japan']","MANILA– While governments across the Asia-Pacific region have responded cautiously to theUS attack on Venezuela, lawmakers and former officials have hit out at Washingtons move, saying its actions risk accelerating the erosion of the rules-based international order. In particular, the episode has drawn pointed rebukes in countries that rely on international law to push back against stronger powers – a concern that resonates deeply in Asias contested security landscape. For Asian states facing flashpoints such as in the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula, the issue is less Venezuela itself than the precedent the recent US military action sets. Analysts warn that a further slide towards might-makes-right behaviour could leave smaller states more exposed in a world increasingly shaped by power rather than rules. In the Philippines, opposition lawmaker Leila de Lima stood apart from the governments more calibrated tone, as the Department of Foreign Affairs called on all parties to respect the UN Charter and exercise restraint to prevent escalation. Ms de Lima argued that the US military operation in Venezuela undermined the rules-based international order and weakened the Philippines moral position as it confronts Chinas assertiveness in the West Philippine Sea. The West Philippine Sea is the name used by Manila for parts of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone. As a US ally, this leaves the Philippines with a compromised moral ascendancy in opposing Chinese actions, she warned. Likewise, Japanese former defence minister Itsunori Onodera described the US move as the very definition of changing the status quo by force and warned it could undermine efforts to rally international opinion against China and Russia. Japanese media editorials were also broadly critical, with the Yomiuri daily cautioning that if major powers prioritise military force over international law, the international order itself would be at risk. In contrast, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi avoided commenting on whether the US violated international law, using carefully worded remarks that did not mention Washington or US President Donald Trump by name. Political scientist Aries Arugay, a visiting senior fellow at Singapores ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, said the Venezuela episode was significant for Asia because it appeared to confirm a shift in US behaviour under Mr Trump. The US has traditionally presented itself as a status quo power that upholds the rules-based international order, he said. What were seeing under Trump 2.0 is much less interest in maintaining that order. Thats bad news for us in Asia, he added, noting that countries such as the Philippines, Japan and South Korea have relied on the US as a stabiliser against Chinas hegemonic behaviour. Our precarity just got intensified. Dr Tosh Minohara, chair of Kobe-based think-tank Research Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said Washingtons action indicates that the rule of law, which used to be a big American thing, is malleable under Mr Trump. It proves the point that since the US is powerful, it gets to set the rules, he said. But what it does not realise is that this puts off a lot of countries and fuels anti-American resentment that manifests itself in a way that is not readily apparent. Meanwhile, Indonesia has emerged as one of the more forceful official voices in South-east Asia. It issued a carefully worded statement expressing deep concern over the use or threat of force, adding a warning that such actions risk setting a dangerous precedent in international relations. Indonesias Foreign Ministry stressed that respect for sovereignty, diplomacy and international humanitarian law was essential, particularly the protection of civilians, signalling unease over how quickly military force was deployed in the snatch-and-grab operation that whisked away Venezuelas sitting President Nicolas Maduro from a fortified compound in the heart of capital Caracas. India, which has sought to preserve strategic autonomy amid competing pressures, expressed deep concern without directly criticising Washington. Analysts noted that Indias stance is linked to New Delhis reluctance to antagonise the US amid ongoing trade tensions – especially with trade talks reaching the final stages – and its broader caution in conflicts involving its partners. It would be odd if India, which didnt condemn the invasion of Ukraine, had condemned the US invasion of Venezuela, said Dr Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at New Delhis Observer Research Foundation. In Singapore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said the Republicis gravely concerned by the US intervention in Venezuela. Singapore is deeply committed to international law and the principles of the UN Charter that safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, especially small states. Singapore has consistently opposed actions contrary to international law by any parties, including foreign military intervention in any country, MFA said in a statement on Jan 4. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who is on a state visit to China until Jan 7, did not directly comment on the US operation but instructed his Foreign Ministry to prepare to evacuate South Koreans in Venezuela if needed. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, meanwhile, urged all parties to support dialogue and diplomacy to prevent escalation, saying Canberra continued to support international law and a peaceful, democratic transition in Venezuela. He also noted longstanding concerns about Venezuelas democratic and human rights record. Taiwan stood out for its more bullish reading of recent events. In comments reported by Bloomberg, Taiwanese officials framed the Venezuela operation as a demonstration of US military capability and deterrence, arguing that Beijing was constrained less by precedent than by capacity. Online reaction in Taiwan, however, was divided, with some warning that the US operation could embolden China. For US partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the Venezuela episode has become a reminder of an uncomfortable reality, which is that while US military power remains central to regional deterrence, the credibility of the rules it once championed is no longer assured. So what can we do? The other option really is that the burden of upholding the rules-based international order now falls into the hands of small to middle-sized countries, said Dr Arugay.

All dual-use items are banned from being exported to Japan for military use effective immediately, Chinas Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Jan 6. Exports for any other end-user purposes that could enhance Japans military capabilities are also prohibited, it added, without elaborating. Japans leader recently made erroneous remarks on Taiwan, hinting at the possibility of military intervention in the Taiwan Strait, a ministry spokesperson said in a statement. Those comments violated the One-China principle and were malicious nature with profoundly detrimental consequences, the spokesperson added. An official from the trade and economic security bureau in Japans Trade Ministry declined to comment, saying the bureau was checking on the situation. It wasnt immediately clear whether the curbs were largely symbolic or would have a significant impact on Japan. China restricted rare earths exports in global measures rolled out in 2024 during US President Donald Trumps trade war. Rare earths and the magnets made from them are used heavily by militaries in weapons like fighter jets, drones and missiles, and are relied on for manufacturing goods such as smartphones and electric vehicles. Japan relied on China for around 70 per cent of its rare earth imports as of 2024, according to the Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security. Chinas catalogue of dual-use goods also includes drones, nuclear materials and facilities, aerospace engine components and specialist alloys. The curbs mark the latest move in a pressure campaign against Japan, after Ms Takaichi suggested thatTokyo could deploy its militaryif Beijing attempted to seize Taiwan, which China claims as its own. Despite restrictions on Japanese seafood imports and a travel boycott by some Chinese citizens, Japans leader has refused to retract her comments, as China demands, maintaining that her countrys policy remains unchanged. Chinas measures come during South Korean PresidentLee Jae Myungs visit this week to Beijing, where the nations leader Xi Jinping has urged him to stand on the right side of history.

Mr Nga said community service orders under the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007 (Act 672)had come into effecton Jan 1 as part of stricter enforcement of minor littering offences. The punishment follows amendments to Act 672, which were passed by the Dewan Rakyat –the Malaysian Parliaments House of Representatives– in August 2025 and tabled in the Dewan Negara –the Upper House of the Malaysian Parliament– the same month. The enforcement would cover Johor, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perlis and Kedah, as well as the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. Mr Nga added that SWCorp has been instructed to take firm action against litterbugs, warning that heavier penalties await offenders. Once caught, they will be given a new uniform – a green jacket – and made to work alongside local council cleaners to sweep roads, clean drains, cut grass and clean toilets. They can be fined between RM2,000 and RM10,000.

The young influencer, who had around 58,000 followers, was found in a condition that bore little resemblance to her glamorous online image. The case that began with the disappearance of Umi, who is in her 20s, has become a major story in China. Umi had told her family she was going to Cambodia after an invitation by her Chinese boyfriend who lived there, with promises of a high-paying job and building a prosperous future together. After 26 days without contact with her family, she was found on a roadside in Cambodia and appeared to be homeless. She was holding X-ray films that appeared to show injuries to her legs, with visible signs of assault, and appeared disoriented and incoherent. A Chinese national in the area reportedly stepped in to help. Earlier, her family had sought assistance from the Chinese Embassy in Phnom Penh. The embassy acted quickly, contacting multiple parties, including the Cambodian police and local contacts, to trace her whereabouts. The consular office in the Cambodian town of Sihanoukville later found her on Jan 3 at a hospital, where she was described as being in very poor physical health. Officials arranged for her to be transferred to another hospital for urgent treatment, and said she would be repatriated once her condition stabilised. Before this ordeal, the woman, identified only as having the surname Wu, was known for posting about her lavish lifestyle online and was said to have worked at an upscale club in Chinas Fujian province.

Mr Hei Seki, a member of Japans Parliament, wassanctioned in September by Chinaand banned from entering the country for spreading fallacies on issues such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and disputed islands. China claims Taiwan is part of its territory and has an ongoing spat with Tokyo over islands in the East China Sea claimed by both countries, and considers foreign criticism on sensitive political topics to be acts of interference. The fact that I am able today to smoothly enter Taiwan... fully demonstrates that the Peoples Republic of China and the Republic of China are completely two different countries, Mr Seki told reporters, using Taiwans official name. I came to Taiwan today, first of all, to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country, he said. Chinas foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a press briefing that the rantings of petty villains arent worth responding to. Mr Seki will attend a banquet on Jan 6, along with Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai, the Indo-Pacific Strategy think tank in Taipei, which is hosting Mr Sekis visit, said. Chinas foreign ministry said previously that Mr Seki, a naturalised Japanese citizen, had spread false information, colluded with Japanese anti-China forces, and wantonly attacked and smeared China. The ministry also cited visits by Mr Seki, who is also known by his Chinese name Shi Ping, to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honours Japans war dead including several World War II war criminals. China has said it would freeze Mr Sekis assets in the country, forbid Chinese entities from conducting transactions with him, and deny entry visas to him or his family. Japanese officials said at the time that Mr Seki was the first Japanese lawmaker to be sanctioned by the Chinese government, and that Tokyo had lodged a protest with China to demand it withdraw the measures. While Japan and Taiwan do not have formal diplomatic ties, Japanese lawmakers often visit the democratic island.

REUTERS/Raquel Cunha","['Venezuela', 'Mexico', 'Donald Trump']","MEXICO CITY, Jan 6 - In the wake of the U.S. attack on Venezuela, the Mexican government has found itself traversing the most delicate balancing act since President Donald Trump began his second term: strongly condemning the operation while doubling down on bilateral cooperation lest Mexico find itself in Trumps crosshairs next. On Saturday, hours after the elite U.S. special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in their home, Trump floated the prospect of U.S. military action inside Mexico, saying drug cartels are running the country and that something is gonna have to be done with Mexico. The weekends events clearly rattled Mexicos President Claudia Sheinbaum. She started her daily morning press conference on Monday reading from a document that detailed Mexicos position on Venezuela. We categorically reject intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, she said. The history of Latin America is clear and compelling: intervention has never brought democracy, never generated well-being, nor lasting stability. Sheinbaums comments rank among her sharpest criticisms of Washington since Trump took office and are among the strongest rebukes in the region of Maduros ouster. Security analysts said Sheinbaums fierce condemnation of the attack signaled that she would not tolerate similar actions against drug traffickers in Mexico. The U.S. Justice Department has charged Maduro with crimes related to drug trafficking, terrorism and weapons; he pleaded not guilty in a New York courthouse on Monday and declared himself a prisoner of war. But behind the scenes, Mexico City is likely to move even closer to Washington in the wake of the Venezuela attack, hoping that increasingly tight bilateral security cooperation will stave off U.S. aggressions, Mexican officials and security analysts said. Increasing joint security cooperation and strengthening Mexicos own fight against the cartels will be key to avoiding unilateral U.S. military intervention, said a Mexican security official who spoke on condition of anonymity. A WARNING TO THE ENTIRE REGION Security analysts say the attack on Venezuela significantly elevated the stakes for Mexico City by signaling just how far Trump is willing to go to assert U.S. dominance in Latin America. It served as a warning to the entire region, said Mexican security analyst Carlos Perez Ricart. (Sheinbaum) is walking a very fine line: declaring a firm stance against intervention but also doing the only thing Mexico can do with such an asymmetrical power dynamic: continue to cooperate with the U.S. Over the last year, Sheinbaum has successfully traversed this political tight rope, defending Mexicos sovereignty while placating Washington with two mass expulsions to the U.S. of alleged high-level cartel operatives and undertaking a year-long military offensive against the Sinaloa Cartel. Such actions have drawn praise from top U.S. officials. I think that the ongoing bilateral investigations and cooperation has been moving in the right direction, said Derek Maltz, who served as acting administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration at the beginning of Trumps second term. He said he doesnt anticipate U.S. military action in Mexico in the near future. David Mora, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said he expected to see the Mexican government engage in joint military operations with the U.S., something it hasnt done to date. Pressure on Sheinbaum will increase. LAW OF THE JUNGLE As the fallout over Venezuela continues, officials in Mexico weighed the possibility - however remote - of a military attack. While few believe Washington would target Mexican leadership as it did with Maduro, even a unilateral move against drug cartels would deliver a severe blow to the government, undermining its authority and violating the sovereignty it has vowed to defend. It would be an international catastrophe, said Mexican Congressman Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, a close ally of Sheinbaums, who said that he didnt think Washington would go so far because of the two countries close relationship on security and trade, and Mexicos strong disposition to collaborate and cooperate with the U.S. The world cant live in the law of the jungle. Analysts, including Perez Ricart, said they thought U.S. attention would turn to other Latin American countries before Mexico, after Trump criticized the leadership of Colombia and Cuba on Sunday. The Mexican security official agreed. Until we see (attacks in) Colombia and Cuba, then well know that were next, the official said.

REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt","['Joe Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'Minority']","WASHINGTON, Jan 6 - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives will mark the fifth anniversary of a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump with an unofficial hearing that will probe ongoing threats to elections and public safety. Democrats, as the minority party in Congress, do not have the power to set the legislative agenda, but they can hold informal events to highlight their proposals and criticize Republicans. We will examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement announcing the forum. He said it also will look into Trumps pardons of more than 1,500 people who were criminally charged with participating in the January 6 violence. The Trump administration has sought states voter registration lists, leading to fears the information could be misused. Trump has urged states to abandon mail-in ballots and has hinted at running for a third presidential term in 2028, which would violate the U.S. Constitution. The January 6, 2021 riot, a failed attempt by thousands of Trump supporters to overturn Trumps 2020 defeat by Democrat Joe Biden, sent lawmakers running for their lives and injured about 140 law enforcement officers. Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. One police officer, who was attacked by protesters, died the following day. Four other police officers subsequently died by suicide. Trump insisted the election was stolen from him through fraud, even though he lost a series of court cases challenging the election result. Some Republicans blamed far-left activists for the attack, and party lawmakers set up a new committee last year to uncover the full truth from that day. True accountability requires focusing on facts, not selective storytelling for partisan gain, the chairman of the subcommittee, Barry Loudermilk, said in reference to the Democrats hearing. Also on Tuesday, Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys far-right militant group who was found guilty of helping to plan the riot, has announced a patriotic and peaceful march to honor the memory of protesters who died that day. He received a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy but was subsequently pardoned by Trump.

U.S. forces ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a surprise operation at the weekend. He faces four criminal charges in the U.S., including narco-terrorism, and Maduros vice president has been sworn in as interim president. It is clear that the operation undermined a fundamental principle of international law, that states must not threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, said the Office. The international community needs to come together with one voice to insist on that, chief spokesperson for the Office, Ravina Shamdasani, told reporters. Far from being a victory for human rights, the military intervention damages the architecture of international security and makes every country less safe, she said. It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like, she added. The future of Venezuela must be determined by its people alone, she said, adding instability and further militarization would only make the human rights situation there worse.

The protests have spread to some cities in western and southern Iran, but do not match the scale of unrest that swept the nation in 2022 to 2023 over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Irans morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republics strict dress code. However, even though smaller, these protests have quickly expanded from an economic focus to broader frustrations, with some protesters chanting against the countrys clerical rulers. Iran also remains under international pressure, with US President Donald Trump threatening on Jan 2 to come to theaid of protesters in Iran if security forces fired on them. In response, Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed not to yield to the enemy. Hengaw, a Kurdish Iranian rights group, put the death toll at 25, including four people under 18. It said more than 1,000 people had been arrested. HRANA, a network of rights activists, said at least 29 had been killed, including two law enforcement agents, in addition to 1,203 arrests, as at Jan 5. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the numbers. Iranian authorities have not given a death toll for protesters, but have said at least two members of the security services have died, and more than a dozen have been injured in the unrest. While drawing a distinction between protesters and rioters, law enforcement has dealt with strength against rioters by arresting them on the scene or later following identification by intelligence units, Irans police chief Ahmadreza Radan was quoted by state media on Jan 6 as saying. I pledge that we will deal with the last of these rioters. It is still time for those who were deceived by foreign services to identify themselves and draw on the Islamic Republics greatness. HRANA said that during the protests, slogans have gone beyond economic demands and included criticism of governance and calls for justice. Protests have so far occurred in 27 provinces out of 31 and expanded to smaller cities, it said. The authorities have acknowledged economic hardships, but accused networks linked to foreign powers of pushing economic protests toward chaos and disorder, with the judiciary chief pledging to have no mercy toward rioters. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has urged dialogue and promised reforms to stabilise the monetary and banking systems and protect purchasing power. The government has announced a subsidy reform, removing preferential currency exchange rates for importers in favour of direct transfers to Iranians to boost their purchasing power for essential goods. The measure will come into force on Jan 10. The central bank chief was also replaced on Dec 29, 2025. The rial fell further to 1,489,500 on Jan 6, representing a 4 per cent fall since the protests started.

We are not occupying a country, this was a law enforcement operation, US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told an emergency meeting of the Security Council called to discuss the situation in Venezuela. Mr Waltz defended the US raid, arguing that Mr Maduro was the head of a narco-terrorist group that floods the US with drugs and profited off the misery of both Americans and Venezuelans, arguing that the US was acting on a pre-existing indictment. At the same time, Mr Waltz told the organisation that US President Donald Trump had tried other ways to get Mr Maduro to step down, calling him an illegitimate leader as well as a fugitive from justice. He reiterated the administrations claim that the US military action was about the countrys vast oil resources. You cannot continue to have the largest energy reserves in the world under the control of adversaries of the US, under the control of illegitimate leaders, Mr Waltz said. President Trump gave diplomacy a chance. He offered Maduro multiple off-ramps. Though US allies at the UN were mostly cautious in their remarks, Washington faced heat from a top UN official criticising the attack, saying it violated international law, could fuel instability in the region and sets a concerning precedent that could make violent conflicts more likely. I remain deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected, Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo said, noting that she was speaking on behalf of Secretary General Antonio Guterres. The UNs political chief issued a broad critique of the US raid in Caracas on Jan 3 that culminated with the capture of Mr Maduro, who is now awaiting trial in New York. Her comments reflect the broad concern among Washingtons allies following the US military action, as well as Mr Trumps fresh comments following the raid aboutseizing Greenland. Venezuelas envoy criticised the US action as a serious violation of international law and a blatant act of colonialism aimed at seizing his countrys strategic natural resources. Of particular seriousness is the kidnapping of the president of the republic, Mr Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta told the UN meeting, adding that it constitutes a direct violation of an essential norm of the international legal order, namely the personal immunity of heads of state in office. The US raid was also predictably condemned by Venezuelan allies Russia and China. Mr Vasily Nebenzya, Moscows envoy to the UN, said the assault on Caracas was a harbinger of a turn back to the era of lawlessness and US domination by force. He said the US did not try to hide that toppling Mr Maduro was motivated by a desire for unbridled control of Venezuelas vast oil resources. China was deeply shocked by the illegal and bullying US actions, Beijings Chargé dAffaires Sun Lei said. No country can act as the worlds police, he told the meeting. Some US allies, such as France and Denmark, emphasised the importance of following international law, but acknowledged the threat posed by Mr Maduro. At the same time, the UK focused on the harm Mr Maduro caused Venezuela, and emphasised securing a prosperous future for the country – with only a brief mention that countries should adhere to the UN charter. Argentinas envoy Francisco Fabian Tropepi had some of the warmest words for the US action, calling Mr Trumps move in Venezuela a decisive step that could help improve the country.

Mr Rubio, 54, emerged Jan 4 as the administrations chief public voice on Venezuela, laying out hints of strategy after the US swooped into Caracas to remove President Nicolas Maduro and fly him to New York for trial. The US raid on Jan 3suggests that the former US senator from Florida – long one of the most vocal policymakers on Venezuela – won out with his scepticism about negotiating with Mr Maduro, whom the US considered an illegitimate president and accuses of narco-terrorism that killed Americans. With questions swirling about how the US will deal with Venezuelas post-Maduro leadership, Mr Rubio demanded that they sever ties with Iran, Hezbollah and Cuba, stop drug trafficking and ensure that its oil industry does not benefit US adversaries. Theres a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments – theres a boat, and that boat is under US sanctions, we go get a court order – we will seize it, Mr Rubio said on CBS Face The Nation. Thats a tremendous amount of leverage for the US to press for change in Venezuela, he said. It is a moment Mr Rubio has been building towards since growing up in a Cuban exile community in Miami known for anti-communist and anti-authoritarian fervour. His father joined an attempt to oust right-wing Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1947, and a young Mr Rubio role-played with his grandfather about overthrowing Cubas communist rulers, according to his 2012 autobiography An American Son. On Jan 4, Mr Rubio drew an arc back to Cuba, which has been supporting its economy with cheap oil from Mr Maduros Venezuela. Asked on NBCs Meet The Press whether Cuba is the Trump administrations next target, Mr Rubio declined to speculate – but called the Cuban government a huge problem and said he thinks theyre in a lot of trouble. Mr Maduros internal security apparatus is entirely controlled by Cubans, Mr Rubio said. If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, Id be concerned, Mr Rubio said alongside Mr Trump at a Jan 3 news conference. Mr Trump opened the door to Mr Rubios fresh prominence when he told a news conference the US would now run Venezuela as he was flanked on the podium by Mr Rubio, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A US official said Mr Rubio – who has spent his career criticising Mr Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez – would take the leading administration role. While Mr Trump prompted questions about how the US would run Venezuela without a presence on the ground, Mr Rubio suggested that would involve a continuing pressure campaign now focused on acting President Delcy Rodriguez. Its running policy, he told NBC. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction because not only do we think its good for the people of Venezuela, its in our national interest. Mr Trump issued a warning on Jan 4 to Ms Rodríguez, who had called for Mr Maduros release. If she doesnt do whats right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro, he told the Atlantic magazine. Steeped in the regions politics, Mr Rubio seemed in line to become the top Latin America policymaker when Mr Trump nominated him as secretary of state in 2025. Even so, conflicting priorities within the administration over engaging with Mr Maduro played out in the build-up to last weeks raid. The US wanted him to accept Venezuelan deportees and US companies sought to bolster energy production from Venezuela, an OPEC member. Now Mr Rubio appears to have come out on top of the administrations internal debate over its approach to Latin America. At the same time, he has become a loyal Trump lieutenant, a decade after fighting him for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. From his early days as secretary of state, Mr Rubio pressed Latin American governments to confront drug cartels, curb Chinas influence and stop undocumented migration. On Jan 4, Mr Rubio expanded on the administrations strategy of relying on an oil quarantine to bring about change in Venezuela, backed by a large US naval deployment. The US already interdicted at least three large oil tankers in the Atlantic and Caribbean waters around Venezuela and surrounding countries in December. The important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on is the economy fuelled by oil, he said on Face The Nation. The US blockade on sanctioned oil shipments remains in place until we see changes that do not just further the national interest of the United States, which is No. 1, but also that lead to a better future for the Venezuelan people, he said. Mr Trump suggested on Jan 3 that US oil companies would spend billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuelas oil industry. Mr Rubio said a global shortage of heavy crude could spur that transition. I havent spoken to US oil companies in the last few days, but were pretty certain that there will be dramatic interest from Western companies, Mr Rubio said on ABCs This Week. Non-Russian, non-Chinese companies will be very interested. Our refineries on the Gulf Coast of the United States are the best in terms of refining this heavy crude. There will be tremendous interest – if it can be done the right way, he said. Mr Rubio sidestepped a question on CBS on when Venezuela might hold elections as part of a transition to democracy. Were going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim and on what they do moving forward, he said.

Over the past few days, flights in and out of Yemen had been largely restricted following a flare-up of violence between rival armed factions loosely grouped under the government but separatelybacked by the United Arab Emirates(UAE)and Saudi Arabia. An official at the airport on the island of Socotra told AFP on Jan 6 that the 416 stranded tourists would be able to leave from Jan 7 via Yemenia Airways flights to Aden, then on to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The airport in Aden on the mainland has been functional since Jan 4 after disruptions that lasted for several days. The stranded tourists had arrived from the UAEs Abu Dhabi airport via Air Arabia, an Emirati airline. But the Yemeni and Saudi governments have prohibited direct flights from the UAE to Yemen, including those bound for Socotra after the UAE- and Saudi-backed groups clashed over territory, the official said. The tourists include at least 60 Russians, he said, with a Western diplomat telling AFP other nationalities were present, including French, British and American citizens. In a Facebook post on Jan 6, the Russian embassy to Yemen shared details for a US$700 (S$895) Yemenia Airways flight from Socotra to Jeddah scheduled for Jan 7. More flights on the same route are planned later, but for now there is no precise information, it added. With its lush landscape, distinctive dragon blood trees, unique animals and turquoise waters, Yemens Socotra archipelago has been a magnet for adventurous travellers for years. Many set off from the wealthy UAE, the main backer of the separatist Southern Transitional Council forces that control the islands. The Saudis and Emiratis have for years supported rival factions in Yemens fractious Aden-based government, which has been held together by its opposition to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the north. In December, the UAE-backed separatists seized much of the south, expelling Saudi-backed government forces and their allies in a move that sparked fighting and Saudi air strikes. In recent days, Saudi-backed government forces have retaken much of the land that was seized.

Opening arguments were to begin Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency services, saying they were in the room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies. Gonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said that he failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter and that he also failed to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire. Each count carries the possibility of two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales attorney, Nico LaHood, has said that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate. Pedro Pete Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled. State and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with children while weighing how to confront him. By the time a tactical team led by Border Patrol officers stormed in, the toll had reached among the worst in the history of a country known for high-profile school shootings. Debates between proponents of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized nations. Former U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024, said that lives would have been saved had the police immediately confronted the gunman.

"Tourists on remote Yemeni island stranded after Saudi, UAE rift","Jan 06, 2026, 06:31 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 06:31 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/af3dcca1b17c7f6175333a3948ec764f58862e41cda9642fd6eaeed18f4aea19,"Tourists stand outside a hotel in the Socotra Island, Yemen, January 5, 2026. REUTERS/Stringer","['United Arab Emirates', 'Yemen', 'Saudi Arabia']","DUBAI, Jan 6 - When the United Arab Emirates withdrew its troops from Yemen last week under a deadline from Saudi Arabia, it also left behind the remote Yemeni island of Socotra and the roughly 600 tourists who had flown in but could no longer fly out. Air traffic at the islands main airport came to a halt as a deepening crisis between the UAE and Saudi Arabia translated into fresh conflict on Yemens mainland, where the two Gulf powers now back opposing groups in the countrys civil war. Nobody has any information and everyone just wants to go back to their normal lives, said Aurelija Krikstaponiene, a Lithuanian who travelled to Socotra over New Years Eve. She was meant to fly back to Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but now may find herself having to travel through Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead, as Emirati control over the island wanes. AN UNSINKABLE AIRCRAFT CARRIER Socotra, which lies more than 300 km (186 miles) south of Yemens coast, and until recently was mainly accessible by air via the UAE, has been a haven of tranquillity through the years of conflict on the mainland. For tourists, it offers magical beaches and unique flora, such as its renowned Socotra dragon blood tree. It sits in the Gulf of Aden, alongside a shipping route leading to the Red Sea. But Socotra came under effective UAE control in 2018 when Emirati military transport planes first landed on the island. The tanks and troops that unloaded were part of the UAEs push to extend its sway over the regions waters, including the Bab al-Mandab Strait between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. A major oil producer and business hub, the UAE has in the past decade pursued an assertive foreign policy, carving its own sphere of influence in the Middle East and beyond, often using its financial clout to serve its interests. Socotra functions like an unsinkable aircraft carrier sitting at the heart of the Bab al-Mandab system, in the middle of the trade corridor that links Europe, Asia and Africa, said Andreas Krieg, associate professor at Kings College London. Even without firing a shot, an actor with reliable access to the island gains important leverage: to observe, to potentially intercept and project influence. Less than eight years on, that plan is being derailed by the severest public rift the UAE has had with its fellow Gulf ally and oil-power Saudi Arabia. The two Gulf countries have navigated many differences in the past, from geopolitcs to oil output, but this latest fallout has brought their disagreements out in the open. SAUDI, EMIRATI RIFT OVER YEMEN REACHES FAR-OFF SOCOTRA Saudi Arabia has been carrying out airstrikes to aid Yemeni government troops against UAE-backed southern separatists, the same ones who run Socotra. UAE troops were not initially welcome when they first landed in 2018, with the Saudi-backed Yemeni government accusing Abu Dhabi of seizing the islands ports and airports. But the UAE exerted control through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) which now finds itself in direct confrontation with the Saudi-backed government forces on mainland Yemen. The STC seeks autonomy for southern Yemen, and ultimately independence, from the more heavily populated north. The STC is still in control of the island today but the airport is no longer under Emirati control, two airport sources told Reuters. The facility remains shut. Yemeni airlines said late on Monday it would operate a flight to Jeddah on January 7, a sure sign that control of the airport has shifted. On an island where air access often becomes the decisive gateway, influence over connectivity translates into influence over everything else, including security presence, local governance, and commercial life, Krieg said. The UAE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether all of its troops had left the island. One source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the troops left last month. Saudi Arabias government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on control of the airport. We have a limited amount of cash, and most people will run out in two or three days, Maciej, a Polish tourist who is part of a group of 100 others, told Reuters. There are no payment terminals or ATMs here and bank transfers are also inoperable. Everything relies on cash. When it runs out, well be sleeping rough and relying on food aid from local residents, he said, adding that he was not warned about the probability of conflict when he booked his trip. FROM SLEEPY ISLAND TO NICHE TOURISM With the Emirati presence since 2018 came money poured into infrastructure projects through the Sheikh Khalifa Foundation humanitarian organisation, bringing electricity, safe water and cooking gas to Socotra. The UAE also renovated the main airport, adding new buildings, two hangars and a modern navigation system for the control towers. The once sleepy island turned into a niche tourist destination where travellers looking for terrain off the beaten track could book packages solely through Abu Dhabi to experience the islands beaches and wildlife. Many did not factor in the risk of proximity to turmoil in Yemen, one of the worlds worst humanitarian disasters. Socotra, which is closer to Somalia than it is to Yemen, had so far been isolated from the civil war that has ravaged the mainland for over 10 years. But this latest flare-up may not spare its peace. Still, Romanian Bianca Cus is trying to enjoy the remainder of her time on the island until a flight comes in. I am enjoying each day on the island, just as I did before we found out that we would be staying longer, she said.

Forum: Maduros capture signals that rules-based order may be at risk,"Jan 06, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 06, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Politics and government', 'US politics']","For decades, the global system has been described as rules-based –anchored in sovereignty, multilateral institutions and agreed norms of behaviour. While imperfect, this framework provided a measure ofpredictability, restraint and a shared language for managing disputes. Recent events –including the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the United States – have brought this underlying shift into sharper focus. Regardless of ones views of the individual involved, the episode raises broader questions about sovereignty and the extent to which power, rather than multilateral process, now shapes international outcomes. This does not represent a sudden collapse of international law or a descent into global anarchy. Rather, it signals a gradual recalibration. Rules continue to exist, but their application appears increasingly selective and contingent. For small and middle powers, this evolution is especially consequential. A rules-based order offered protection through predictability; a power-based environment demands resilience through adaptability. This transition is also reshaping perceptions of risk. Investors, boards and policymakers now incorporate geopolitics more explicitly into decisions once governed primarily by economics. Importantly, this is not simply a binary contest between rival blocs. Many countries are choosing neither alignment nor confrontation, but pragmatic hedging. For Singapore, the implications are nuanced. Our longstanding support for multilateralism and international law remains vital – not as ideology, but as national interest. At the same time, realism requires recognising that institutions alone cannot guarantee outcomes. Capability, credibility and consistency matter more than ever. We may not be witnessing the end of the rules-based order, but we are clearly seeing the end of the assumption that rules operate independently of power. Navigating this environment will require clear-eyed realism and sustained effort to ensure that strength ultimately serves stability.

Fernandez from AWARE for raising the important issue of access to the employment dispute resolution process at the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) (Taking employers to task for discrimination: How easy is the legal process?, Dec 29). Transient Workers Count Too has, over the years, assisted many low-wage migrant workers throughout the ECT process –from initial filing to final resolution – pursuing salary and wrongful dismissal claims. As the article notes, the ECT process can be complex and intimidating, especially for migrant workers who lack community support or face language and cultural barriers. We also wish to highlight the increasing length of the ECT process. In early 2024, the typical interval between claim registration and the first case management conference was about three weeks. In 2025, this doubled to six weeks. We have also seen hearings involving Burmese-speaking employees postponed by a month due to interpreter shortages. These delays prolong stress and defer resolution, often worsening employees financial and emotional hardship. We hope the relevant authorities give due attention to these resourcing and scheduling challenges so the ECT process remains timely, accessible and fair, particularly for those already structurally disadvantaged. We also support the articles call to broaden support for employees navigating the ECT process in anticipation of its jurisdiction expansion under the Workplace Fairness Act and the Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Act, highlighting where the ECT and the authorities can improve accessibility and address power imbalances. One practical example is the Community Courts and Tribunals (CCT) Friend Scheme. With tribunal approval, an employee may be accompanied by a CCT Friend who provides emotional and administrative support. Most employees are unaware of this option until we advise them. While CCT Friends cannot advocate for employees, they help explain instructions, take notes and locate documents. Our experience shows that this support empowers employees to participate fully in the process, leading to more equitable outcomes. We support efforts to encourage more organisations to provide such assistance on a pro bono basis, and strongly urge that vulnerable employees be referred to appropriate organisations early in the process.

When everything else breaks down, defence is the final insurance policy a country has. Many of us believe strongly in international law, diplomacy and global cooperation. These ideals matter, and they should continue to guide how nations behave. But we should not kid ourselves. When interests collide and rules are stretched or ignored, military strength still decides what a country can protect and what it cannot. This is why Singapore has made a clear and deliberate choice to spend the most on defence in its national budget, over $23 billion or 3 per cent of gross domestic product. A small country with no natural resources, but possessing significant wealth and strategic importance, cannot rely on goodwill alone to stay safe. Venezuela sits on the worlds largest oil reserves, yet without effective governance and a strong national defence, that wealth has become a vulnerability rather than a shield. Resources can be pressured, constrained or taken when a state lacks the ability to protect its own interests. For Singapore, the lesson is straightforward. Everything we have built – our economy, our infrastructure, our way of life – is secure only because it is defended. Defence is about ensuring that peace remains the most rational choice.

Suddenly, all those music videos by bands such as American rock groups Nirvana and R.E.M. that I had only read about in magazines and newspapers were right there on my living rooms television screen. My first proper introduction to the American channel was in 1992, when the then Singapore Broadcasting Corporations Channel 5 started airing two MTV programmes – MTVs Most Wanted and MTV Top Asian Top 20 – past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. Technically, it was not the real deal.MTVs 24/7 music video channel would make its official debut in Singapore on cable television only in 1995. Still, it was a watershed moment for music geeks like me. I would stay up late, one finger hovering over the record button on the VCR remote, ready to commit my favourite bands to tape so I could watch them again and again and again. So, when I read about how MTV officially ended its music video channels worldwide on Dec 31 after 44 years – the brand itself is still around through its reality television and digital content – it felt like the end of a defining cultural run. But it also came as no surprise, as the channel had long ceased to be the primary vehicle for music videos. And honestly, who would want to sit in front of thetelevision set waiting for ones favourite bands to come on, when music videos can now be watched on YouTube any time and anywhere? In an age of viral short-form videos on TikTok and Reels, snappy public conversations on X and Threads, and never-ending live streams, music videos do not have as much hold on mainstream pop culture as they did decades ago. That being said, the MTV brand will always hold a dear place in my heart. Watching the channel was a shared experience for a generation that grew up in a time when music discovery was a slow and communal experience. While the primary music listening experiences were audio-only mediums like cassettes, CDs and the radio, MTV played a big part in how genres – be it grunge, Britpop, hip-hop or pop – were enjoyed visually. From the cinematic drama of Guns N Roses November Rain (1992) and the raw, visceral energy of Nirvanas Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) to Michael and Janet Jacksons science-fiction epic Scream (1995) and Jamiroquais mind-bending Virtual Insanity (1996), watching a series of music videos on MTV back then felt like you were connected to the global youth culture. The VJs, or video jockeys,whohosted the local and regional MTV shows – such as Nadya Hutagalung, Jamie Aditya and Mike Kasem – became household names themselves. Starting in the late 1990s, MTVs presence went far beyond the television screen in Singapore, as the city-state was also MTV Asias operational base. In 2002, the inaugural MTV Asia Awards took place at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. While it was not populated with A-listers like the annual US-based MTV Video Music Awards, it did feature stars like American pop singer Pink, Irish boy band Westlife and J-pop queen Ayumi Hamasaki. The 2003 and 2004 editions were also held in Singapore, boasting global acts such as Mariah Carey and Linkin Park, as well as home-grown darling Stefanie Sun and Taiwans Jay Chou. Ironically, that was around the same time MTV in the US started to pivot away from music videos to focus more on wildly popular reality television shows such as Jackass (2000 to 2002), The Osbournes (2002 to 2005) and Pimp My Ride (2004 to 2007). In 2010, the channel officially dropped the words music television from its logo, marking the complete transition to a broader entertainment network focused on reality shows and pop culture. Closer to home, after years of reduced original programming, the main MTV Asia channel finally made its exit after StarHub TV discontinued it in 2022. The final music video that played when MTV pulled the plug on its music video channels on New Years Eve was The Buggles Video Killed The Radio Star (1979) – the same one used for the launch in 1981. A song about one medium replacing another, it reads more like a reminder that every innovation in how people consume music must eventually give way to something more contemporary.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/viewpoint-for-a-gen-x-music-geek-closing-mtvs-music-video-channels-marks-the-end-of-a-chapter

It also stars home-grown actor-comedians Xixi Lim, Wang Weiliang, Liu Lingling, Patricia Mok and Henry Thia.

9 Chinese makeup brands and their best C-Beauty products you need to know,"Jan 06, 2026, 04:00 AM","Jan 06, 2026, 10:07 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/64c4b9940fb9929e6b1ada0cb47e8c6eb9c64e98f2c624e895e7baaac0acca79,PHOTOS: JOOCYEE,"['Online shopping', 'Shopping', 'Beauty tips']","Once a niche corner of the internet, Chinese makeup brands are now taking over your FYP - and your vanity. From sculpted lipsticks that look like art pieces to glassy lip tints that sell out overnight, C-Beauty is having a serious moment. What does C-Beauty mean? The rise of C-beauty How does C-Beauty differ from K-Beauty or J-Beauty? How do you know if the C-Beauty product is safe and authentic? What are popular C-Beauty brands? C-Beauty - short for Chinese beauty - refers to cosmetics and skincare brands born in China that blend cultural heritage, innovative formulas, and striking visual design. Merging cutting-edge technology with storytelling rooted in Chinese art, mythology, and modern aesthetics, the result is an emerging beauty identity thats proudly original, expressive, and globally relevant. In the past few years, Chinese makeup brands have exploded on social media, captivating users with collectible packaging, new-gen textures, and clever formulations. FromFlorasiss intricately carved lipsticks toInto Yous viral lip muds, these C-Beauty labels capture the spirit of modern Chinese creativity - sophisticated yet accessible, luxurious yet experimental. Singapores beauty scene has quickly caught on, with many of these cult names now available through local retailers, e-commerce platforms, and even physical stores. While K-Beauty (Korean beauty) popularised dewy, glass-skin minimalism and J-Beauty (Japanese beauty) built its reputation on purity and precision, C-Beauty stands out for its artistry, cultural depth, and storytelling. If youre wondering what is the difference between K-Beauty and C-Beauty, here is how you can tell them apart. K-Beautys strength lies in innovation and routine-driven skincare, while J-Beauty focuses on refined textures and long-term care. In contrast, C-Beauty places strong emphasis on design, symbolism, and mood - makeup as an art form rather than a utility. Youll find influences from ancient Chinese paintings, poetry, and architecture translated into packaging and colour stories. Where Korean and Japanese beauty brands tend to champion subtlety, Chinese makeup brands arent afraid of maximalism. Many C-Beauty brands thrive on bold palettes, ornate compacts, and a sense of narrative. The rise of C-Beauty has, inevitably, come with growing pains. Counterfeit products and unregulated sellers occasionally surface online, especially through third-party marketplaces. The good news: Chinas beauty manufacturing standards have improved significantly over the past decade. Now, many Chinese makeup brands operate under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certifications and are subject to stricter oversight under Chinas Cosmetic Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR) implemented in 2021. Still, vigilance is key. Heres how to shop C-Beauty products safely in Singapore: Buy from official stores or verified platforms.Stick to official Shopee Mall, LazMall, or dedicated brand sites likeJoocyee SingaporeorPerfect Diarys Official Store. Check packaging details and batch codes.Authentic C-Beauty products usually include brand-verified seals or serial numbers you can cross-check online. Avoid prices that seem too good to be true.Counterfeits often undercut by large margins. Read reviews and ingredient lists.Many top C-Beauty brands now provide full INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) listings and safety documentation in English. When in doubt, purchase from authorised local retailers such asWatsons, Guardian, or beauty specialty stores that list their partnerships directly on brand websites.

The first overseas-produced animated feature centred on K-pop idols prevailed over fellow contenders including Zootopia 2, Elio, In Your Dreams and Arco. The triumph over traditional animation powerhouses such as Disney and Pixar has fuelled expectations that KPop Demon Hunters could post a strong showing at the Academy Awards on March 15. The 2026 Oscar nominations are set to be announced on Jan 22. Meanwhile, Squid Game continued its dominant Critics Choice streak with a third best foreign language series win for its third season. Squid Game first made history at the 2022 Critics Choice Awards, becoming the first South Korean drama to win best foreign language series. At the same ceremony, star Lee Jung-jae broke barriers as the first South Korean actor to win best actor in a drama series. The series repeated its success at the February 2025 ceremony, once again taking home the best foreign language series trophy following the second season. American-French actor Timothee Chalamets Oscars campaign earned a major boost as he scooped the best actor prize for Marty Supreme. He defeated American rival Leonardo DiCaprio, whose raucous political thriller One Battle After Another took the nights top prize for best picture, as well as best director and best adapted screenplay for American film-maker Paul Thomas Anderson. In Marty Supreme, Chalamet plays a 1950s table tennis champion consumed by grand ambitions. Loosely based on the life of table tennis star Marty Reisman, a man driven by the belief that he can achieve fame and fortune through a sport little known in the United States, the film directed by American Josh Safdie has become an unlikely global hit. Josh, you made a story about a flawed man with a relatable dream, said Chalamet, who rigorously trained in table tennis for the role, in his acceptance speech. And you didnt preach to the audience about whats right and wrong, and I think we should all be telling stories like that, so thank you for this dream. The 30-year-old two-time Oscar nominee has in the past made no secret of his ambitions to win multiple Academy Awards, and will now be the front-runner. Irish actress Jessie Buckley won best actress for her tragic role as the wife of William Shakespeare in the period drama Hamnet. Australian actor Jacob Elordi won best supporting actor for his portrayal of the Monster in Frankenstein, which also picked up three technical awards. American actress Amy Madigan won supporting actress for a villainous turn in horror flick Weapons. Among the television prizes, hospital saga The Pitt won best drama, Hollywood satire The Studio won best comedy and teen murder drama Adolescence won best limited series. Best talk-show winner Jimmy Kimmel of Jimmy Kimmel Live! joked about his 2025spat with US President Donald Trump, which saw the late-night host briefly taken off the air. Thank you, Mr President, for all the many ridiculous things you do each and every day, said the American TV host. A Fifa Peace Prize would have been better, but this is nice too. The acclaimed Critics Choice Awards are presented annually by the American Critics Choice Association, an organisation comprising roughly 600 broadcast, film and TV critics and journalists from the US and Canada. Held early each year, the ceremony recognises outstanding achievements across film and television, and is often viewed as an early indicator of momentum heading into major awards races, including the Emmys.

The STI gained 1.27 per cent or 59.47 points to finish at 4,739.97, after 1.71 billion securities worth $1.78 billion changed hands. OCBC crossed $20 for the first time, closing at a new high of $20.18, while DBS jumped to a new high of $57.93. Investors cannot afford to ignore the Singapore stock market, Ms Carmen Lee, head of equity research at OCBC Group Research, said at OCBCs annual Premier Private Client Investment seminar at the Ritz-Carlton on Jan 6. The STI outperformed the US S&P 500 in 2025, and closed the year up 22.7 per cent, after notching new highs for eight consecutive months, she noted in a Jan 5 research note. The last time this happened was in 2006-2007. Local stocks got a big boost from regulatory initiatives such as the Equity Market Development Programme (EQDP),which pooled $5 billion with selected fund managers to invest in locally listed companies. The second and latest batch of six asset managers has been appointed to oversee $2.85 billion under the EQDP, bringing total allocations to $3.95 billion so far, with $1.05 billion still to be deployed. A lot of regional investors are in Singapore stocks.A number ofsmall and mid-cap stocks did exceptionally well (in 2025), and there will be more focus on this space in 2026, Ms Lee said. She added that the STI could rise further as valuations improve in 2026. (Local) banks will still see a good year. In the last two years, banks were driven by interest income. But in 2026 and 2027, capital market activity or new IPOs could provide a second wind. Despite market volatility, financial stocks closed 2025 with an average gain of 20.7 per cent, as banks surprised the market with stronger-than-expected earnings, Ms Lee said in her Jan 5 research note. The outlook for 2026 suggests that bank earnings should remain steady even as lending margins narrow, supported by strong growth in wealth management activity and healthy returns, she said. Bull markets usually last five to six years, with the market currently in its third year of the cycle, said Mr Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC. Even as concerns remain over inflation, tariff uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and the US Federal Reserves independence under the Trump administration, Mr Menon said he believes that the outlook is still benign and market pullbacks are opportunities to buy. On the impact of higher US tariffs, Ms Selina Ling, chief economist at OCBC Bank, the US bark has been worst than its bite. Despite the lingering threat of US semiconductor tariffs and pharmaceuticals tariffs, she noted: We are not at risk of recession, but we will see a slowdown in many ASEAN countries including Singapore in 2026, mainly because the base growth was so high in 2025. Singapores manufacturing surged in the final quarter of 2025, driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-related semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, which helped the economy achieve better than expected full-year growth of 4.8 per cent. Things could hold up if the AI boom continues, finance and insurance (sectors) continues to do well and (tourists and MICE) visitors keep coming, she said. Local brokerage house UOB KayHian is also bullish on its outlook for Singapore stocks, citing continued tailwinds from the EQDP and a return to earnings growth for many local stocks. Following first-half results and third-quarter business updates in 2025, most companies saw upgrades to earnings expectations, and this momentum is likely to continue into 2026. On the back of this earnings growth, we forecast a year-end target of 5,000 for the STI in 2026, UOB KayHian analyst Adrian Loh said in a Jan 2 research note. Property, land transport, healthcare and plantation sectors are expected to see double-digit percentage increases in earnings. In particular, the property sector, which comprises CapitaLand Investment and City Developments, could benefit from improving operating conditions and recurring income growth, a recovery in key markets, as well as macro environment tailwinds, Mr Loh said. Financials and telecommunications sectors are also expected to post 1.2 per cent and 9.6 per cent earnings growth, respectively, in 2026. Despite fears of net interest margin compression, the local banking sectors earnings held up extremely well in 2025 and should continue to be buoyed by the wealth management industry, while the telecommunications sector should benefit from stabilisation of core services and improved operator profitability, Mr Loh said. Given the prevalence of blue-chip defensive stocks with strong cash flow generation and relatively high dividend yields, the Singapore market will continue to attract fund flows, he added. Undergirding the local markets strength, the Singapore economy grew surprisingly well in 2025, due to stronger contributions from the manufacturing, commerce and finance sectors, UOB KayHian said. For 2026, UOB Global Economics and Markets Research forecasts GDP growth of 2.1 per cent, which is at the higher end of MTIs forecast of 1 per cent to 3 per cent.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/sti-hits-new-record-high-of-over-4700-points-may-reach-5000-in-2026

Speaking at an investment seminar for OCBCs private clients on Jan 6, the banks chief economist Selena Ling said the low inflation seen in 2025 may creep up slightly in 2026, but there is no urgency for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to change its policy stance of allowing the Singdollar to gently appreciate. Its very likely they will keep it unchanged. That means that the slope of the S$NEER is going to be slightly positive, she said, referring to the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate. The Singapore dollar will appreciate modestly against regional currencies, and its good news for all of you because that means that the Singdollar will strengthen against, whether it is Japanese yen or some other countries, she added. Ms Ling noted that the Republic is in a sweet spot in 2026, given strong economic growth, resilient domestic demand and a stable monetary environment. The Singapore economy expanded 4.8 per cent in 2025 – topping the Governments forecast of 4 per cent. It was the economys best performance since 2021s 9.8 per cent, when it bounced back from the pandemic-induced 2020 recession. Calling 2025 a stunning year of growth, Ms Ling noted that there is a chance the Singapore economy may even exceed 3 per cent growth in 2026. If the artificial intelligence boom continues, if we continue to see finance and insurance do well, if we continue to see visitor arrivals, we may have a slightly better than even chance of exceeding the upper end of the official forecast of 1 per cent to 3 per cent year on year, she said. She noted that ASEAN performed well amid US tariff uncertainties in 2025, even as the market predicted that the front-loading of exports in the first half of the year would result in a payback in the second half. The payback never happened. If anything, the second half was even stronger than the first half. The whole AI-related boom, data centre boom, has benefited a lot of countries. But I think, in general, we also saw that interest rates were coming down. Domestic consumption was relatively resilient, she said. However, many ASEAN countries, including Singapore, might see a slowdown in 2026 largely due to big surprises on the growth side in 2025, she added. In the US, OCBC expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least once in 2026. But whether there will be more than one cut this year or down the road, it depends on where inflation goes. The Fed is going to have a new chairman who is very likely to also be more dovish, she said. Mr Jerome Powells term as Fed chairmanis set to end in May. The US Federal Reserve cut rates three times in 2025 to a range of 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent while projecting one more cut for 2026 amid softening labour and persistent inflation. The rate cuts led the US dollar to underperform, said Ms Ling. In 2026, OCBC expects the US dollar to soften moderately. However, US policy uncertainties, as well as increasing US debt levels, could weigh on the US dollar, said Ms Ling. But if the Fed decides to pause rate cuts, it would give the US dollar some support, she noted, adding that the US dollar also tends to benefit whenever there is a big growth or geopolitical crisis. We have a very benign outlook. We dont think the US is really at risk of a recession this year. Within most of the major economies, we will see fairly stable growth.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/singdollar-could-continue-to-strengthen-against-regional-currencies-in-2026-ocbc-chief-economist

Investment banking fees rose 28.9 per cent in 2025 from a year agoto reach US$864.6 million (S$1.1 billion), the highest annual total since 2021, according to the London Stock Exchange Groups (LSEG) Deals Intelligence team. Advisory fees from completed M&A transactions amounted to US$265.1 million, up 55.3 per cent from 2024. Equity capital markets (ECM) underwriting fees more than doubled to US$210.9 million, the strongest showing since 2021. Debt capital markets fees also recorded a historic jump of 55.9 per cent to US$155.2 million, marking the highest level on record. By contrast, syndicated lending fees fell 24.1 per cent to US$233.4 million. Home-grown DBS Group retained its position as Singapores leading investment bank, generating US$72.9 million in fees to capture an 8.4 per cent market share of the total fee pool. Despite the robust fee performance, overall M&A activity involving Singapore slowed. The total value of deals reached US$70.4 billion in 2025, down 9.1 per cent from 2024. The number of announced transactions fell 22.1 per cent to a 10-year low. At least fifteen deals worth over US$1 billion were announced in 2025, with a combined value of US$27.8 billion, though activity tapered off towards the end of the year as only one mega-deal was unveiled in the fourth quarter. Deals targeting Singapore companies rose 8.4 per cent to US$26.9 billion, underpinned by foreign investor interest. Inbound M&A activity, where a foreign company buys a local one, jumped 16 per cent to US$19.2 billion. Domestic M&A activity slipped 6.7 per cent to US$7.8 billion. Outbound M&A, where a Singapore company targets a foreign one, fell 7.2 per cent to US$22.6 billion, the lowest level in a decade. From a sector perspective, energy and power was the most targeted industry, accounting for 17.4 per cent of the total deal value at US$12.2 billion, roughly double the level in 2024. Real estate ranked second with US$10.3 billion, down 4.2 per cent from 2024. High technology followed closely with US$9.8 billion, up 37.6 per cent from the preceding year. Swiss banking giant UBS topped the league table for M&A transactions involving Singapore, advising on deals worth US$8.3 billion and taking an 11.8 per cent market share. Singapores equity capital markets slowed in the final quarter of 2025, raising US$1.7 billion, a 33.2 per cent decline from the previous three months. Despite thelostmomentum in the fourth quarter, total ECM proceeds in 2025 reached US$7.4 billion, more than double the amount raised during 2024 and the best annual total since 2021. The number of issues also rose by 66.7 per cent compared to 2024. A total of 38 initial public offerings (IPOs) by Singaporean companies were issued in 2025, raising US$2.5 billion. Of these, 27 IPOs were listed offshore – two in Hong Kong and 25 in the United States– raising a combined US$662.1 million. Eleven issuers chose to list on the Singapore Exchange, generating US$1.9 billion in proceeds. Real estate players were the biggest contributors to ECM volumes, accounting for 42.7 per cent of proceeds, or US$3.2 billion, aided by capital raisings from listed real estate investment trusts. The high technology sector followed, securing a 33.2 per cent share worth US$2.5 billion, while healthcare issuers contributed 10.4 per cent of total proceeds. DBS Group secured the top spot in Singapores domestic equity and equity-linked underwriting league table for 2025, with US$983.6 million in related proceeds. Singapores debt capital markets staged a strong performance in 2025, with total bond issuance by local entities reaching US$41.3 billion. This is up 30.5 per cent from 2024 and the second-highest annual total since records began in 1980. Financial institutions dominated activity, capturing 64.8 per cent of the market and raising US$26.7 billion, a 47.5 per cent increase from 2024. This is bolstered by large bank issuances, including several from DBS and United Overseas Bank. Government and agencies accounted for 17.4 per cent of the market, with proceeds of US$7.2 billion, down 0.6 per cent from 2024. Real estate raised US$1.9 billion, a 27.1 per cent growth from 2024.

Samsung likely to flag 160% jump in Q4 profit as AI boom stokes chip prices,"Jan 06, 2026, 10:06 AM","Jan 06, 2026, 11:14 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/af575bdcf08ca5b095d5a898144da8aafb67b1a0014a5a0d117df74b82e3ab16,"Chip prices have rocketed in recent months, as the industrys shift to AI-related chips has curbed production for traditional memory.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Samsung', 'Semiconductors', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'Smartphones']","SEOUL-Samsung Electronics is expected to flag a 160 per cent jump in its fourth-quarter operating profit, spurred by a severe chip shortage that has sharply driven up memory prices as customers scramble to meet booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Semiconductor prices have rocketed in recent months, as the industrys shift to AI-related chips has curbed production for traditional memory, while demand has been surging for both conventional and advanced chips to train and run AI models. Samsung is likely to estimate an operating profit of 16.9 trillion won (S$14.9 billion) for the October to December period, according to LSEG SmartEstimate from 31 analysts. This compares with 6.49 trillion won from a year earlier, and would mark the highest quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2018, which was a record high of 17.6 trillion won. Some analysts have in recent weeks raised their estimates for Samsungs fourth-quarter operating profit to more than 20 trillion won on the back of stronger-than-expected prices of traditional chips. The worlds top memory chip maker is set to release its estimates for revenue and operating profit on Jan 8. Prices for a type of DDR5 DRAM chip jumped 314 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to data from market researcher TrendForce. It expects conventional DRAM contract prices to rise 55 per cent to 60 per cent in the current quarter, from the October to December period. As conventional DRAM prices continue to surge, Samsung – whose production capacity is largely concentrated in this segment – stands to gain relatively more from the current price upcycle, TrendForce analyst Avril Wu said. DRAM chips are used in servers, computers and smartphones to temporarily store data and help run programs and applications smoothly and swiftly. DDR5 DRAM, a conventional chip, is faster and more efficient than its predecessor. In December, Micron Technology forecast second-quarter adjusted profit at nearly double Wall Street estimates. Micron chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said he expects memory markets to remain tight past 2026, and that in the medium term, it expects to meet only half to two-thirds of demand from several key customers. Samsungs booming profit marks a dramatic turnaround, just over a year after CEO Jun Young-hyun apologised for the companys disappointing earnings and performance as it lagged its cross-town rival SK Hynix in supplying high-end chips to Nvidia, the dominant maker of AI processors. Samsung shares jumped 125 per cent in 2025, marking their biggest annual percentage gain in 26 years. On Jan 2, Mr Jun said Samsung customers have praised the competitive edge of its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, or HBM4, quoting them as saying Samsung is back, which helped extend a rally in Samsungs shares to record highs in recent sessions. He did not elaborate on those customers, but analysts said Samsung is making progress supplying chips to Nvidia, potentially gaining share against SK Hynix and Micron. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Jan 5 the companys next generation of chips is in full production. The Vera Rubin platform, which will incorporate HBM4 chips, is on track to arrive later in 2026, Nvidia said. Analysts said Samsungs operating profit is expected to more than double in 2026 to more than 100 trillion won, as the chip price rally would more than offset slowing profit for its mobile business. Mr Lee Min-hee, an analyst at BNK Investment & Securities, said he was wary of Samsungs valuations, as surging chip prices may sap demand for PCs and smartphones, and cited risks of a demand slowdown for AI data centres increasingly relying on debt to finance investments. While the global shortage of memory chips is a boon to Samsungs mainstay semiconductor business, soaring chip prices are squeezing margins in its smartphone division, its second-largest revenue source. As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact, Samsung co-CEO TM Roh, who oversees Samsungs mobile, TV and home appliance businesses, told Reuters, adding it is trying to minimise the impact, which looks inevitable.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/samsung-likely-to-flag-160-jump-in-q4-profit-as-ai-boom-stokes-chip-prices

This will raise the portfolio occupancy of the pure-play data centre real estate investment trust (REIT) to 98 per cent, up from 81 per cent, said the mainboard-listed REIT. The agreement for the 10.8MW facility is expected to generate about US$14.8 million (S$19 million) in annualised net property income, or US$13.3 million based on the REITs 90 per cent share of the property. This represents a 35 per cent increase over its previous net rent, the REIT manager said. The REIT previously reported a net property income of US$67.7 million for the nine months ended Sept 30. The agreement commences on Dec 1. From then, the annualised rent contribution from investment-grade customers will go up to 82 per cent, from 79 per cent. The total portfolio weighted average lease expiration will be extended to 5.7 years, from 4.7 years currently. Mr John Stewart, chief executive of Digital Core REITs manager, said in a media briefing that the deal excludes tenant improvements, brokers from either side, leasing commission, rent-free periods and break clauses. He pointed out that the tenant will bear all of the fit-out costs; the agreement also includes a 3 per cent annual rental escalation clause with a no-break option for the tenant over the 10-year term. Digital Core REIT will invest about US$40 million in capital expenditure for redevelopment, which adds 13 per cent to the facilitys sellable capacity to 10.8MW, he added. Describing the deal as a strategic reset, he noted that the Linton Hall facility would account for 10 per cent of the REITs revenue. The facility has been sitting vacant since the previous tenant moved out of the facility on June 30, he added. Responding to queries from The Business Times, Mr Stewart said that the REIT seeks to continue delivering organic growth, particularly through its two assets in Los Angeles, California. We have two co-location facilities in Los Angeles, where we have both some existing vacancy and some opportunity to replicate our model by densifying or investing in the facility and bringing on a little bit of additional sellable capacity, he said. Based on its portfolio summary, the weighted average occupancy of Digital Core REITs Los Angeles portfolio stood at 90.5 per cent as at Sept 30. However, the REIT is not ruling out inorganic growth through acquisitions. Mr Stewart pointed out that it has US$15 billion in its acquisition pipeline from its sponsor, Digital Realty. We certainly have opportunities to invest and acquire, generate inorganic growth through acquisitions, he said. The counter had announced a trading halt on Jan 2, before the announcement. Units of Digital Core REIT were unchanged at 9.15am on Jan 6, after rising 6.9 per cent to 54.5 US cents on Jan 5.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/digital-core-reit-bags-10-year-lease-at-its-us-facility-portfolio-occupancy-rises-to-98-from-81

The traders account on Polymarket built up positions in contracts tied to Maduros removal on terms that implied long odds before the weekend raid. Those wagers, which were worth about US$34,000 prior to Maduros capture, surged in value after news of the US military operation against the Venezuelan leader emerged, Polymarket data shows. The mystery trade is likely to attract scrutiny from US lawmakers who have been pushing for stricter insider trading rules, including a bipartisan effort to potentially ban trading of stocks by lawmakers. After news of the Maduro trades emerged on Jan 5, Democratic congressman Ritchie Torres said he plans to introduce a Bill this week that would bar elected officials, lawmakers and federal employees who could potentially access material non-public information from placing bets on prediction market platforms. The anonymous account was created in December, with the trader buying up US$96 worth of contracts on Dec 27 that would pay off if the US invaded Venezuela by Jan 31. The trader then made several more similar bets in the following days. Prediction markets like Polymarket offer tradable yes-or-no contracts that allow users to bet on a wide range of real-world events, ranging from outcomes across sports and entertainment to politics and the economy. When a contract priced at a few cents pays out at US$1, traders who have access to non-public information tied to such contracts can rake in massive profits within hours or days. In September, Polymarket secured approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to relaunch its operations in the country, following its US$112 million acquisition of QCEX, a CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange and clearing house. The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it was looking into trades related to Maduros capture. Polymarket has previously faced scrutiny on potential insider trading on the platform. While Americans at present do not have access to the main betting platform, many traders use virtual private networks to get around the ban. Polymarket did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Major stock indexes jumped and oil prices gained earlier on Jan 5, while energy shares notched big gains after Maduro was captured by the US military. In Venezuela, the countrys default-hit government bonds also surged, buoyed by expectations of a large and complex sovereign-debt restructuring. Bonds issued by the government and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, jumped as much as 10 cents on the dollar, or almost 30 per cent, as bullish investors swooped on the developments.

All six of the new Rubin chips are back from manufacturing partners, and they have already passed some of the milestone tests that show they are on track for deployment by customers, Nvidia said. Chief executive Jensen Huang touted the products during a keynote presentation at the CES 2026 trade show in Las Vegas on Jan 5. The race is on for AI, he said. Everybodys trying to get to the next level. Mr Huangs remarks signal that Nvidia is maintaining its edge as the leading maker of AI accelerators, the chips used by data centre operators to develop and run AI models. Rubin is Nvidias latest accelerator and is 3.5 times better at training and five times better at running AI software than its predecessor, Blackwell, the company said. A new central processing unit has 88 cores – the key data-crunching elements – and provides twice the performance of the component that it is replacing. The company is giving details of its new products earlier in the year than it typically does – part of a push to keep the industry hooked on its hardware, which has underpinned an explosion in AI use. Nvidia usually dives into product details at its spring GTC event in San Jose, California. For Mr Huang, CES is yet another stop on his marathon run of appearances at events, where he has announced products, tie-ups and investments all aimed at adding momentum to the deployment of AI systems. Some on Wall Street have expressed concern that competition is mounting for Nvidia – and that AI spending cannot continue at its current pace. Data centre operators also are developing their own AI accelerators. But Nvidia has maintained bullish long-term forecasts that point to a total market in the trillions of dollars. The new hardware, which also includes networking and connectivity components, will be part of its DGX SuperPod supercomputer while also being available as individual products for customers to use in a more modular way. The step-up in performance is needed because AI has shifted to more specialised networks of models that not only sift through massive amounts of inputs, but need to solve particular problems through multistage processes. The company emphasised that Rubin-based systems will be cheaper to run than Blackwell versions because they will return the same results using smaller numbers of components. Microsoft and other large providers of remote computing will be among the first to deploy the new hardware in the second half of the year, Nvidia said. For now, the majority of spending on Nvidia-based computers is coming from the capital expenditure budgets of a handful of customers, including Microsoft, Alphabets Google Cloud and Amazon.coms AWS. Nvidia is pushing software and hardware aimed at broadening the adoption of AI across the economy, including robotics, healthcare and heavy industry. As part of that effort, Nvidia announced a group of tools designed to accelerate development of autonomous vehicles and robots.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/nvidia-ceo-says-new-rubin-chips-on-track-helping-speed-ai

I saw some videos of bicycles doing slalom in a slalom course, Eliasch told Reuters. Sure, you can invent anything, but quite frankly, water skiing would have more to do with the Olympic Winter Games than this. At least its sliding, and its key, right? The International Cycling Union (UCI) has been campaigning for the addition of cyclocross, a sport where races are often contested in brutal weather and sometimes snow, to the 2030 Winter Games programme in the French Alps. Eliasch said straying too far from the Winter Games core identity risks weakening their appeal rather than broadening it. What is so important - and I have been developing brands and formats my entire life - is that if youre not true to your brand and your brand identity, the appreciation of the brand goes downhill, he said. We are snow and ice. Its even in the Olympic Charter, Eliasch added. Im not saying here that we shouldnt be open to all possibilities, but clearly what we should focus on first is to make sure that we have the best athletes with the best performance of the best sports. Its quality, not quantity. Quantity will not sell the Winter Games. He said the Olympic movement already struggles to guarantee elite-level competition in some sports. We have issues, for instance, in ice hockey. We dont have the best ice hockey players because of the situation here with the NHL, Eliasch said. The same with football. Theres another good example where we dont have the best football players. For Eliasch, the priority must be delivering excellence to viewers and spectators. For the Olympic movement, it is really important to make sure that we have the highest quality of what you see on the screen or you see as a spectator, he said. The highest quality - that is the best venues, the best fan experience. He added that winter sports must also think beyond the Olympic fortnight. It is also super important to focus on how we are not only relevant two weeks every two years but how we can be relevant to Olympic fans every day, every week, Eliasch said.

The 41-year-old Englishman has signed a deal until 2032, becoming the fourth full-time head coach appointed since a takeover of the club led by American Todd Boehly in 2022. I am extremely humbled and honoured to be appointed head coach of Chelsea Football Club, Rosenior, who leaves his post at French club Racing Strasbourg, said in a club statement. This is a club with a unique spirit and a proud history of winning trophies. London-born Rosenior, whose playing career included spells at Fulham, Hull City and Brighton and Hove Albion, took charge of Strasbourg in July 2024 after coaching spells at Derby County and Hull in Englands second tier. While he is relatively inexperienced as a top-level coach, his reputation has grown after leading Strasbourg to European qualification following a seventh-placed finish in Ligue 1. My job is to protect that identity and create a team that reflects these values in every game we play as we continue winning trophies, he said. To be entrusted with this role means the world to me and I want to thank all involved for the opportunity and faith in undertaking this job. Rosenior became the leading candidate to replace Maresca, thanks in large part to the fact that Strasbourg and Chelsea are part of the same multi-club ownership structure, with the French club taken over by Boehlys consortium BlueCo in 2023. His immediate task will be to turn around Chelseas form after a run of only one win in eight Premier League games and his first game in charge is likely to be a London derby away at Fulham on Wednesday. Chelsea were third in the standings in November and being tipped as title contenders but have since slipped to fifth and are 17 points behind leaders Arsenal after 20 matches. Maresca led Chelsea back into the Champions League and won the FIFA Club World Cup last year but his relationship with the club became increasingly acrimonious. Rosenior will be tasked with steadying the ship and getting the most out of an expensively-assembled squad full of international household names, a contrast to his time at Strasbourg where he worked with an unsung squad. I am excited to work with this extremely talented group of players and staff, to build strong connections on and off the pitch, and to create an environment where everyone feels united and driven by the same goal, he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Rosenior had used a press conference at Strasbourg to announce he had agreed to move to Chelsea, saying his assistants Kalifa Cisse and Justin Walker would join him. The last 18 months have been a joy and the best of my professional career, Rosenior said.

Eruption rumbles on training track,"Jan 06, 2026, 07:16 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 07:16 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fe3fb6cb9c6726fc5cc6e86ef254e3ea9e093213bec79d8dc5ae777524d329b4,"Eruption (Blaike McDougall) finishing off strongly to claim the Class 4A race (1,400m) at Sungai Besi on Jan 26, 2025. The Simon Dunderdale trained-gelding galloped well on Jan 6 ahead of his Supreme B (1,500m) contest on Jan 11.PHOTO: SLTC","['Horse racing', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Sports and recreation']","By his lofty standards, it was an okay sort of opener to the 2026 racing season. Trainer Simon Dunderdale pulled off a win and a second from 12 runners at Selangors 11-race meeting on Jan 3. With a team of 14 – including one emergency acceptor – entered for the meeting on Jan 11, it could be wise to follow the man who finished second on the 2025 Malaysian trainers log on 64 winners. On the morning of Jan 6 and on a track rated good – as opposed to the soggy conditions the day before – the 2024 Malaysian champion trainers Eruption showed good action in his preparatory workout at Sungai Besi. Not out to break any records, he cleared the 600m in 41sec. It was a no-frills training, but still a meaningful gallop. A five-year-old by Xtravagant, Eruption has been one of the stars from the Buffalo Stable. His record of six wins – of which two were at Kranji when he was under the care of Tim Fitzsimmons – from 24 starts speaks volumes of his ability and we know that he is not done yet. There are more wins in that tight and taut frame of his and, come Jan 11, he could have the Supreme B race (1,500m) at his mercy. Having won his last two races with metronome precision, Eruption is gunning for a hat-trick of victories. And there is little to suggest that he cannot get the job done. But standing in his way is another galloper who matched Eruptions good work on the training track. He is Fortune Tree, and he is one of trainer Richard Lims racers who, on past showings and current form, should have a rewarding 2026 season. Sent out for his morning gallop and partnered by Shafiq Rizuan, Fortune Tree disposed of the 600m in an easy 38sec. It was a gallop full of enterprise and resolution and, as one of four last-start winners in the line-up, the son of Ardrossan could be the one who spoils Dunderdales party. A four-year-old New Zealand-bred, Fortune Tree will be right at home over the 1,500m trip. After his winning debut in a 1,275m Maiden race on Aug 9, he took out two more Class 3 races over the 1,200m and 1,300m, before his fourth and latest victory at his last start on Dec 21. It was a Supreme A race over 1,400m and, ridden by Shafiq Rizuan, he came off second spot at the furlong mark to win going away. His work does seem to suggest that he is holding that winning form. Elsewhere on the 12-race programme, the Bankers Stable could be looking at a profitable afternoon. Represented by runners in nine of the 12 races, they were out in force on the training track where two – in particular – drew attention to their chances. In separate gallops, the Johnny Lim Boon Thong-trained Bankers Hero showed good action when running the 600m in 38.6sec while his stablemate, Bankers Strong, was raring to go but was hard held to run out the trip in a flashy 36.7sec. Down to contest the Class 4A race over the middle distance of 1,600m, Bankers Hero had an inauspicious debut, finishing ninth in that Supreme C race won by Eruption on Dec 21. In his defence, the son of Toronado raced wide for most of the 1,500m trip. The four-year-old gelding is better than that. Previously known as Call Up King in Australia, he was, on June 2, a winner over the mile. As for Bankers Strong, he has been steadily working towards a winning show. The Pride Of Dubai four-year-old galloper will be having his fifth start in the Class 4B race (1,600m), and he looms as a lively outsider. To date and at his Selangor Turf Club home base, Bankers Strong made the board behind runaway winner Elite Prince in a Class 4A sprint (1,200m) on Nov 30. He will be better suited to the 1,600m he has to cover on Jan 11. Like Bankers Hero, he too was a winner in Australia when, known as Gulfstate, he took out a 1,450m race at Kilmore in Victoria on Feb 21. Lim has picked a winnable sort of race for the bay entire who, on training form, could beef up those novelty bets. brian@sph.com.sg",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/eruption-rumbles-on-training-track

Speaking to Reuters one month before the start of the February 6-22 Games, Eliasch said recent cold temperatures had helped organisers address earlier concerns over snow farming and snow making at key sites including Cortina dAmpezzo, Livigno, Bormio and Val di Fiemme. Yes, it has, Eliasch said when asked whether his confidence had grown. The preparations are advancing very well. Weve had cold temperatures, which helps. And right now, it looks like there should be no issue to complete everything on time as planned. So thats very good news. Italian authorities and organisers have faced mounting scrutiny over delays, funding gaps and climate-related risks ahead of the Games, particularly after a warm start to the winter raised doubts about snow reliability. Eliasch said snow security remained partly dependent on weather conditions but stressed that organisers had the technical capacity and resources in place to manage risks. We are in the hands of the gods but you also need the resources for snow making, and the capabilities that are necessary here are in place, Eliasch said. So from that perspective... its all looking good. He added that contingency planning was standard practice at major events, with reserve days built into competition schedules to deal with heavy snowfall or adverse weather that could disrupt races. That happens all the time, Eliasch said. I mean, were very used to that. It happens during the world championships. Sometimes it happens also during the Olympic Games. And at this point, we have reserve days for the schedule so that if there are weather issues, we can delay the race. Eliasch also reiterated his view that future Winter Games hosting should prioritise snow-secure venues at higher altitudes and rely on a limited rotation of established locations to reduce costs and improve sustainability. What is clear here is that snow security is very much tied to the altitude of the venues, he said. But snow security is only one part of that equation. Its also about maintaining the venues, and that requires continuous competitions. Make sure that we do World Cups in these venues every year, and that will incentivize the local organisers to keep their committees together, Eliasch added. So we have the local competence and also to invest in the venues, the courses, whatever it takes. And thats far more efficient than trying to reinvent the wheel in new destinations. He said a realistic long-term model for the World Cup could involve maybe realistically three, four, or five venues in continental Europe… maybe a couple in Scandinavia, maybe one or two in North America, and two or three in Asia. Asked whether any major issues remained unresolved ahead of the Games, Eliasch said: Well, that remains to be seen. Hopefully not. Were making good progress, but well find out. No doubt. Pressed on what mattered most at this stage, he added: So far, the most critical issues are all on schedule and that is what matters.

Lion City Sailors new winger Luka Adzic unfazed by Maxime Lestienne comparison,"Jan 06, 2026, 06:23 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 06:26 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f3887ccc164b4de1360c14c959b40ee3f2700fc47558c80be573db023b0b2add,Serbian winger Luka Adzic hopes to make an instant impact in the Singapore Cup final on his Lion City Sailors debut after joining from Bangkok United.PHOTO: LION CITY SAILORS,"['Singapore Premier League', 'Singapore football', 'Lion City Sailors']","SINGAPORE – There are arguably few things more difficult for a footballer than trying to fill the void left by a club legend. Starting this week, Serbian winger Luka Adzic will attempt to prove he has the goals and assists to be a worthy replacement for Belgian star Maxime Lestienne, who left the club in December. Making it an even more challenging scenario, the 27-year-old is likely to make his Lion City Sailors debut in the Singapore Cup final against BG Tampines Rovers at the Jalan Besar Stadium on Jan 10. But he remains unfazed, saying: I dont think were the same type of players, but I dont feel the pressure. Maxime is an excellent player. I know him from Belgium, he left a big mark in this club, and Im sorry I didnt have the opportunity to play together with him. Yes, my first game will be the final, but I dont feel the pressure. I just arrived, and I will do my best to help the team win this game because I would like my first game to be marked by winning the Cup. As time goes by, I will be the best version of myself. An attacker who is adept at playing on the left or being the playmaker, Adzic arrives from Bangkok United, whom he helped to a runners-up finish in last seasons Thai League 1, just one point behind champions Buriram United. Born in Belgrade, he joined local side Red Star at age six and rose through the ranks to win the Serbian SuperLiga in 2018. Thereafter, he had stints in Belgium (Anderlecht), the Netherlands (FC Emmen and PEC Zwolle), Turkey (Ankaragucu) and returned to Serbia to play for Cukaricki from 2022 to 2024 before moving to Thailand. With Lestiennes impressive tally of 70 goals and 97 assists in 131 games helping the Sailors to one Singapore Premier League title, two Singapore Cup triumphs and an AFC Champions League Two (ACL2) final appearance, any attacker tasked to replace the Belgian will inevitably be held to scrutiny. While Adzics tally of six goals and three assists in 43 games for Bangkok pales in comparison, he had left an impression on the Sailors in an ACL2 group game last November. He scored the winner in a 2-1 victory at the Bishan Stadium which eventually sealed the Thai teams progress to the knockout stage at the expense of the Singapore side. Sailors coach Aleksandar Rankovic said: Luka is a player who gives us something different in wide areas – he is very strong in one-on-one situations, sharp in tight spaces, and capable of both scoring and creating goals. His playing style fits our philosophy perfectly, and Im confident he will excel here. It is believed that the Sailors had shown interest to sign Adzic two years ago, and now that they have got their man on a contract till the end of the season, it is hoped that he can be as successful as his former Bangkok teammate Richairo Zivkovic, who grabbed 15 goals and three assists in 19 games for the Sailors in 2023. Adzic said: Two years ago, I didnt know much about the (Sailors) and Asian football. But when I came to Asia, Richairo told me a lot of good things about the club, and that helped me a lot to make a quick decision. I have played against the Sailors two times this season and I know the players, which is very important at the beginning. Yes, I scored against the Sailors, but now Im very happy to have a chance to fight for titles because this is the best club in Singapore, and I hope we will win everything we can at the end of the season. Adzic may not be the only player the Sailors will recruit from Bangkok United. The Straits Times understands they could swoop in for playmaker Kyoga Nakamura as the Thai club had announced mutual termination of the Japan-born Singapore internationals contract. The 29-year-old had expressed his wishes to return to the Republic for personal reasons after making 17 appearances for them.",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/lion-city-sailors-new-winger-luka-adzic-unfazed-by-maxime-lestienne-comparison

Sabalenka, who was beaten in straight sets by Kyrgios a week ago in a Dubai exhibition, resumed her preparations for the Australian Open by turning on the style to beat Cristina Bucsa 6-0 6-1 in 47 minutes to reach the third round. Definitely my serve worked really well, she said after the quickest victory of her career. I did a couple of serve-and-volleys, which is like, wow, so yeah, Im super happy with the level. Im happy to be back. I always enjoy playing in front of all you guys. That was a great performance from me. The defending Brisbane champion faces either Sorana Cirstea or Jelena Ostapenko next as she looks to build momentum for the January 18 to February 1 Grand Slam at Melbourne Park, where she will be hunting a third title. The injury-plagued Kyrgios also had a short spell on court in his first singles match since March, the Australian losing 6-3 6-4 to American Aleksandar Kovacevic in 65 minutes. The 30-year-old is hoping for a wildcard at Melbourne Park and will try to build his match fitness when he teams up with Thanasi Kokkinakis for a doubles round of 16 match on Wednesday. The duo won their match against Matthew Ebden and Rajeev Ram on Sunday and will take on Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul next. Despite doubts about his future in the sport, Kyrgios said that Tuesdays match was part of the rebuilding process after a series of wrist and knee injuries derailed his career following his run to the 2022 Wimbledon final. This is a stepping stone, Kyrgios added. I actually just spoke to Daniil Medvedev in the locker room, and hes like, look, you play one match every now and then, its not going to be the way you want it all the time. As long as I feel good and Im going to be able to try and use it as a building block, thats my goal obviously, and not just Australian Open but this year, for whatever this year holds, I do want to continue to play as much as I can.

Although the shorter trip is the query, the set-up looks ideal. 3 Storm Runnerkeeps doing plenty right without breaking through, posting four placings from five runs this season to take his record to seven placings from 15 starts, albeit still no win. Eventually, everything will fall into place for him to land a blow. 7 Beauty Missilehas not disgraced himself since the switch to the Brett Crawford stable. He can get a kinder run, which lifts his chances on a third look at Class 5. 5 Super Sicariois up against it from the wide draw, but, if he lands in a conducive spot, he is not without a chance on his third run in the cellar grade. 3 Run Run Smartcan find the top easily from barrier 1 under Zac Purton and make his own luck. Those tactics worked three runs back and he was collared only late for third last time when trying the same again. He looks hard to run down. 6 Loving Vibesshould not be far off the speed either from barrier 2. His two runs in blinkers since they went on have hinted another win is not far away. 7 Lakeshore Heroscored two starts ago. Then he had the widest stall to overcome, was eased back to find cover and still closed strongly late for fifth last time. 9 Amazing Kidcomes off his first win at the eighth attempt. With the penny seeming to have dropped, he can go on with it, especially with barrier 4 providing another good map set-up. 12 Ace Warkeeps threatening a win, three placings from five for the term, all over this track and trip. He is close and, with Purton now in the saddle, he is ready to strike. 2 The Azureis due some luck and, if things fall into place, he looks ready to win. He was last seen six lengths away in ninth, but a mid-race check and being badly held up late never gave him a true shot. 4 Prestige Rickyalso comes through a luckless run. He settled well back from barrier 12 before finishing held up over the concluding stages, which has been the tale of his last three. 10 Golden Brilliantis a bit of a throw at the stumps, unplaced in five starts and largely unwanted in the betting. However, his last start was a big improvement when wearing blinkers for the first time, and Caspar Fownes stepping him up in trip looks a fair move. 10 Crystal Powerfulgets the obvious boost of barrier 1, which should allow him to park in the right spot after working in overdrive from barrier 11 last time. He has yet to feature in four runs this term, yet this looks his best set-up so far. 7 Ace Powercomes into this off a fast-finishing third after stepping away from barrier 10, so he should enjoy the kinder draw, as well as having Purton in the saddle. 1 Fatal Blowhas again drawn barrier 10, after striking it in both runs since returning to Class 4 and he has not been beaten far despite tough trips. The map once again looks tricky, but he is capable. 2 Fortune Whiskeybounced back to form when returning to his preferred track and trip last time. He can run to his rating again, which he tends to do. 10 Quick Contributionhad a poor trip last start, yet still checked in fourth. That effort was better than it reads at face value and, after being costly at the head of the market in his last two, he still warrants another chance. 5 Bull Attitudereturns to Happy Valley off a closing eighth over 1,400m at Sha Tin and the rise in trip is a plus. He went down a neck in second three runs ago, before tactics went awry next time when ridden too close to the speed. 9 Superb Guygets the gun run from barrier 1 in a race that does not look to have much speed. This gives him an edge and a chance to build on an encouraging last-start third. 2 Nearly Finecan bounce back at any time in this grade, and the return to 1,650m may be what he has been looking for. 8 Straight To Glorylooks well suited on his first look at Happy Valley, arriving off a series of good runs in stronger Sha Tin races. Those placings behind Bulb General and Robot Lucky Star are formlines worth noting. 2 Flying Wroteis the in-form runner, a win and two seconds from three runs this season, and his map looks ideal from barrier 4. 3 Tactical Commanddraws nicely in barrier 2 on his second look back in Class 4, the same gate he won from five runs ago. A similar set-up gives him every chance. 4 Victor The Rapidcan strike at any time in this class, as shown two runs back when third on the return, while last time, he was simply too far back after a wide draw. A kinder barrier and an in-form Maxime Guyon staying aboard add to his cause. 9 Love Togetheris better than his last-start sixth. He was wiped out at the start and never got into the race early, before a late surge and beaten only three lengths. He gets another look, especially from barrier 2. 2 Horsepoweris better suited back at Happy Valley after two Sha Tin runs that did not play to his strengths. He is quirky, but the track and trip are ideal and Purton back on is a tick. 5 Eternal Fortunehad plenty go wrong last time, covering extra ground and still sticking on for fifth. A cleaner run from barrier 3 can see him right in the finish. 1 Harmony N Blessedhas been flat in stronger races. But this is a softer set-up and he has the right form for it, having beaten Eternal Fortune the last time he was in this grade. 10 Perfect Generaldid not disgrace himself at his first try in Class 3. He drew wide, settled quieter than in his previous win, before closing strongly in fourth. Barrier 2 is the map upgrade that can put him right on the doorstep. 12 My Day My Wayresumed off a lengthy layoff from barrier 12 and the rider kept him out of trouble, but he rattled home in eighth and that finish did not go unnoticed. He has since trialled well. 9 Refusetobeenglishhas improved across four runs this season and his last-start ninth was better than it looks, after he never saw daylight at a key stage late. Barrier 1 gives him every chance and lift. 2 Spicy Goldrarely runs a bad race, and he keeps finding the line strongly. He is a safe inclusion in a race like this for multiples. 3 King Lotuscomes off back-to-back seconds in two tries at this trip since stepping up from 1,200m. He did plenty of work from a wide gate last time, beaten under a length, and barrier 6 this time ensures he has less early work to do. 7 Corleoneputs his unbeaten record for the season on the line rising in class, which he should handle if he keeps trending the right way. He gets the right sort of run from barrier 4 to measure up. 2 Loch Taysurprised at big odds second-up and, while he did not back it up last time, he clipped heels in the run and also raced too wide. A quiet trial between runs reads well and he can improve. 9 Romantic Laoshas not had much going his way this season.

Chelsea announce appointment of Liam Rosenior as new manager,"Jan 06, 2026, 04:45 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 06:53 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/642e9fff8524a7582aa1e316a55b05b7ce2385e533e3c3606e86cefda8f4ebfb,"Strasbourg coach Liam Rosenior ahead of the 1-1 French Ligue 1 football draw against Nice at the Allianz Riviera Stadium in France, on Jan 3.PHOTO: AFP","['EPL', 'Chelsea', 'Football matches']","PARIS – English Premier League giants Chelsea on Jan 6 announced the appointment of Strasbourg boss Liam Rosenior as their new manager to replace Enzo Maresca. The Englishman, who has signed a contract until 2032, said in a club statement that he was extremely humbled and honoured to be appointed. This is a club with a unique spirit and a proud history of winning trophies, he added. My job is to protect that identity and create a team that reflects these values in every game we play as we continue winning trophies. Rosenior had said at a press conference earlier on Jan 6 that it looks like I am going to be the next manager of Chelsea, adding it was an opportunity I cannot turn down. He said then: I was given permission to speak to one of the biggest sporting clubs in the world... I havent signed yet, I have agreed verbally with Chelsea. Its really important, this is different to anything anyone has ever done – nobody has made a statement before they have signed a contract. Everything is agreed and it will probably go through in the next few hours. Im here because I care about this club and I felt it was right to answer your questions physically here today before I move on. The Blues had been looking for a replacement aftersacking former manager Marescaon New Years Day. They were unhappy with reports that Maresca had spoken to Manchester City about possibly succeeding Pep Guardiola at the end of the season, amid suggestions that he had tried to use a potential move as a bargaining tool in negotiations over an extended contract. There had also been a dispute over the extent of Marescas authority to ignore the advice of medical staff when bringing players back into the team after injury. Rosenior, however, will be expected to work under similar conditions, with issues such as player recruitment largely the responsibility of the clubs five-strong team of sporting directors. Rosenior, 41, had travelled to London to meet with Chelseas clubs sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart on Jan 5. Strasbourg are owned by Chelseas parent company BlueCo, a consortium headed by US billionaire businessman Todd Boehly. A club source said Strasbourg are already working behind the scenes to find his replacement... as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the training session on Jan 5 was overseeen by Roseniors assistants Jean-Marc Kuentz and Filipe Coelho. The Englishman previously managed Hull City before joining Strasbourg in July 2024. He led the French club to a seventh-place finish in Ligue 1 last season. Chelsea – fifth in the Premier League and three points off the Champions League places – have assembled a large squad of young players with limited top-level experience, with Maresca seemingly unhappy with the amount of squad rotation his side endured. Rosenior has enjoyed a measure of success with a similarly young squad at Strasbourg, and led them into the knockout rounds of the Europa Conference League. While he may never have managed in the Premier League, he comes with a glowing reference from former Manchester United and England great Wayne Rooney. After a short spell in charge of Brighton & Hove Albions Under-23s, Rosenior began his senior coaching career in 2019 at Derby County, first under Philiip Cocu and then as assistant to Rooney. Hes taken chances, and hopefully that pays off because I think Liam is as good a coach as Ive ever worked with, Rooney said on his BBC podcast. He was incredible in his coaching ability, added Rooney, highlighting Roseniors attention to detail. The 41-year-old briefly replaced Rooney on an interim basis in 2022 and later that year took over as manager of Hull City in the Championship.

The Hawks and Young have remained in contact about his future with the organisation since Atlanta elected not to offer him a contract extension last off-season when he became eligible, according to ESPN. ESPN also reported those talks have escalated over the last week. Marc Stein of The Stein Line reported on Jan 5 that the Washington Wizards had emerged as a legitimate potential trade destination for Young. Young, 27, has spent his entire career in Atlanta since the Hawks acquired him in a draft-and-trade deal with Dallas in the 2018 NBA Draft as the fifth overall pick. He is the franchises all-time leader in assists (4,837) and three-pointers made (1,295). His career average of 9.8 assists per game is the third-highest in NBA history, behind only Magic Johnson and John Stockton. Young, a third-team All-NBA player for the 2021-22 season, led the Hawks to the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2020-21 campaign. Atlanta failed to make it out of the first round the next two seasons and also could not escape the play-in tournament the last two campaigns. Young has missed 28 of Atlantas 38 games this season, and he is currently sidelined by a quad contusion. Young is averaging 19.3 points and 8.9 assists per game – both the lowest since his rookie season – in his limited action this campaign. The Hawks are 2-8 with Young this season and 15-13 in his absence after the Jan 5 118-100 loss at the Toronto Raptors. Jalen Johnsons emergence (career highs of 24 points, 10.2 rebounds and 8.5 assists this season) in his fifth campaign has filled the scoring void with Young sidelined. Over eight seasons and 493 games (all starts), Young has averaged 25.2 points, 3.5 rebounds and one steal per contest. In on-court action on Jan 5, Brandon Miller scored 28 points to help lift the Charlotte Hornets to a 124-97 road victory over the NBA-best Oklahoma City Thunder. The win was the Hornets first over the Thunder since March 2023 and the first for any Eastern Conference opponent in Oklahoma City in a regular-season matchup since March 2024. The Thunder had not lost to an Eastern Conference team anywhere since Jan 8 at the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Thunder hadnt scored fewer than 101 points in any game this season, nor had they lost a game by more than 20 points before Mondays blowout. In Detroit, Cade Cunningham scored 29 points and handed out 13 assists to propel the Pistons to a 121-90 victory over the Knicks in a duel of the top two teams in the Eastern Conference. The Boston Celtics – who overtook the Knicks for second spot in the conference with a 115-101 victory over the Chicago Bulls.
