Bento meals for Hwa Chong students prepared by Sats draw criticism online,"Jan 07, 2026, 12:00 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 12:13 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/2c3ddc3571629991d8f2b3b63fde8551f60a777ec8a8a7d6edf09edaba9607e4,Comments left on the post on social media platform Reddit likened the bento meals to prison food and cook house meals.PHOTOS: HWA CHONG INSTITUTION,"['Hwa Chong Institution', 'Education and schools', 'Food Trending']","SINGAPORE - Photos of student mealsprovided by airline caterer Satsfor Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) students on the first day of school have sparked criticism, after images of the bento sets were posted online on Jan 3. Comments left on the post on social media platform Reddit likened the bento meals to prison food and cook house meals. In response to queries, Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) said it is aware of the concerns raised about its new canteen model. It said that the photograph circulating online does not accurately reflect the typical food offerings or portion standards provided. The school has since January 2 worked with Sats to run its high school and college canteens under a hybrid model that combines freshly cooked meals from on-site stalls with pre-packed options prepared in a central kitchen. Under the new system, the institutions 4,300 students and staff can pre-order bento sets through an app, as well as buy meals and desserts from stalls on campus offering options such as Indian fusion, Chinese cuisine and soft-serve yogurt. This was in response to feedback from students about long recess queues, and to address the challenge faced in 2025 by the high schools nine food stalls and one drink stall to keep prices affordable amid rising prices of ingredients as they operate independently. In view of sector-wide manpower constraints affecting school canteen operations, the hybrid model allows us to ensure students continue to have access to balanced, reasonably priced meals that meet their nutritional needs and dietary preferences, said a HCI spokeswoman. Students may pre-order bento meals - designed by Sats certified nutritionists. There are at least three regular options daily, priced at $3.60 each, or premium options priced at $4.80 each. HCI said the menu will be rotated regularly, and students will also have access to live stalls for additional variety and choice. Before making the switch, HCI consulted students, staff and parents through assemblies, meetings and food-tasting sessions. Sats conducted a large food-tasting event in October 2024 for about 200 participants – students, teachers and parents – from both the high school and college. The school also invited representatives from the Parent Support Groups and the High School Students Council on Jan 5 to sample the food and review the bento menus. Feedback indicated that portions were sufficient, food was served warm, and prices were reasonable. Participants also welcomed the lighter seasoning in the meals, as well as the regular menu rotation and availability of live food stalls, said HCI. Apart from closely monitoring its canteen operations - including food quality, portion sizes and students dining experiences - the school is in the process of establishing a canteen review committee . It will comprise staff, student and parent representatives, working in partnership with SATS. The committee will meet regularly to review key aspects of the canteen operations and provide feedback for ongoing improvements. Its spokeswoman said: HCI remains committed to ensuring our canteen meets students needs and encourages parents and students to share their feedback directly with the school and SATS, so that we can consider the feedback as we continue to refine our new canteen model. Sats has also been catering to Yusof Ishak Secondary School since 2022, a pilot which the Education Ministry said led to the expansion of the central kitchen model to more schools in 2026.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bento-meals-for-hwa-chong-students-prepared-by-sats-draw-criticism-online

Singapore birdwatchers abuzz over Himalayan vultures spotted in Clementi,"Jan 07, 2026, 11:30 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 12:03 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/731831868ab78eaec088906d38e9fd6ac4bba90e438d8ab3f6e5608204830cd2,The Himalayan vultures were spotted at Maju Forest on Jan 4 and 5.PHOTO: KELVIN NG CHENG KWAN/FACEBOOK,"['Birds', 'Clementi', 'Animals']","SINGAPORE - Mass sightings of Himalayan vultures – a species typically found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas – have sparked a buzz among Singapores birding community in recent days. Known for their long, broad wings and whitish streaks on their brownish mantle and scapulars, the vultures were spotted at Maju Forest on Jan 4 and 5. The species is currently classified as near threatened by BirdLife International, a global partnership of non-governmental organisations dedicated to bird conservation. Updates about the sightings quickly flooded social media platforms such as Facebook, with bird enthusiasts across the island sharing photographs, videos and real-time information. Mr Kelvin Ng, 51, first heard about the vultures being seen in the trees of Maju Forest on the evening of Jan 4. He decided to head to Clementi Street 13, the nearest vantage point, the following morning. When he arrived, he saw about 30 to 40 birdwatchers gathered on the 14th floor of Block 118 Clementi Street 13, snapping photographs of four vultures. Mr Ng, a production supervisor, said: Although its not my first time seeing them here, it is always an exciting experience to see these huge raptors. It is rare to see them in Singapore as they are vagrant birds. Singapore has no food source for them, so it is very rare for them to perch here to rest. Bird enthusiast Anderson Ng also learnt about the vultures appearance through a WhatsApp chat group. The 62-year-old semi-retiree went to Mount Faber on Jan 4 to wait for the birds, but they did not appear. Undeterred, he went to Clementi Street 13 at 7am on Jan 5 and waited for two hours till they finally appeared. Its a magnificent bird to see, Mr Ng said. Its wingspan stretches over 3m in flight. I was elated to get a picture of it this year. Another birdwatcher, Mr Hong Yijun, described seeing the vultures in person as majestic. The 31-year-old engineer had previously seen Himalayan vultures at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 2021. I have seen many rare birds, but seeing the vultures always amazes me as they are such large sentient creatures and have flown here from a long distance, he said. However, Mr Hong added that he hopes the vultures will leave Singapore soon, as the birds typically feed on animal carcasses, which are absent here. Himalayan vultures have a wingspan of between 2.5m and 3m, and can weigh up to 12kg, captivating birdwatchers with their sheer size. Dr Movin Nyanasengeran, president of Bird Society of Singapore, said the vultures appearance over the past week is part of their post-breeding dispersal period, when juvenile birds become independent and leave their parents territory. Young birds tend to wander more than adults, and these vultures were probably lost during their dispersal, he said, adding that Singapore typically records such sightings every two to three years around the start of the year. Dr Yong Ding Li, head of flyways and species conservation for BirdLife International in Asia, said the vultures main geographical range spans the Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, Central Asia and Mongolia. He added that young birds scatter farther to search for food in the form of animal carcasses during post-breeding dispersal in winter, and when food becomes much scarcer. Most Himalayan vultures in South-east Asia are found in Thailand and Myanmar, with a small number occasionally reaching Singapore, which lies at the edge of their regular distribution range. According to Bird Society of Singapore records, the vultures were last seen in Strathmore Avenue in February 2025. The earliest local record dates back to December 1989, when four vultures were spotted in Tuas.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-birdwatchers-abuzz-with-himalayan-vultures-spotted-in-clementi

In a statement on Jan 6, the New Zealand Customs Service said that the alleged drug courier, a 33-year-old New Zealand national, had arrived at Auckland Airport from Singapore on Jan 4 and was referred to Customs for further questioning. During a search of her baggage, Customs officers found 18 individually vacuum-sealed packages containing a white crystalline substance.

Playing mahjong to build intergenerational ties,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/03f5c6c97a7b85e2a8ce79e264c68193aa49c0944f29640a49c11a1c8c9c288e,Mahjong Together brings together players young and old over games of mahjong.ST PHOTO: LIU YING,"['TL;DR', 'Volunteering', 'Community centres and clubs']","SINGAPORE – Every Tuesday, elderly residents in Toa Payoh rush to register to ballot for a weekly mahjong session held on Sunday afternoons at their local community club. These sessions – where 24 youth volunteers mingle with 24 elderly residents over mahjong – are so well-received by seniors that they are frequently oversubscribed, and balloting had to be introduced in 2025 to give more people a chance to attend. Im very happy when I get the chance to play, said retiree Kong Yoke Kew, 73, who has been attending the sessions at Toa Payoh West Community Club for two years. I look forward to it every week. These sessions are led by a group of young people who hope to bridge the intergenerational gap through a game that elderly residents can play. Called Mahjong Together, the group was started by students from Dunman High School in 2021. The initiative is now run by a committee of 15 young people that rotates yearly, mostly students, who handle its operations, outreach and recruitment. Youth volunteers for each months sessions are recruited monthly via online-sign ups, with about 70 to 90 volunteers turning up each month to play games at community clubs, active ageing centres and care homes across Singapore. Sessions are mostly organised on an ad-hoc basis, but they run most regularly on Sunday afternoons at Toa Payoh West Community Club. Ms Yap Yihui, a Dunman High School alumnus who is currently a University of Virginia undergraduate, was part of the founding batch of four students who independently initiated the project, as they wanted to do more for their community. The 21-year-old said news stories highlighting loneliness among the elderly during the Covid-19 pandemic spurred her to start the group. Of picking mahjong as the conduit, Ms Yap said: The most important aspect of mahjong is the way it is set up – four people together at a table, half talking and laughing about the game, half catching up about life. This makes it possible for natural conversation to flow. Ms Yap has stepped down from the initiative since going abroad for university, but said the growth of the project has been surreal to witness. She added: I would never have guessed that the project we did in 2021 would have reached this stage, and I am so, so happy with how everything turned out. At a recent session in December 2025, the sound of friendly chatter and mahjong tiles shuffling on tables filled the room as seniors and young people played. First-time volunteer and Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) student Duan Zehao, 16, said that he had a good time playing with the seniors. He said: It was very fun. I even managed to learn some mahjong tips from the seniors I played with.No money changes hands during Mahjong Together sessions, which last three hours each. For some volunteers, their love for mahjong is what initially drew them to join the initiative. I started volunteering in January 2024 with my mahjong kakis after hearing about it in school, said Dunman High School student Harris Lau, 17. I grew up with mahjong and I love to socialize so it was perfect for me. Knowing how to play mahjong is preferred but not necessary for taking part in the initiative. Dunman High School student Reese Chin, 17, was introduced to the initiative by a senior and learnt to play mahjong from other volunteers when she joined the group in January 2025. The Mahjong Together committee member said: I picked the game up quite quickly, but some of the aunties will still jokingly scold me when I play too slowly or make the wrong move. Other youth volunteers said the sense of community kept them coming back to volunteer. Dunman High alumnus Tan Yan Kai, who is currently waiting to enlist in national service, was a committee member in 2024. The 18-year-old returned for his first session in 10 months in December 2025, after taking time off to focus on his A-levels. I was very touched that many of the aunties and uncles still recognised me and asked how Id been, he said. I really missed the atmosphere. I think its very heartwarming for us to give back. Seniors who participate also felt they benefited from and enjoyed the sessions. Ms Doris Tan, 66, a homemaker, said: Its a good way for me to pass the time and it keeps my mind active. I enjoy playing mahjong with young people because I can learn from them, and they can learn from me.Madam Kong said in Mandarin: Its very fun to meet and play with these familiar faces. Playing with these young people also makes me younger.

Half of The Centrepoint up for collective sale at $418m guide price,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 11:54 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/565378532330feac516b6ac5d7b35753d4b92c77e56d307033dde1e7dc9e6c8b,Only the leasehold portion of The Centrepoint in Orchard Road is being offered in this maiden push for a collective sale.PHOTO: SAVILLS SINGAPORE,"['En bloc/collective sale', 'Malls', 'Singapore property']","SINGAPORE – About half of The Centrepoint, the grand dame of Orchard Road in the 1980s, has been put up for collective sale for the first time at a guide price of $418 million on Jan 7. Developed by Frasers Centrepoint (now Frasers Property) and opened in May 1983, the seven-storey Centrepoint includes a residential complex with 66 units. It comprises Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) plan numbers 1304 and 1298, and straddles two adjoining plots. But only the leasehold portion of the property at 176A Orchard Road – comprising the rear of the mall where 66 strata retail units and residential floors are located under MCST Plan No. 1304 – is being offered in this maiden attempt at a collective sale. The remaining 151 retail units under MCST Plan No. 1298 are not part of this collective sale tender, marketing agent Savills Singapore said. Mr Jeremy Lake, managing director of investment sales and capital markets at Savills Singapore, said: As the shops and apartment sizes vary significantly, we estimate that each owner or retail tenant will get about 30 per cent above their current open market value. Under the latest URA masterplan, the site is zoned for commercial use with a plot ratio of 5.6 and a maximum height of 10 storeys, allowing for redevelopment into a new mixed-use development. Located in Singapores iconic shopping belt, the property has about 52 years left on its 99-year leasehold tenure, and a site area of about 44,700 sq ft. The $418 million guide price translates to a land rate of $2,709 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr). This is after factoring in a land betterment charge of $260 million for topping up the lease to a fresh 99 years and intensifying the total gross floor area to a plot ratio of 5.6. Only MCST Plan No. 1304, which can be independently redeveloped, received 80 per cent consensus from its unit owners for the development, Mr Lake said. Nothing is happening at MCST 1298 and there are no plans for a sale, he added. According to the Singapore Land Authority, the property has a verified development baseline of approximately 171,482 sq ft, equivalent to a plot ratio of 3.83, and a maximum allowable gross floor area of about 250,320 sq ft. Mr Lake added: Developers have been bidding aggressively for Government Land Sales sites, and some of them will be keen to buy a part of The Centrepoint. For this reason, we are confident we can exceed the guide price of $418 million... With its direct link to Somerset MRT station, excellent accessibility, and location in the heart of Orchard Road, the property offers developers a chance to develop a landmark property with an internationally recognised address. Savills has brokered several major collective sales in Orchard Road, including Concorde Hotel & Shopping Mall at $821 million, or $1,804 psf ppr; Delfi Orchard at $439 million, or $3,346 psf ppr; Tanglin Shopping Centre at $868 million, or $2,769 psf ppr; and Ming Arcade at $172 million or $3,125 psf ppr. There are no restrictions on foreign ownership.

This is why Cycle & Carriage is investing over $50 million to refurbish its facilities across its entire network in Singapore, a process that began in 2023 and will continue to 2027. This transformation will be seen in showrooms, service centres and infrastructure with three clear design priorities: hospitality, efficiency and sustainability. Mr Wilfrid Foo, managing director of Cycle & Carriage, says customers in Singapore now expect more than just a vehicle purchase. They expect a seamless, sustainable and digitally-enabled experience end-to-end. Our transformation agenda brings together a diversified brand portfolio, elevated facilities and a clear sustainability road map to meet these expectations, he explains. On the hospitality front, Cycle & Carriage points to lounges with clear sightlines to vehicles. There are also cafe-style engagement zones, offering customers a relaxed and comfortable space to browse catalogues or have discussions with their sales representatives. At the Mercedes-Benz Center, for example, customers can enjoy phygital consultation spaces in semi-private or private settings. This allows customers to explore the physical vehicle while accessing a range of digital customisation options, together with Mercedes-Benz sales consultants providing personalised guidance and expertise. Various upgrades will be progressively rolled out across all of Cycle & Carriages locations, including the Mercedes-Benz Center, the Multi-Brand Complex at 239 Alexandra Road, the Eunos Service Centre, Pandan Loop Service Centre and Pandan Gardens Complex. Over at the Eunos Service Centre, there will be new customer lounges, modernised service bays and streamlined vehicle drop-off and collection, to enhance the overall customer experience and journey. As part of its evolution, Cycle & Carriage plans to progressively achieve Green Mark certification for four of its largest facilities: the Mercedes-Benz Center, Eunos Service Centre, 239 Alexandra Road and Pandan Loop Service Centre by end-2027. In a significant enhancement, 2,252 rooftop solar panels across 6,700 sq m have been installed at Cycle & Carriages Pandan Loop Service Centre. The solar panels will also be installed in the Mercedes-Benz Center later this year. The aim? Generating truly sustainable power and reducing operational carbon footprint. To accelerate its electric vehicle (EV) presence, four new EV DC chargers have been added for owners of Mercedes-Benz cars. For an EV-curious customer, chargers and energy choices affect both convenience and confidence. For fleet buyers, practicality in everyday operations matters even more. To this end, Cycle & Carriages commercial vehicle leasing arm has already moved 100 per cent of its Light Goods Vehicle fleet to fully electric vans. Even its 100 per cent EV last-mile delivery service, myCourier, is racking up wins, with 120,000 kgCO₂e in greenhouse gas emissions saved for partners in 2024 – a number that speaks directly to business customers trying to decarbonise without compromising delivery performance. Addressing the idea that consumers today are spoilt for choice, yet appreciate the familiarity of a trusted hand, Cycle & Carriage has expanded its multi-brand portfolio while keeping the experience consistent. Its newer additions include EV brands such as Ora, Smart, Gogoro and Leapmotor, and a range of commercial vehicle solutions. Ora, Smart and Leapmotor offer a selection of compact to family-sized vehicles designed to meet diverse city and everyday mobility needs. Gogoro, on the other hand, offers electric two-wheelers with the worlds first two-wheel battery-swopping system. Cycle & Carriage is also investing in the physical spaces that reflect its multi-brand strategy. The Multi-Brand Complex at 239 Alexandra Road, for instance, houses Kia, Ora, Maxus, Peugeot, Leapmotor and Citroen, alongside the groups headquarters, with updates including a new Leapmotor showroom and refreshed showcase areas for Kia, Ora and Maxus. Says Mr Foo: The Cycle & Carriage brand and product portfolio aims to continually address different segments and needs across passenger and commercial mobility. Our brands are complementary by design. They enable choice, advance electrification and deliver value across private and commercial segments. This is how we aim to meet the diverse needs of Singapores mobility ecosystem. While $50 million may be a big number, the intent is clearly bigger: ensuring Cycle & Carriage remains relevant, even while electrification accelerates, sustainability expectations rise and customers judge brands as much by service experience as they do by specification sheets.

These jolts often follow a distinct pattern along the jaw or cheek, making the pain easy to mistake for a dental problem. But when your dentist finds nothing wrong, the real cause may betrigeminal neuralgia(TN). Trigeminal neuralgia is a neurological condition that occurs when a blood vessel presses on the facial nerve, triggering intense misfires, says Dr Nicolas Kon, a neurosurgeon and TN specialist atNeuro Asia Care. TN pain is often mistaken for dental problems because it can feel as if it originates from the teeth or gums – similar to that of a toothache. As a result, some patients undergo multiple dental treatments or extractions before realising the pain is actually neurological. According to Dr Kon, TN is most often caused by a blood vessel pressing on the nerve, damaging its protective layer and causing it to send pain signals. In rarer cases, conditions such as multiple sclerosis or a small tumour may also irritate the nerve. However, differentiating TN from dental pain is particularly tricky when the lower-jaw branch of the nerve is involved, which Dr Kon says is more common among Asian patients. TN pain is usually brief but extremely sharp and triggered by light touch. Dental pain, on the other hand, is more constant and pressure-sensitive, often worsening when biting down. The condition can significantly affect daily functioning. Dr Kon observes that some patients avoid solid food, stop talking or even smiling for fear of triggering pain, and that they find simple routines such as washing their face or putting on make-up daunting. This constant fear of sudden pain can lead to isolation. People may withdraw from social gatherings, avoid meals with friends or lose confidence at work. Over time, the stress can also lead to sleep problems and low mood, he says. Early signs of TN include short bursts of sharp, electric-like shocks on one side of the face that last for a few seconds but return repeatedly, often triggered by a gentle touch or movement. If the pain keeps recurring over days or weeks, or becomes more frequent, Dr Kon advises early diagnosis and treatment to prevent months, or even years, of unnecessary discomfort. He notes that globally, TN affects about 10 to 300 people per 100,000. In Singapore, TN is slightly more common among women aged 40 to 60, though younger people can also develop it. A detailed medical history, physical examination and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to see if a blood vessel is pressing against the nerve can distinguish TN from dental conditions, notes Dr Kon. While trigeminal neuralgia itself is not life-threatening, a thorough evaluation is important to rule out rare but serious causes such as tumours or multiple sclerosis, he adds. The first line of treatment for mild to moderate symptoms of TN is medication, says Dr Kon. These drugs help calm the overactive nerve signals that cause pain, but they control symptoms rather than cure the condition. They may lose efficacy over time and cause possible side effects like dizziness, drowsiness or brain fog, he notes. For more severe cases, or when medication no longer provides enough relief, other procedural options may be considered, says Dr Kon. These treatments may need to be repeated if symptoms return. One option is gamma knife radiosurgery, a non-invasive outpatient procedure that uses targeted radiation on the nerve root, with pain relief developing gradually over several weeks. Another is radiofrequency ablation, which uses controlled heat delivered through a fine needle to deactivate the part of the nerve causing pain. A third procedure ismicrovascular decompression(MVD) which gently moves the compressing blood vessel away from the nerve. Says Dr Kon: MVD directly addresses the underlying root cause of trigeminal neuralgia and is associated with long-term, medication-free recovery. Performed under general anaesthesia, MVD involves a small incision behind the ear. Using a keyhole approach, the neurosurgeon places a small pad between the nerve and the blood vessel pressing on it. Although every surgical procedure carries risks, MVD is well established and generally safe, says Dr Kon. He notes possible post-surgery side effects such as temporary facial numbness or mild balance problems but they usually resolve with time. By removing the pressure, the nerve can stop sending abnormal pain signals. For most patients, relief is almost immediate, says Dr Kon. For the small group of people who do not experience full relief immediately, the pain is often much milder and easier to manage than before, sometimes requiring only minimal medication. According to Dr Kon, MVD is most suitable for patients with classic TN and clear MRI evidence of a blood vessel compressing the nerve. It may not be ideal for those with medical conditions that make general anaesthesia risky or patients with atypical symptoms. Patients should discuss their personal risk factors with their neurosurgeon to find the safest and most effective path forward, he says.

Vietnamese caught in Japans illegal worker crackdown,"Jan 07, 2026, 12:45 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 12:45 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/39a2cc91415542e9a4338502d470513b3d77d29d7092a65cbe5a186960b25f9b,"Vietnamese nun Thich Tam Tri (second from left) holding a gathering with members of the Vietnamese community at Daionji temple in the city of Honjo, Saitama Prefecture, in July 2024.PHOTO: AFP","['Japan', 'Vietnam', 'Immigration laws', 'Foreign workers']","TOKYO - For a decade, Vietnamese worker Minh did tough jobs like sandblasting ships and welding steel, helping address rapidly ageing Japans dire labour needs. But now, having overstayed his visa, he is in the crosshairs of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichis promisedcrackdown on illegal workers. Mr Minh, a pseudonym used to protect his identity, came to Japan in 2015 under its Technical Intern Training Program (TITP), which is billed as a way for foreign workers to learn skills to take back to developing countries. But critics say it also helps Japan get cheap workers who are vulnerable to debt and exploitation, with some of them deserting their jobs and falling into crime. A lot of Japanese people look only at the surface – that foreigners committed crimes, Mr Minh, a former TITP intern living near Tokyo, told AFP. They dont think about the root cause of it: how and why these foreigners got to that point. Of the roughly 450,000 technical interns in Japan as of June, just under half were from Vietnam and worked across agriculture, construction and food processing. Many arrive heavily indebted with recruitment and brokerage fees – including Mr Minh, who intended to work to pay off the US$7,500 (S$9,605) he owed and send money to his family. But with opportunities scarce back home at the end of his three years, finding a welding job as an undocumented labourer proved much simpler. Without foreign workers like us, there is no way Japans economy can function, the 30-year-old said. Immigration levels in Japan remain low compared with other rich economies. But with an ageing population, one of the worlds lowest birth rates and labour shortages across industries, the number of foreign workers has hit record levels. That, along with dwindling salaries in real terms and higher living costs, has seen resentment towards foreign workers swell. Anger at (Japanese peoples) own financial struggles is taken out on foreigners, Ms Jiho Yoshimizu, head of a Tokyo-based non-profit supporting Vietnamese nationals, told AFP. Since taking office, Ms Takaichi has vowed action, promising a policy package later in January that will reportedly includestricter visa management. The proportion of crimes committed by non-Japanese is low; 5.5 per cent of the roughly 190,000 people arrested in 2024 for penal code offences were foreigners, according to police. Separate police data shows that among foreigners arrested in 2024 – excluding those with permanent residency and others – Vietnamese topped the list at over 30 per cent, including for theft. The figures are partly explained by surging numbers of Vietnamese – up ninefold from a decade ago – who now make up a quarter of Japans 2.3-million-strong foreign workforce and are the biggest contingent. Overstaying his visa aside, Mr Minh says he has never been involved in crime. He considers his internship a success, despite his extremely dirty task of sandblasting rust off ships, a job he says few Japanese on site were saddled with. Ms Yoshimizu said that some technical interns are stuck in conditions that they just have to flee. Though most employers are conscientious, common complaints include low wages, sub-par housing and sexual harassment, she added. Under the rules of the scheme, interns are usually forced to stay with their employers, even if they are unhappy. Japans immigration agency says around 6,500 trainees disappeared from their workplaces last year. Absconders may turn to Facebook communities dubbed Bodoi – a vernacular term for soldiers – to look for black market jobs, or sometimes they are illegally hired through brokers by labour-hungry businesses, Ms Yoshimizu said. Those who find these unofficial gigs can get by, but those who dont can be driven into committing crimes like selling drugs, she added. The government plans to transition TITP into a new system in 2027, with more flexibility for job transfers but imposing stricter requirements on Japanese language skills. Still, it remains unclear whether the programme will continue to attract high-quality candidates. The yens weakness has devalued remittances sent home and there is increasing competition from labour markets such as South Korea, denting Japans reputation among Vietnamese, immigration expert Jotaro Kato told AFP. Japans programme is increasingly reliant on Vietnamese applicants with less motivation and educational qualifications than before, the Meiji Gakuin University associate professor said. Vietnamese nun Thich Tam Tri – whose temple north of Tokyo offers shelter to her compatriots in trouble – said some interns make poor choices, falling into debt through gambling or ill-advised ventures into Bitcoin. But technical interns contribute greatly to Japanese society, she said. It pains me to see how one bad headline can easily prejudice Japanese people against them. In July, a Vietnamese trainee was arrested for robbing and murdering a Japanese woman in her 40s. Thats why we have to do as many good deeds as possible to normalise this image of us, and regain the trust of Japanese people.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) could not rule out the possibility that information from the agency-issued device was leaked, and reported the incident to Japans Personal Information Protection Commission when it happened in November, according to an NRA official who asked not to be named. The employee informed the NRA that the phone, which contained information like names and contacts of people working at the agency, may have been lost at an airport, the NRA official told Bloomberg News on Jan 7. The official declined to say which country the device was misplaced in, as it happened during a personal trip. Kyodo News reported the employee contacted an airport in Shanghai upon realising the phone was lost, but could not find it. The incident is the latest in a series of missteps that threatens to sour public trust in nuclear oversight at a time when Japan is pushing to restart its fleet of idled reactors. In 2023, an employee at Tokyo Electric Power Co, which operates the worlds largest nuclear plant, placed a stack of documents on top of a car before driving off and losing them. It also follows a major regional utility announcing on Jan 5 that there may have beenmisconduct over how it compiled key safety data, potentially posing a further delay to the restart of its nuclear plant. A stringent regulatory process has delayed Japan from restarting most of its nuclear reactors shut in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration","['Taiwan', 'China']","TAIPEI, Jan 7 - Chinas war game exercises around Taiwan last week were part of a campaign to counter growing international support for the island and an attempt to divert attention away from Beijings economic troubles, Taiwans top security agency said on Wednesday. As part of its exercises, called Justice Mission 2025, China fired dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deployed a large number of warships and aircraft near the island. That caused dozens of domestic flights in Taiwan to be cancelled and drew concern from allies in the region and the West. The Taiwan-focused drills carried clear political intent: to push back in the international arena against democratic partners support for Taiwan, the National Security Bureau said in a report to Parliament. A copy of the report was reviewed by Reuters. The drills, Chinas most extensive war games to date by coverage area, were also meant to redirect public anger over economic setbacks and social disorder at home into nationalist sentiment framed as resisting external interference, the report said. The report said China has been ramping up a hybrid campaign to pressure Taiwan militarily and economically, drawing resistance from democratic partners in the U.S. and Europe. The report also pointed to a comment from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about Taiwan late last year. She said a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan. The report said the comment underscored how security in the Taiwan Strait was viewed as directly linked to stability in the Indo-Pacific and international order. Chinas Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment on the report. Speaking at a regular press conference on Wednesday, the office said recent military drills around Taiwan, including those held last week, were intended to staunchly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The exercises were also aimed at upholding the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the strait and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, it said. Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taipei strongly objects to Chinas sovereignty claims and says only Taiwans people can decide their future. The report said that during the drills, China used state media, artificial intelligence-generated content and online troll armies to amplify its narratives, cast doubt on the Taiwanese militarys capabilities and undermine trust in President Lai Ching-te and the U.S. Some 19,000 controversial messages were pushed out across several social media platforms by 799 accounts in the span of five days, the report said. On the first and second day of the drills, Taiwans government received more than two million cyberattacks, the report said. It named the Peoples Liberation Army‑linked hacking groups APT24 and BlackTech as being among the most active participants. Chinas armed forces have been synchronising hacking campaigns with military drills around Taiwan to disrupt the islands cybersecurity environment and unsettle public morale, the report said. China has routinely denied being involved in hacking attacks. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/taiwan-says-chinas-war-games-sought-to-undermine-global-support-for-the-island

In a recent document sent to the Ministry of Construction, the municipal Peoples Committee asked that passenger services on the national railway section between Hanoi Station and Gia Lam Station be adjusted. Under the proposal, southbound passenger trains would terminate at Hanoi Station, while northbound services would stop at Gia Lam. Passenger transfers between the two stations would be handled by the citys construction and transport authorities. If implemented, the change would mean there will be no passenger trains passing through the stretch of track between Hanoi Station and Long Bien Station, where the cafe-lined railway runs through densely populated neighbourhoods in the inner city. The city has also asked the ministry to hand over the management of national railway infrastructure on the Gia Lam–Hanoi section by the second quarter of 2026. This would allow the capital to carry out urban renewal and conservation projects on the western edge of the Old Quarter and the eastern area of the central heritage zone around the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long. The railway cafe street, located mainly in the Kham Thien and Phung Hung areas of Hoan Kiem district, has become one of Hanois most photographed attractions in recent years – to the chagrin of local authorities. Videos and images of tourists sipping coffee just centimetres from rumbling trains have gone viral on social media platforms, drawing large numbers of foreign visitors. Local authorities have repeatedly warned that the site poses serious safety risks. The cafes operate on land originally designated as a railway safety corridor, where construction and commercial activities are prohibited. During peak tourist hours, visitors often crowd onto the tracks to take photos, obstructing the railway and leaving little room for error when trains pass through. Over the past few years, Hanoi has launched several enforcement campaigns, temporarily closing cafes and ordering tourists to leave the area when trains are due. Yet, the measures have proved difficult to sustain, as businesses often reopen once inspections end and tourists continue to be drawn by the sites online fame. According to the city government, the proposal is part of a broader plan to preserve and enhance the historical and cultural value of the railway corridor, particularly around the iconic Long Bien Bridge where there is also the train track. The city is working with the French Embassys economic agency on a technical assistance project to study renovation options for the bridge, focusing on traffic safety and heritage conservation. Hanoi also plans to develop cultural, service and tourism spaces around the 131 stone railway arches beneath the elevated track running from Hanoi Station to Long Bien, along streets such as Phung Hung and Gam Cau. These arches have already been partially transformed into art spaces and cafes in recent years. At the same time, the city says it will study architectural solutions for the planned urban railway Line No. 1 as it passes through the Old Quarter and the French Quarter, with the aim of avoiding damage to the areas historic urban fabric.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania and Lesotho on this years trip. Wangs visit to Somalia - the first by a Chinese foreign minister since the 1980s - is likely to provide Mogadishu with a diplomatic boost after Israel last month became the first country to formally recognise the breakaway Republic of Somaliland, a northern region that declared itself independent in 1991. Beijing, which reiterated its support for Somalia after the Israeli announcement, is keen to buttress its influence around the Gulf of Aden, the entry to the Red Sea and a crucial corridor for Chinese trade heading through the Suez Canal to European markets. Further south, Tanzania is central to Beijings push to secure access to Africas vast copper deposits. Chinese firms are refurbishing the Tazara Railway that runs through the country into Zambia. Li Qiang made a landmark trip to Zambia in November, the first visit by a Chinese premier in 28 years. The railway is widely seen as a counterweight to the U.S. and European Union-backed Lobito Corridor, which connects Zambia to Atlantic ports via Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By visiting the southern African kingdom of Lesotho, Wang aims to highlight Beijings push to position itself as a champion of free trade. Last year, China offered tariff-free market access to its $19 trillion economy for the worlds poorest nations, fulfilling a pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2024 China-Africa Cooperation summit in Beijing. Lesotho, one of the worlds poorest nations with a gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, was among the countries hardest hit by U.S. President Donald Trumps sweeping tariffs last year, facing duties of up to 50% on its exports to the United States.

Dual-use items are goods, software or technologies that have both civilian and military applications, including certain rare earth elements that are essential for making drones and chips. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi touched off the dispute with Beijing late in 2025 by saying a Chinese attack on democratically-governed Taiwan could be deemed an existential threat to Japan. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, a claim the island rejects. Beijing has demanded she retract the remarks,which she has not done, prompting a series of countermeasures, the latest of which was the ban on exports of dual-use items for military use on Jan 6. A measure such as this, targeting only our country, differs significantly from international practice, is absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable, Japans Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told a daily press conference on Jan 7. He declined to comment on the possible impact on Japanese industry, saying it remained unclear exactly what items would be targeted. The reaction from markets to the news was relatively muted though Japanese shares were lower on Jan 7, bucking a global trend that carried US and European benchmarks to record highs. Japans broad Topix gauge of equities slid 0.55 per cent, with a subindex of mining shares leading declines, down 3.2 per cent. China Daily, a newspaper owned by the ruling Chinese Communist Party, reported on Jan 6 that Beijing was considering tightening the licence review of rare earth exports to Japan more broadly, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. Such a move could have sweeping implications for the manufacturing powerhouse, including its key automotive sector, analysts say. While Japan has sought to diversify its supply of rare earths since China last throttled exports of the minerals in 2010, around 60 per cent of its imports still come from China. A three-month curb on Chinese exports of rare earths, like that seen during the 2010, could cost Japanese businesses 660 billion yen (S$5.4 billion) and shave 0.11 per cent of annual gross domestic product, Nomura Research Institute economist Takahide Kiuchi said in a note on Jan 7. A year-long ban would knock 0.43 per cent off GDP, he added. So far, China Customs data has shown no sign of a decline in rare earth exports to Japan, though the data is released with some delay. In November, the latest month for which there was data, exports grew 35 per cent to 305 tonnes, the highest tally in 2025.

That hierarchy is now quietly shifting. The countrys dollar-store chain Daiso, long associated with household essentials and impulse buys, is emerging as an unlikely but increasingly influential beauty destination. What stands out is not simply the presence of low-priced cosmetics, but who is choosing to sell them there. Premium and professional brands that once kept a clear distance from flat-price channels are now moving in deliberately, reframing Daiso as more than a testing ground for small labels. Instead, it is becoming a strategic stage in brand planning. The clearest such signal came with the launch of Zoom by Jung Saem Mool, a Daiso-exclusive collaboration with the renowned, artist-led brand, unveiled online on Jan 5. Thirteen items - including skin pads, spatula foundations and foundation cushions – went on sale with prices ranging from 1,000 won (90 Singapore cents) to 5,000 won. This carried symbolic weight for a brand whose base products typically sell for 40,000 to 50,000 won, and which limits discounting even at major retailers. Jung Saem Mools arrival at Daiso underscores how far the dollar store has evolved from its former cheap-only image. Daiso said the launch aligns with its broader direction. As with other categories, we aim to introduce a wider variety of products in our beauty lineup, the company said, adding that the collaboration was designed to allow more customers to easily experience beauty products that reflect makeup artist Jung Saem-mools expertise in their everyday routines. Jung Saem Mool is not alone. Daisos beauty shelves have expanded well beyond their earlier focus on road-shop staples such as Tonymoly and Nature Republic. The lineup now includes derma and pharmaceutical-backed brands such as CNP and Dongkook Pharmaceutical, alongside established skincare names including VT and Medipeel. Some brands appear under their original names, while others operate Daiso-only secondary lines. Many are developing Daiso-exclusive lines from the planning stage, with separate pricing, compositions and target consumers. This approach minimises brand dilution while allowing labels to work within Daisos fixed price structure. The appeal is not limited to a single generation. According to Daiso membership data, cosmetic sales in November 2025 were evenly distributed across age groups from shoppers in their 20s to those aged 60 and older. Consumers in their 40s accounted for the largest share, while those in their 20s and 30s also formed a core customer base. An industry expert said sustaining the trend will require balance. For premium brands to continue launching Daiso-exclusive lines, the key challenge lies in maintaining clear quality standards, transparency in labeling and advertising, and positioning differences from existing lines in a way consumers can clearly understand, the expert said.

REUTERS/Fawaz Salman","['Yemen', 'Saudi Arabia']","Jan 7 - The leader of Yemens Southern Transitional Council (STC), Aidarous al-Zubaidi, failed to board a plane set to take him to Riyadh, and fled instead to an unknown destination, the Saudi-backed coalition in the country said on Wednesday. The remarks came amid efforts to end fighting that erupted last month between the STC, backed by the United Arab Emirates, and Yemens Saudi-backed internationally recognised government, which has triggered a major feud between the Gulf allies. Zubaidi was set to travel to Saudi Arabia days after Yemens government said it had asked Riyadh to host a forum on the southern issue. In a statement, coalition spokesperson Turki al-Maliki said a flight carrying a large number of senior leaders of the separatist group departed after a delay of more than three hours without Zubaidi, and with no information on his whereabouts. During the delay information became available indicating that he had moved large forces, Maliki added, citing calls for mobilisation and the movement and arming of factions with light and medium weapons. The feud between the UAE and Saudi Arabia has fractured a coalition originally created to fight the Iran-aligned Houthis, who are still the dominant military force in Yemen. The Houthis seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014 and Gulf countries intervened the following year in support of the internationally recognised government, splitting Yemen into rival zones of control. The coalition also said it carried out limited pre-emptive airstrikes in Yemens southern province of al-Dhalea after monitoring the movements of armed forces that had left their camps. Domestic sources and sources within the STC reported more than 15 strikes in the province, the birthplace of Zubaidi. Following the developments, the Saudi-backed presidential council stripped Zubaidi of his membership and referred him to the public prosecutor on charges including high treason, state news agency SABA said. The decision, issued by council chairman Rashad al-Alimi, accused Zubaidi of inciting armed rebellion, attacking constitutional authorities and committing abuses against civilians in southern Yemen.

The J6ers, as they refer to themselves, have been emboldened by US President Donald Trump, who pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly 1,600 people who planned or participated in storming the Capitol to protest against the results of the 2020 election. During the Jan 6 anniversary march, they praised Mr Trump for setting them free, but were critical of his administration for not doing more for them. Retribution is what we seek, said Mr Enrique Tarrio, a far-right activist and leader of the Proud Boys, one of the organisers of the Jan 6, 2021, demonstration and the Jan 6 anniversary event. Without accountability, there is no justice. I am loyal to Donald Trump, but my loyalty doesnt extend to his administration, said Mr Barry Ramey, who was convicted of assaulting a police officer during the Capitol riot, an act he says he regrets. He listed Attorney-General Pam Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigation director Kash Patel among Trump administration officials who could be doing a better job. The marchers had a range of demands, including financial restitution and prison reform. But it is not clear how closely the Trump administration is listening. No Trump administration officials were present at the Jan 6 march and rally, despite the White House unveiling a formal effort to paint the rioters as innocent victims of police provocation. Many of Mr Trumps allies who had promoted the event, like Mr Steve Bannon, were also noticeably absent – leaving Mr Tarrio as the most prominent headliner. The anniversary march attendees also appeared to be divided over how to handle their return to the spotlight. The Jan 6 rally and march were advertised as a memorial for Ms Ashli Babbitt – who was shot on Jan 6, 2021, as she tried to enter the House chamber – and other protesters who died during the Capitol attack. Several participants laid flowers around the Capitol in Ms Babbitts honor. But the event was more boisterous and defiant than a vigil, as reunited participants cheered their pardons and jeered the police officers who had been tasked to protect the protest route, outnumbering the marchers. This is a gratifying celebration in defiance of tyranny, said Mr Samuel Lazar, holding up a painting he had commissioned of himself shaking Mr Trumps hand in front of the Capitol amid a sea of other people who had been pardoned for their actions on Jan 6, 2021. Another throng of marchers encircled a group of DC police officers, saying shame, shame and calling them murderous thugs and subhuman scum. Organisers quietly thanked other police officers for keeping counter-protesters at bay. Law enforcement officers shut down more than a mile of Constitution Avenue, which runs through a part of Washington that is home to several federal buildings, even though the marchers took up less than a block. On several occasions, verbal altercations broke out between marchers and counter-protesters who scattered along the route, as each side used bullhorns to amplify the insults, epithets and curses they exchanged. Terrorists, one man yelled at the marchers as they passed. Your wifes boyfriend voted for Trump, retorted a Jan 6 marcher. During one heated exchange between a group of counter-protesters and marchers near the Capitol, Mr Guy Reffitt, who was a member of the militia group known as the Three Percenters and was the first Jan 6 defendant to be convicted, used a microphone and amplifier to remind marchers that they were at a memorial, and not in Washington to protest. Several participants in the anniversary march said that they wanted to see the police officers they blamed for the deaths of Capitol rioters be brought to justice. Others said they were looking to the government for financial restitution, citing how the months – or in some cases, years – they spent in prison had upended their lives. Im building from nothing now, Mr Reffitt said in an interview, saying his career had been ruined. I personally feel like we should get something back to fix what theyve taken from us. Still, others said they were fighting for prison reform, after experiencing the indignities and harsh conditions of federal penitentiaries. But progress on those fronts will be a challenge. Despite having been pardoned, the march participants are still polarising, inspiring disgust from critics and caution from Mr Trumps more mainstream Republican allies. To see that these criminals, these violent criminals who attacked our Capitol five years ago, would return to the scene of their crime to gloat in the face of the democracy theyre trying to overthrow – that made me sick to my stomach, said Mr Spencer Pilcher, who held a sign that read January 6ers Belong in Prison (and so does Trump), with a swastika emblem scratched out.

Instead, the iconic Imperial March anthem could come from your Lego sets themselves, after the Danish toy company unveiled the Smart Brick, which adds sound and light to playtime. The Smart Bricks will be introduced in three Star Wars sets launching on March 1, and were unveiled alongside Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas on Jan 5. The 2x2 Smart Tag tiles contain unique digital IDs that tell the Smart Bricks how to act, while the Smart Minifigures trigger unique sounds, movements and reactions from the bricks when paired. Made in the form of a regular 2x4 Lego brick, the Smart Brick contains accelerometers – which detect and measure movement – and can also sense light and sound. Each Smart Brick also has a miniature speaker driven by an onboard synthesiser, and can be charged wirelessly. This means Lego and Star Wars fan can make their sets come to life with whoosh sounds, droid R2-D2 beeps and lightsaber sounds when Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader clash. A Lego executive added that The Imperial March might also be played occasionally just to get the vibe going, reported The Guardian. The Smart Brick innovation is not limited to just Star Wars sets.In a demonstration at CES, a Lego plane affixed with the Smart Brick emitted whooshing sounds, and a Lego duck fitted with the innovation began quacking.The BBC reported that in its own test at CES, a Lego birthday cake recognised when its candles were blown out – sounding a cheer and a birthday song. Lego said the Smart Play System is its most revolutionary innovation in nearly 50 years.

Bogota has long suspected that leaders of powerful groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN), which controls cocaine trafficking routes along the border, and factions of the now defunct FARC guerrilla army live in Venezuela. Security experts say the ELN has rear bases within Venezuela that were tolerated by Maduro, who denied it. A Colombian armed forces officer told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity on Jan 6 that he had received reports of guerrilla leaders trying to cross the border back home after Washingtons weekend raid. The presence of guerrilla kingpins along the border constitutes a threat to Colombias security after Maduros fall, according to the Defence Ministry in Bogota. When theousted Venezuelan leader was sent to New York to face justice, Bogota issued an alert over possible attacks and deployed thousands of troops to the more than 2,200km border. AFP on Jan 6 observed Colombian soldiers in the border city of Cucuta. US President Donald Trump had warned Colombian President Gustavo Petro – whom he has accused, without providing evidence, of being a drug lord – to watch his ass.

He was 84 and had been a federal prisoner, serving life without parole, since 1994. The death was recorded in the federal Bureau of Prisons inmate database. A spokesperson said he died at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland. The son of an alcoholic CIA officer, Ames failed upward through the agency ranks for 17 years until he attained a headquarters post of extraordinary sensitivity. He became the chief of the counter-intelligence branch of the CIAs Soviet division in September 1983. He had access to some of the nations deepest secrets – in particular, its clandestine liaisons with the Soviets, who worked in secret with US intelligence. These were a small cadre, barely a dozen all told, who were cultivated over the course of two decades and well-placed in Soviet government agencies and embassies around the world. As the Cold War was cresting, Ames decided that he would change the course of history by upending a long-running game of nations, the contest of spy versus spy. He saw it as a charade. By his own account, he was fuelled by a toxic cocktail of vodka, arrogance, delusions of grandeur and naked greed. In April 1985, he took his first gamble. He hand-delivered an envelope addressed to the KGB chief at the Soviet Embassy in Washington. He offered a smattering of CIA secrets, and he requested US$50,000 in return. He identified himself by name and rank. The relationship was sealed over a long, boozy lunch at an elegant hotel near the White House. Then he bet the house. Ames feared that one of the CIAs Russians might betray him, so he decided to betray them all. He knew he would be paid a fortune. I panicked, he said in a 1994 interview with The New York Times, conducted from jail. Only by suddenly giving them everyone would he be protected – and he knew in return that he would be paid as much money as I could ever use, if I chose to do that. Ames put together hundreds of secret documents in a 2.7kg stack – a whos who of Soviets working for the CIA and an encyclopaedia of US intelligence operations behind the Iron Curtain. He stuffed them in his briefcase, walked out of headquarters and delivered them to a contact at the Soviet Embassy. I was delivering myself along with them, he said in the 1994 interview. I was saying, Over to you, KGB. You guys take care of me now. The KGB took care of him – he was paid at least US$2.7 million – and it took care of its own turncoats. As many as 10 Soviet and Soviet-bloc spies were arrested, interrogated and executed for treason. One was imprisoned. At least two escaped, one step ahead of their pursuers. The network that had provided the US with political, military, diplomatic and intelligence insights on Moscow was destroyed. The KGB did its best to fill that void with disinformation and double agents for the rest of the Cold War. These deceptions distorted the debate over policy and strategy towards Moscow at the highest levels of US government, Mr John M. Deutch, the CIAs director in 1995, said at the time, and they subverted the CIA in its central mission of the Cold War: understanding the Soviet threat. The falsehoods sustained the view that the Soviet Union was a superpower, even as it was collapsing. Ames also revealed the identities of two dozen other US intelligence officers and foreign agents working for the CIA and exposed some 50 secret operations in Russia, Europe and Latin America, the agency concluded. As the CIAs Russians disappeared, one by one by one, the agency began to fear that it had a traitor in its midst. But the search for the mole sputtered and ground to a halt. In 1986, Ames went on a three-year assignment in Rome, where he devoted much of his time to rooting out secrets for the Soviets and drinking his lunch; he once passed out in the street after a US Embassy party. Then, in 1989, a CIA officer reported that Ames, on returning to Washington, was inexplicably wealthy: He had paid US$540,000 in cash for a new home near the agencys headquarters, and he was driving a new Jaguar. This set off the faintest of alarms. The agencys clandestine service took more than a year to forward these concerns to its internal-security office. That office assigned one investigator to the case, an inexperienced man in his 20s, who put the investigation aside for months. It was not until 1993 that a formal criminal investigation began, spurred in large part by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI put handcuffs on Ames on Feb 21, 1994, and he became a prisoner from that day on. Ames, who was known as Rick, was born on May 26, 1941, in River Falls, Wisconsin, the eldest of three children and the only son of Professor Carleton Ames, of European and Asian history at the local state teachers college, and Mrs Rachel (Aldrich) Ames, a high school English teacher. In 1951, a recruiter from the CIA came to River Falls and offered Prof Ames a job. China had gone communist, the Korean War was raging, and the agency, barely four years old, was casting its net far and wide for Americans who thought they knew how Asians think. In 1953, the Ameses of River Falls landed in the capital of Burma, now Myanmar, with Prof Ames under cover as a Ford Foundation scholar. His daytime drinking was apparent to fellow American expatriates. He was a failure as a spy, winning no confidences and recruiting no agents. But he did impart one secret: On a steamboat headed up the Irrawaddy River towards Mandalay, 12-year-old Aldrich Ames learnt that his father worked for the CIA. He was intrigued. In 1957, after the family returned to the Washington area, he took a summer job at the agency as a handyman. In 1962, three years after graduating from high school, he joined the CIA as a clerk at the agencys headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Five years later, after earning a college degree in history from George Washington University, he officially joined the nations clandestine service at the age of 26. He married a fellow spy, Ms Nancy Segebarth, in May 1969, and they set off together for the CIA station in Ankara, Turkey. Ames was a disappointment to his station chief Duane Clarridge, who wrote him up as unfit for the life of a spy overseas and best suited for a desk job far behind the front lines of the Cold War. He earned a billet on the home front by learning Russian and joining the CIAs Soviet division. The distinct smell of alcohol kept wafting up from his personnel file. Worse, Ames left a briefcase with highly sensitive documents on a train, potentially exposing a Soviet diplomat working for the CIA. Yet he was promoted twice: to the New York station, which focused on the United Nations, and then, in 1981, to Mexico City, a hotbed of Soviet espionage in the Western Hemisphere. Ames closeted himself in his classified quarters, did little or no work and began hitting the bottle as never before. After a drink-driving incident and a near-brawl at an embassy reception, his station chief recommended a medical leave for his alcohol abuse. Headquarters did nothing. With his marriage unravelling, Ames wooed Ms Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, the cultural attache at the Colombian Embassy and a recruited CIA source. He asked her to marry him – she said she would – and he belatedly asked for the CIAs approval. An extramarital relationship with a foreign national was a potential career-ender. In Ames case, however, it was not. After he won a divorce, they married. In 1983, Ames became the Soviet divisions counter-intelligence chief and began calling for the files on the CIAs most sensitive operations. His wife, who went by Rosario, was arrested along with her husband – she had learnt about his treason and happily spent the proceeds – and received a five-year prison term. Their son Paul, then five years old, went to live with his mothers relatives in Colombia. At his 1994 sentencing, Ames denounced American espionage as a self-serving sham run by bureaucrats who had deceived generations of Americans about the value and necessity of their work. The CIAs director at the time, Mr R. James Woolsey, decided that no one should be punished for dereliction of duty in the Ames case, despite a determination by the agencys inspector general that 23 senior officials bore responsibility. He instead issued 11 letters of reprimand. A damage assessment by CIA and FBI officials never got to the bottom of the case. Ames, his memory damaged by alcohol, could not recall the scope of the secrets he sold. And he failed the polygraphs, or lie-detector tests, they gave him, leaving them in doubt as they assayed a decade of deception and destruction. Ames was clear on one count in his 1994 interview with the Times. He said he had sentenced himself to a living death: The men I sold... What happened to them also happened to me.

REUTERS/Kaylee Greenlee Beal/File Photo",['Police'],"Jan 6 - The first day of the trial of a police officer who responded to the 2022 shooting at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two teachers was interrupted on Tuesday after a witness provided testimony not previously presented to the defense. Texas state Judge Sid Harle dismissed the jury until Thursday and ordered the prosecution and defense to return on Wednesday to work through the issues raised by the testimony from a former teacher at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde. The defenses objections to the testimony could lead to it being stricken, or to the extreme and rarely granted remedy of a mistrial. Former Uvalde school district police officer Adrian Gonzales, 52, is on trial in Nueces County Court in Corpus Christi for his role as one of 376 officers from local, state and federal agencies who responded to the shooting. Police were criticized for waiting 77 minutes before entering the classroom where the gunman was holed up, despite teachers and students making calls to 911 emergency services, saying they were in the room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies. The trial was moved to Corpus Christi after the defense successfully argued Gonzales could not get a fair trial in Uvalde. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty to the 29 counts of child endangerment he faces for allegedly failing to confront the gunman, who was later killed by other officers. Stephanie Hale, who was a third grade teacher at the school on the day, testified that she saw the gunman on the south side of the school and also that she saw dust kicked up on that side of the school, potentially indicating that shots were fired. Defense lawyer Jason Goss, during cross examination, said he was surprised by Hales testimony and that she did not tell police or a grand jury about seeing the gunman or seeing dust kicked up when she spoke with investigators after the shooting. Hale was then allowed to listen to the interview she gave investigators shortly after the shooting, without the jury present. Goss asked Hale if she would now agree that she never told investigators that she had seen the gunman or dirt flying up, to which Hale replied: Correct. Hale was then asked by Goss if, during preparation for the trial, she had told prosecutors details about seeing the gunman and the dirt, to which she replied: I believe so, yes. Goss said that if Hale had reported such matters to the prosecution, his side was entitled to have been informed before trial under U.S. law. This is a trial by ambush, Goss said in court, evoking the legal requirement that the prosecution not be surprised by the defense with evidence. Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell, who is overseeing the prosecution, told the judge that Hale had never told her team the specific location where she had seen the gunman or that she saw dirt flying up. Outside court, the main defense lawyer, Nico LaHood, told reporters that a mistrial is a remedy allowed by law, but were not saying were going to take that remedy or not, or argue for that remedy. DID WHAT HE COULD Gonzales, who had spent a decade as a Uvalde city police officer before joining the school districts force about a year before the shooting, was charged in 2024 with the child endangerment counts, according to his indictment, which said that he failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter and that he also failed to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire. Each count carries the possibility of two years in prison to run concurrently. Adrian Gonzales does nothing more than mike his microphone and tell other officers whats going on, special prosecutor Bill Turner told the jury during his opening statement, repeatedly choking back tears as he spoke in the courtroom in Corpus Christi, Texas, where the trial was moved after the defense argued Gonzales could not get a fair trial in Uvalde. The children inside the building were hiding and waiting for officers to come to their aid, the prosecutor added, but Gonzales and other police waited outside as the slaughter begins. Two defense attorneys, in their opening statement, emphasized the chaotic scene and said that at no point did Gonzales see the gunman or fully understand where the gunman was, making it difficult to confront him. He did what he could with what he knew at the time, LaHood said of his client. Pedro Pete Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of child endangerment. His trial has not yet been scheduled. State and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with children while weighing how to confront him.

Valente, 48, a Portuguese national who had attended Brown two decades ago as a doctoral student in physics, slipped into an engineering building on the Ivy League campus on December 13 and opened fire with a handgun, killing two students and injuring nine others, according to police. Authorities later determined that after fleeing the Providence, Rhode Island, scene of the Brown attack, Valente killed a physics professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a separate shooting at his home outside Boston. Valente and the slain MIT professor Nuno Loureiro had once been classmates in Lisbon, authorities said after linking the two shooting incidents. But investigators have yet to offer a motive for either case. The newly released transcripts of the videos, recovered by the FBI from an electronic device and translated from Portuguese to English, mark the first statements attributed to Valente since his death but shed little new light on the Brown tragedy. According to the U.S. Attorneys Office in Boston, which has overseen the federal investigation of the shootings, Valente admitted that he had been planning the Brown University shooting for a long time. In the rambling, disjointed recordings prosecutors say he made while holed up in the storage unit after the shootings, Valente refers to a shell casing injuring one of his eyes and adds that he had already planned this for a little more than six semesters. Except for repeated mentions of his eye injury, however, Valente speaks elliptically of what has happened, never explicitly talks about firing a gun or killing anyone, and offers no insights into what precipitated the violence ascribed to him. I dont know if there are any kind of implications of what I wanted to do or not, he said. It was all incompetent, but at least something was done. ... The only objective was to [pause] leave more or less on my own terms and -- and its -- its already long overdue. He alludes to vague, unspecified grievances, while expressing no remorse. To say that I was extraordinarily satisfied, no, but I also dont regret what I did, he said in one video. I am not going to apologize, because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me. Federal prosecutors said that the evidence collected to date continues to rule out any basis for concerns about ongoing public safety threats associated with the shootings, but that investigators search for a motive would continue.

The guidance, along with comments from FDA commissioner Marty Makary, adds to existing policy that classifies low-risk wellness tools, such as fitness apps and activity trackers that encourage exercise, as non-medical devices exempt from stringent regulation, provided they do not make claims related to disease diagnosis or treatment. We have to promote these products, and at the same time, just guard against major safety concerns, Mr Makary said in an interview with Fox Business about artificial intelligence (AI) software such as ChatGPT, adding that if people are looking up a symptom on an AI-based tool, lets have that conversation when they come in to see their doctor or do a virtual visit. Shares of continuous glucose monitor manufacturers Abbott, Medtronic and Dexcom closed between 1 per cent and 4 per cent higher. US-listed shares of fitness smartwatch maker Garmin ended nearly 3 per cent higher. We want to let companies know, with very clear guidance, that if their device or software is simply providing information, they can do that without FDA regulation, Mr Makary told Fox Business. The only stipulation is if they make claims of something being medical grade... like blood pressure measurement. We dont want people changing their medicine based on something thats just a screening tool or an estimate of a physiologic parameter. In 2025, the FDA issued a warning letter to fitness band maker Whoop, saying its blood-pressure insights feature blurred the line between wellness and medical devices by estimating systolic and diastolic values used to diagnose hypertension. The agency also sent out a broader warning to consumers about the risks posed by unauthorised devices.

Forum: Concerned over synchronised fee hikes at driving centres,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'CCCS/Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore', 'Competition laws', 'Cars']","The decision by the three driving centres in Singapore – ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, Bukit Batok Driving Centre and Singapore Safety Driving Centre – to raise fees from Jan 1 for practical lessons, theory classes and simulator training bears the hallmarks of cartel-like behaviour that penalises consumers (Driving centres in Singapore hike learner fees in 2026, Jan 4). The fee hikes, ranging from 6.8 per cent to over 25.2 per cent for specific modules, are being implemented at a time when learners are already struggling with a bottlenecked system. The demand for learning slots now far outstrips supply. This chronic imbalance has created a market where driving centres have zero incentive to improve productivity or streamline operations. Instead, they operate in a sellers market where learners have no choice but to pay whatever is demanded just to secure a slot. When all players in a limited market raise prices at the same time, it suggests a lack of genuine competition. In a healthy, competitive landscape, at least one provider would maintain or lower prices to capture the massive overflow of demand. Instead, we see a coordinated upward trend that suggests the centres are comfortable increasing fees with impunity, knowing that their customer base is captive and desperate. The justifications provided – such as rising operational costs and instructor wages – must be scrutinised. If productivity is not being enhanced to offset these costs, the burden is simply shifted to the young Singaporeans and workers for whom a driving licence is a vital asset for employment. I urge the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singaporeto investigate the fee structures. We need to ensure that the price adjustments are a result of market forces and not a lack of competitive spirit among the only three providers in the country.

Forum: Bring down CIQ costs for pleasure craft owners in Singapore,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:37 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Travel and leisure', 'Singapore Customs']","I wish to highlight the high cost faced by owners of pleasure craft (boats used for sport, recreational or leisure purposes) when leaving and entering Singapore, and to urge the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to consider a more practical and affordable alternative. Pleasure craft can clear Customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) only at a few designated private marinas. These marinas typically charge about $300 per clearance, purportedly to cover armed guards and the maintenance of CIQ working space. Pleasure craft owners must also engage a licensed agent at a cost of about $200 per clearance, unless they furnish a bank bond of $5,000 to ICA to act as their own agent. As a result, a single outbound clearance costs about $500, and a simple weekend round trip to nearby destinations such as Batam or Bintan can cost up to $1,000 in clearance fees. This is prohibitively expensive. Countries such as Indonesia and Thailand allow pleasure craft owners to complete CIQ procedures themselves, without engaging agents or renting private marina facilities, at costs amounting to only tens of Singapore dollars. While ICA can conduct CIQ procedures at Marina South Pier (MSP), MPA does not permit pleasure craft to berth there for CIQ purposes, even though cruise ships are allowed to do so. Instead, pleasure craft owners who want to save on marina CIQ charges are required to charter water launches from private marinas to MSP, adding several hundred dollars to the process and nullifying the intended savings. I suggest MPA consider allowing pleasure craft to berth at MSP for CIQ purposes, and that ICA let pleasure craft owners submit CIQ documentation directly without requiring a large bank bond. This would remove the need for costly third-party agents and marina fees. Such changes would promote maritime tourism and benefit Singapore pleasure craft owners as well as visiting boats, and would bring Singapores CIQ practices in line with those of most other maritime nations.

Fernandez from AWARE for raising the important issue of access to the employment dispute resolution process at the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) (Taking employers to task for discrimination: How easy is the legal process?, Dec 29). Transient Workers Count Too has, over the years, assisted many low-wage migrant workers throughout the ECT process –from initial filing to final resolution – pursuing salary and wrongful dismissal claims. As the article notes, the ECT process can be complex and intimidating, especially for migrant workers who lack community support or face language and cultural barriers. We also wish to highlight the increasing length of the ECT process. In early 2024, the typical interval between claim registration and the first case management conference was about three weeks. In 2025, this doubled to six weeks. We have also seen hearings involving Burmese-speaking employees postponed by a month due to interpreter shortages. These delays prolong stress and defer resolution, often worsening employees financial and emotional hardship. We hope the relevant authorities give due attention to these resourcing and scheduling challenges so the ECT process remains timely, accessible and fair, particularly for those already structurally disadvantaged. We also support the articles call to broaden support for employees navigating the ECT process in anticipation of its jurisdiction expansion under the Workplace Fairness Act and the Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Act, highlighting where the ECT and the authorities can improve accessibility and address power imbalances. One practical example is the Community Courts and Tribunals (CCT) Friend Scheme. With tribunal approval, an employee may be accompanied by a CCT Friend who provides emotional and administrative support. Most employees are unaware of this option until we advise them. While CCT Friends cannot advocate for employees, they help explain instructions, take notes and locate documents. Our experience shows that this support empowers employees to participate fully in the process, leading to more equitable outcomes. We support efforts to encourage more organisations to provide such assistance on a pro bono basis, and strongly urge that vulnerable employees be referred to appropriate organisations early in the process.

Start-ups have for a while tried to beef up headphones beyond their basic functions, like listening to music and making phone calls. Nearly a decade ago, tech start-ups Waverly Labs and Mymanu added real-time translation to that list, and Google quickly followed suit, creating a voice-activated AI assistant in 2020. Riding the AI wave, other tech industry leaders Samsung and Apple have also entered the fray, with noise cancellation now almost a product standard. Start-ups, many of which are attending this weeks CES consumer electronics extravaganza in Las Vegas, are now trying to refine this technology and apply it to specific uses. Such is the case with OSO, which wants to take the concept of a professional assistant further. Its earbuds will record meetings and retrieve conversation elements on demand using everyday language. Viaim, a competitor, offers similar services and intends to focus on interoperability in a world controlled by major smartphone manufacturers that impose their own platforms. If you use a different brand of cell phone, it doesnt have any AI functions at all. Thats the opportunity for our earbuds, explained Mr Shawn Ma, CEO of Viaim, whose devices are compatible with all brands, including iPhones in China. Timekettle, meanwhile, is enjoying success in a completely different context, with 90 per cent of its sales coming from schools, according to Mr Brian Shircliffe, head of US sales for the Chinese company. Many schools equip their non-English-speaking students with the devices so they can follow lessons without the need for a translator. As for whether earbuds can replace smart glasses, connected speakers or even smartphones as the dominant physical extension of generative AI, remains unanswered. For now, any AI functionality is really dependent on the phone that its connected to, said Mr Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. Earbuds are certainly a more accessible entry for AI than smart glasses, said Mr Avi Greengart, president of Techsponential, a consultancy. Theyre a lot less expensive, theyre a product most smartphone users are buying anyway, and they dont require a prescription. However, people generally dont wear them all the time, unlike glasses, and they can only interact with voice, so youll need to be in an environment where talking is acceptable, the analyst cautioned, adding that the lack of a camera limits the devices potential. Some wont be constrained by the shortcoming, notably Naqi Logix, whose Neural Earbuds are equipped with ultra-sensitive sensors that detect tiny movements. Thanks to these sensors, a quadriplegic user can control their wheelchair or surf the internet simply by looking at their computer screen. Operations manager Sandeep Arya sees great potential for these innovations, because people would like to be able to interact with their environment in a more discreet, subtle way, without having to call out to Siri on their smartphone, Alexa on their speaker or Meta on their glasses. Mr Arya envisions the technology going further, thanks to improved sensors capable of deciphering facial movements that a chatbot can use to find the right tone and words according to mood. Neurable, another start-up whose MW75 Neuro LT headset measures brain activity, dreams of using its equipment to enable communication through thought, without gestures or words. Its remarkable, says Mr Wood of these breakthroughs, but its still a niche market for now. Until further notice, the hundreds of millions of headphones that have been sold will remain focused on listening.

For a more affordable option, head to Zheng Shi Shang Hunan Cuisine, a foodcourt stall at Food Republic. Located at 313@somerset, the stall offers a home-style version of the bold, chilli-forward flavours of Hunan cooking, served in a mix-and-match format akin to economy rice, but cooked in small batches and served in individual bowls. Opened on Nov 29, the stall specialises in xiao wan cai, or small dishes plated individually and usually eaten with rice. Dishes are placed in heated display cases, keeping turnover brisk and flavours fresh. Sets start at $6.80 for one meat and one vegetable, scaling up to $9.70 for two meats and one vegetable, and $15.50 for three meats and two vegetables. Each set comes with a choice of refillable short-grain rice, pumpkin porridge made with millet and pumpkin, or lightly sweetened snow fungus dessert. For a la carte orders, these items are priced at $1 each and refillable at no extra charge. Owner Zhang Yu, 39, who hails from Hubei, spent her 20s working at her familys restaurants in Hunan. She came to Singapore in 2021. The mother of two opened the stall to provide diners healthier home-style meals which are not heavily seasoned. She packs takeaway meals from her stall for her 15-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter at least thrice a week. The stall offers a choice of 26 items. Among the most popular is the Pepper Salt Potato Slices ($2.90). Criss-cut and fried, the potatoes are crisp on the outside and fluffy within, lifted by chopped garlic, red chilli padi and green pepper with a restrained hand on salt. To keep it at its best, the dish is usually available only during the lunch peak between 11.30am and 12.30pm. The stalls signature dish is Maos Braised Pork Belly ($4.90). Cubes of fresh pork belly are braised daily with Chinese soya sauce and whole spices such as star anise, cinnamon and cloves. The skin and fat turn softly gelatinous, the meat remains firm and the dish carries a gentle sweetness without tipping into cloying richness. Quail eggs and broccoli help cut through the heft. Another reliable choice is the Stir-fried Pork Belly with Beancurd Stick and Black Fungus ($3.90). The pork belly is first fried to release flavour, then tossed with dried red chillies, woodear mushroom and beancurd sticks that soak up sauce. Vegetable dishes are treated with the same care. The Stir-fried Lotus Pond ($2.90) delivers a clean crunch from lotus root, snow peas, carrot and woodear mushroom. The Cold Okra Salad ($1.90) is excellent – lightly blanched okra, cool and snappy, dressed in a subtly sweet soya-based sauce with no raw edge.

Escape From The Outland blends hostage drama with uneven anti-war message,"Jan 07, 2026, 11:30 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 11:30 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e3af9f10c92be20c17aa5319c7eb2d0daab79233ff8a834059a9486992144663,"Simon Yam (foreground, left), Xiao Yang (foreground, second from left) and Qi Xi (background, right) in Escape From The Outland.PHOTO: SHAW ORGANISATION","['At The Movies', 'Movies', 'Movie review']","The story:In a fictitious African nation torn by civil war, Chinese journalist Ma Xiao (Xiao Yang) and telecom engineer Miao Feng (Zheng Kai) travel to a danger zone so Miao Feng can repair a cell tower. They are captured by rebels. At a separate ambush, they also capture Ma Xiaos physician wife Wenjia (Qi Xi), a member of a medical mission. While Chinese embassy staff conduct ransom negotiations and a possible rescue, the hostages are under daily threat of torture, execution or maiming. Interesting in some places but frustratingly shallow in others, Escape From The Outland takes a new spin on the concept of the hostage drama, too long the domain of storytellers who frame them as action or espionage thrillers. In slick productions like South Koreas The Point Men (2023), the focus is on the investigative procedural, followed by the bullet storm that marks the rescue. There are some pyrotechnics here, mainly at its climax. But that slice-of-action cinema comes after a first and middle section that puts Ma Xiaos ordeal in the spotlight, illustrating the storys anti-war message. As more than one character puts it, in war, the real winners are the flies – they get the corpses. According to Escape From The Outlands producers, the film is inspired by eyewitness accounts of Chinese nationals kidnapped in war-torn regions. Director and co-writer Shen Ao (Dead To Rights, 2025; No More Bets, 2023) presents Ma Xiao as a news videographer who views the suffering around him only as content. After all, he is a foreigner who can easily fly home. Post-kidnapping, he gets an awakening because he sees up close the indiscriminate effects of landmines, and the way villagers are crushed between the warlords and government forces. Hong Kong star Simon Yam has a supporting role as a cynical weapons merchant. His character exposes the moral contrast between the virtuous Chinese, in Africa to do good, and Chinese profiteers. The film makes clear which side it supports through scenes so didactic, they induce second-hand embarrassment. By its middle section, the movie settles down into a prison survival story, well illustrated with horrific scenes of executions, torture and maiming, appropriate for a movie about wartime inhumanity. Strong performances from Yam, Xiao Yang and Qi Xi add depth and underscore the pacifist message, which the film nevertheless contradicts frequently through spectacular action sequences showing bad guys receiving gory retribution. Hot take:Although marred by unsubtle preachiness about Chinas mission to build roads and cell towers in Africa, it offers a fast-paced, unflinching look at the horrors awaiting civilians and foreigners held for ransom by warlords.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/escape-from-the-outland-blends-hostage-drama-with-uneven-anti-war-message

Within six years, half the colony would be either missing or dead in a shocking unsolved mystery. Hollywood director Ron Howard earned Academy Award notices for memorialising the lunar mission of Apollo 13 (1995) and a mathematical genius in A Beautiful Mind (2001). There is nothing heroic in his latest true story, based on two survivors conflicting accounts of the Galapagos Affair. Jude Law stars in Eden as German physician-philosopher Friedrich Ritter, the pioneer along with his ailing lover Dore (Vanessa Kirby). A pompous hypocrite, he renounces humanity, yet sends his manifestos to the continent for publication. His celebrity attracts the arrival of an earnest couple, Heinz (Daniel Bruhl) and Margret Wittmer (Sydney Sweeney), and their son (Jonathan Tittel). He resents the intrusion. And then a self-styled baroness (Ana de Armas) slithers ashore, a cunning black-hearted viper in their illusory Eden. A deadly power struggle breaks out over the depleting resources and the camps competing utopian ideologies: solitude for Friedrich, family for the Wittmers, and noisy all-hours sex with her pair of boy toys (Felix Kammerer and Toby Wallace) for the baroness, who has delusions of building a luxury resort. The characters are varying degrees of unlikeable in a sensationalistic, borderline campy parable on civilisations collapse. But it is irresistible, watching the members of the starry ensemble destroy one another in a tropical climate sticky with insects, exaggerated accents, mistrust and greed. Law goes full-frontal, and Sweeneys hausfrau Margret goes into labour while attacked by a pack of wild dogs. Hot take:The Survivor reality series has never been so luridly entertaining. 116 minutes, available on Netflix★★☆☆☆ The story:British actress Kate Winslet produces and turns director with a holiday weepie about a quartet of squabbling adult siblings brought together by a domestic crisis. Goodbye June was written by Winslets 22-year-old son Joe Anders. Her directing debut is a family affair both behind the camera and on-screen, where the Oscar-winning star has cast herself as the capable middle daughter, a busy working mum with AirPods in her ears. Andrea Riseborough plays her jealous estranged younger sister, a high-strung homemaker who eats organic. Toni Collette gets the kooky role of the New Ager eldest sister spreading her healing energy. There is also a sensitive younger brother (Johnny Flynn). Starring as the eponymous matriarch is Helen Mirren, and her four children have converged in her London hospital room over the two weeks before Christmas for her dying days. Junes cancer has metastasised, setting off among them a tempest of anguish, acrimony, age-old tensions and grief. Viewers may, meanwhile, be mourning instead the collection of top-tier actors in such treacle. Winslet has a steady directorial hand, and English national treasure Timothy Spall is tragicomic as the incompetent father numbing his feelings at the neighbourhood pub. The characters are, nevertheless, broad types, even Mirrens suffering yet stoic mother, and none more so than the angelic nurse named Angel (Fisayo Akinade). Dispensing morphine and knowing smiles, he becomes Junes co-conspirator in a ploy to reconcile her dysfunctional clan. That is Junes parting gift. And, sure enough, there will be comforting hugs in a sincere but shallow tearjerker on how the shared loss of a loved one can unite and heal. Hot take:The sterling ensemble renders watchable a middling melodrama that is far beneath what its members are capable of.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/eden-is-luridly-entertaining-goodbye-june-a-middling-melodrama

Taylors endorsement prompts Swift sell-out for Sancerre wine,"Jan 06, 2026, 09:00 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 10:36 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/77c63181b68d22bbd1161b1c0ef1184259b2a8cefc9ffd980a0e9615448faa3f,"Taylor Swift is known to be a wine fan, referencing the drink frequently in her lyrics and in photos posted to social media.PHOTO: SCREENGRAB FROM TAYLOR SWIFT/INSTAGRAM","['Taylor Swift', 'Wine', 'France', 'Documentaries', 'Streaming - music/video/content']","PARIS – A French winemaker has hailed the impact of his Sancerre appearing in Taylor Swifts latest documentary series, which looks set to deepen Americas love affair with the famed Loire appellation. A bottle of Sancerre by the Terres Blanches domaine, which sells for around US$40 (S$51) in the United States, is seen briefly by a mixing desk during Episode 5 of Taylor Swift: The End Of An Era (2025) on Disney+. That was enough for the army of online Swifties, who scrutinise the American singers every move, to identify Taylors wine. Stock quickly sold out on the website of its US distributor, providing the latest example ofwhat has become known as Swiftonomics– the ability of the 36-year-old billionaire to make or break brands with an endorsement. It is pretty mad. You cannot put a price on it, Mr Laurent Saget, who runs Terres Blanches, told AFP. Even if we had wanted to place one of our bottles in such a widely watched series, we could not have afforded it. It is nice to have a spotlight land on the appellation and on our domaine, he added. Mr Saget, 40, said he did not know Swifts music, but he would be happy to welcome the soon-to-be-married megastar to the small family-owned property in the village of Bue, which produces 80,000 to 120,000 bottles a year. Swift is known to be a wine fan, referencing the drink frequently in her lyrics as well as in photos posted to social media. When asked in 2018 by American talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres what she would bring to a dinner party, she showed no hesitation in replying white wine, before adding her preferences: Sancerre, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc. Sancerre is one of Frances most famous wine-making regions, located in the central Loire Valley, where its famously crisp whites are produced from 100 per cent Sauvignon Blanc and its reds with Pinot Noir. It has steadily built a following in the US, earning a reputation as a quintessential quality French white alongside others from Burgundy. Its popularity abroad means that around two out of three bottles of white Sancerre produced each year are exported, with about half crossing the Atlantic to the US, according to industry figures. New tariffs of 15 per cent imposed on French wine by US President Donald Trump are not expected to hit demand, said Mr Saget. Despite the tariffs, and perhaps not everyone would say the same way, but I do not think there has been a major impact on our appellation, he said, adding that Sancerre was positioned as a pricey but still accessible product. Other famous Sancerre fans include American basketball star LeBron James and Spanish singer Rosalia. Its fortunes differ sharply with Frances wine industry as a whole, which is struggling with overproduction, fierce competition internationally and declining domestic consumption. Even in some of the best-known regions such as Bordeaux, low-end producers are ripping up vines to plant other crops, including olives.

In a video uploaded to Instagram on Jan 2, the 46-year-old said: Its late on Jan 1. The first day of 2026. And Im entering this new year, the Year of the Horse, with some bad news about my concussion. The actress, who played superhero scientist Hope van Dyne/Wasp in the Ant-Man superhero film trilogy (2015 to 2023) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), said she received results back from her brain scans and almost every area in my brain is functioning at a decreased capacity. So, I do have brain damage from the TBI (traumatic brain injury), and possibly other factors going on, she added. Now, my job is to get to the bottom of that with the doctors and then embark on the hard work of fixing it, which I dont look forward to because I feel like hard work is all I do. But thats okay. My cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finish to my 2025. Feeling extraordinarily grateful and blessed to be able to play one more day, one more year on this beautiful living planet, she said, before thanking her followers for caring. Lilly, who has two children aged 14 and 10 with her production-assistant partner Norman Kali, first revealed her injury in a blog post on digital publishing platform Substack in May 2025. Posting photos of her bloodied face, she explained how she had experienced fainting spells since she was a child, with doctors initially believing it was due to hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, which was later ruled out. The star, who is also known for her roles in TV series Lost (2004 to 2010) and The Hobbit films (2013 to 2014), updated in an Instagram post in June 2025 that her concussion had taken a downturn. Several of Lillys celebrity friends, including her Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania (2023) co-star Michelle Pfeiffer, commented on Lillys recent Instagram post. You are a warrior. Nothing – not even this will defeat you my friend, wrote the 67-year-old American actress, adding a heart emoji.

BMW slashed its official price guide last week on 31 models sold in China, with reductions of as much as 301,000 yuan (S$55,200) on its flagship pure-electric i7 M70L model. The German automakers steepest cut outlined was for its iX1 eDrive25L, which saw a 24 per cent drop to 228,000 yuan. The German luxury automaker said the adjustment was part of its regular price management, according to a statement on Jan 7. Final transaction prices are independently negotiated and determined between authorized BMW dealers and customers, it added. Dealers for brands under the joint ventures with Volkswagen and General Motors have also rolled out renewed discounts and fixed-price offers on select models in the first week of 2026, according to local media reports, signalling that renewed competitive pressure is spreading beyond premium brands. While car buyers in the United States face an industry-wide affordability crisis as prices remain stubbornly high, China has the opposite problem: Prices for new cars keep falling as automakers compete to clear out inventory in a sluggish market. In December, the China Passenger Car Association said sales contracted in November for a second month in a row. Thats left automakers with little choice but to sweeten deals, even at the risk of regulatory scrutiny. Chinas State Administration for Market Regulation in December unveiled draft guidelines aimed at curbing price cuts, including prohibitions on selling vehicles below production cost and banning dealer rebates that effectively push prices under cost. Beijing is worried a deflationary spiral could damage the countrys supply-chain by forcing auto parts makers to switch to cheaper, lower quality components and also hold down wages for workers. But carmakers have bucked that initiative as they struggle with overcapacity. And the latest wave of discounting indicates that is unlikely to change in the new year. For one thing, analysts suggest the industry has technically avoided selling for less than it costs them to make a vehicle – something that Beijing policymakers consider a red line. The price adjustments from BMW and some other brands are more about aligning recommended pricing to be closer to the final transaction price, which can be much lower after rounds of haggling at showrooms. The new prices arent lower than the actual transaction price at the dealer level last year, so that doesnt count as a price war, said Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight. In principle, BMWs price cut helps alleviate pressure on dealers resorting to further negotiation at the retail level, said Li Yanwei, an advisor to the China Automobile Dealers Association. But its unclear how persuasive that logic will be when car buyers seek to drive a hard bargain in showrooms and dealers are anxious to move vehicles off their lots. Mr Li added that automakers looking to meet their first quarter sales targets by March are expected to launch even more discounts, particularly in the run-up to Chinese New Year in February. Rather than outright price cuts, some manufacturers are leaning on financial incentives and value-added perks. Tesla on Jan 6 rolled out a seven-year low-interest financing plan, along with a five-year zero-interest option. Xiaomi has offered a three-year interest-free loan for its YU7 SUV, as well as various feature add-ons to its SU7 Ultra variant, including carbon-fiber upgrades. Similarly, Chery Automobile and other carmakers are offering factory-backed trade-in subsidies to spur demand, as authorities have updated the conditions in a way that limits the amount of national subsidies being handed out via a government cash-for-clunkers programme. While the timing may be linked to pre-Chinese New Year promotions, the scale and breadth of these incentives point to deeper structural pressures, with at least 14 car brands having launched some form of discount or incentive since the start of 2026, according to Chinese media reports. Various kinds of promotional activities may ebb and flow in the market from time to time, but they are here to stay, said Automotive Foresights Mr Zhang.

Shares of DBS, South-east Asias largest bank by assets, crossed $58 for the first time in morning trade, reaching as high as $58.80. The stock then pared gains to $58.35 at the midday trading break, 0.7 per cent higher than its record close of $57.93 on Jan 6. OCBC hit as high as $20.25 on Jan 7, after crossing $20 for the first time a day earlier. At midday break, it was down 0.7 per cent at $20.04. UOB shares rose 0.6 per cent to $36.14 before paring gains to $35.94, up 0.3 per cent from the previous days close. While the counter has gained in weeks-long bank share rally, it has not come close to its all-time closing high of $38.67 in March 2025. The local banks – which are heavyweights of the STI – have pushed the market benchmark to a historic high of 4,765.29 on Jan 7. As at 11.21am, the index was 0.1 per cent lower at 4,740.08. DBS shares have gained more than 30 per cent in the past 12 months, while OCBC is up about 19 per cent. UOB, whose third-quarter profit tumbled 72 per cent as it hiked allowances by $1 billion, is down more than 3 per cent in the same period. Morningstar director of Asia equity research Lorraine Tan said that with interest rates expected to fall, quality companies with attractive dividend yields are being seen as a proxy to holding Singapore government bonds. While we think that the current share prices of DBS and OCBC are quite rich on an intrinsic valuation basis, we cant deny that their dividend yields, which are around 5 per cent, are attractive presently, said Ms Tan, adding that both banks have room to continue share buybacks although dividend payouts may stay at the current level. This still should lead to dividend growth as long as earnings are stable. However, we feel that on a risk-reward basis, UOB is slightly more attractive at this stage, she added. According to a DBS Group Research report on Dec 9, Singapores banking sector remains supported by robust tailwinds, specifically excess capital and attractive dividend yields of up to 6 per cent. DBS dividend yield is forecast to be at 6.1 per cent in 2026, while those for OCBC and UOB are at 5.4 per cent each, estimates DBS Group Research. Analysts told The Straits Times that DBS offers the most attractive dividend yields among the local banks, as it looks to increase quarterly dividends by 6 cents to 66 cents in 2026. There is also an additional 15 cents per share to be paid in capital return dividend, which has been committed up to financial year 2027, making up a total of 81 cents per quarter. DBS also retained its position asSingapores leading investment bank in 2025, generating US$72.9 million in fees to capture an 8.4 per cent market share of the total fee pool. Net interest margins (NIM) for the local banks are expected to remain under pressure in 2026, with DBS better hedged than OCBC and UOB with unexpired hedges and strength in deposit growth, the analysts said.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/dbs-ocbc-shares-extend-record-breaking-rally

The South Korean company is the worlds largest memory-chip maker, but even its portfolio is not immune to the surging cost of the component essential to everything from smartphones and laptops to connected home appliances and self-driving cars. Theres going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and its going to affect everyone, Mr Lee Wonjin, president and head of global marketing, said in an interview. Prices are going up even as we speak. Obviously, we dont want to convey that burden to the consumers, but were going to be at a point where we have to actually consider repricing our products. Mr Lee spoke from the CES 2026 tech show in Las Vegas, where Samsung is showing off its vast range of electronic products, from tiny wireless earbuds to 130-inch wall-dominating TVs. Like most consumer-facing brands at the show, Samsung is pitching its vision of a more interconnected, AI-enhanced line-up of products – and confronting the rising cost of production. The AI data centre buildout boom has brought about unprecedented demand for high-bandwidth memory, a lucrative product that has lifted Samsung and fellow memory maker SK Hynixs stock prices to new highs and constrained supply lines for other uses. Major brands, including Dell Technologies and Xiaomi, have warned about potential price increases, while others, including Lenovo Group, in 2025 began stockpiling memory chips in anticipation. Counterpoint Research in November forecast a 50 per cent price rise for memory modules through the second quarter of this year. Samsung is better positioned than competitors who arent able to manufacture memory for their own products, and Mr Lee sees the company outpacing the broader market. Were more optimistic about the outlook of 2026 than what we have experienced in 2025, he said. Mobile phones, with the emergence of AI, I think people are looking at upgrading their products to be able to leverage the new technologies.

India exporters risk losing US orders without January trade deal,"Jan 07, 2026, 09:56 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 11:17 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/42d949e2ffdce7a3153527eef45f82eebc2aeb4107770f32b3e02c9aea2301e4,"Garment workers stitch shirts at a textile factory in Hindupur town in Andhra Pradesh, India.PHOTO: REUTERS","['India', 'Tariffs', 'Trade']","MUMBAI- Indian exporters of products ranging from home decor to leather shoes are worried about missing the US summer shopping season if they are unable to lock in orders in January as trade-deal talks drag on between New Delhi and Washington. This will be the decisive month for sealing the trade pact so contracts can be secured for the first half of 2026, according to half a dozen local exporters who spoke to Bloomberg News. The punitive 50 per cent US tariffs since August already hurt the exporters order volumes in the typically busy winter and Christmas season in 2025. One of the steepest levies imposed by the Trump administration continue to deal a heavy blow to Indias labour-intensive sectors, especially textiles, handicrafts, apparels, gems and leather. Despite multiple rounds of talks, including four conversations between US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi since August, the slow progress in the trade deal has pressured the rupee and forced New Delhi to dole out US$5 billion (S$6.4 billion) to protect Indian exporters. Mr Rafeeque Ahmed, chairman of Farida Group, which is one of the largest shoemakers in India, said that Jan 15 is the cut-off date for securing bulk orders from the US to ensure stable revenue for the summer and autumn seasons. The company derives about 60 per cent of its export revenue from American markets. I have cut down production by 20 per cent to 25 per cent and laid off workers, said Mr Ahmed, who supplies to international brands like Cole Haan and Clarks. How long can we sustain this and keep giving discounts? Mr Trump, meanwhile continues to send mixed signals. He told reporters on Jan 4 that high tariffs had pushed New Delhi to reduce Russian oil imports. Mr Trump added that Mr Modi knew he was not happy, and because India trades with the US, we can raise tariffs on them very quickly, and it would be very bad for them – remarks that raised doubts about whether he intends to remain combative toward India or move to expedite a trade deal. Indias oil imports from Russia in December fell 40 per cent from a June peak of 2.1 million barrels a day, a noticeable gain for Mr Trump, who has intensified efforts to choke off cash flows to Russian President Vladimir Putins war machine and end the Ukraine conflict. In 2024, before trade headwinds darkened sentiment, India shipped goods worth US$87.4 billion to the US, accounting for almost one-fifth of the countrys total exports. US government trade data show apparel imports dropped by about 12 per cent to US$376 million in September 2025 compared with the year-ago period. Imports of rugs fell by 10 per cent to US$98.4 million over the same period. If the deal doesnt happen quickly then April-August and holiday shipping would be impacted, said Mr Gautam Nair, director of apparel maker Matrix Design. First half would then be a complete washout. As part of efforts to diversify its markets beyond the US, India in recent months has forged new free trade alliances with New Zealand, Oman and Britain. Negotiations with the EU, Australia, Chile and Peru are ongoing. To offset losses, many exporters are also scrambling to salvage supplier relationships by offering discounts or traveling abroad to secure new clients and reassure existing ones. Mr Lalit Thukral, founder of textile exporter Twenty Second Miles, said August through December is typically the busiest period for the industry, but this year it delivered losses instead. Preparing for tougher days ahead, he travelled to Britain with a 15-person delegation in November, looking for new customers. Mr R.K. Sivasubramaniam, whose company makes basics like underwear, will visit the US in January to scout for buyers. He has cut his production since August by 50 per cent. We are trying to get newer buyers but it is not possible to grab them immediately, he said, adding that this work trip was crucial for his business. Other US buyers are indefinitely gone. Mr Vijay Sethi, a director at Sethi Handicrafts, has lost several US clients despite offering discounts as much as 20 per cent. The maker of home decor products, based in a town just outside of New Delhi, has meetings with US buyers lined up in January. Several gems and jewelry exporters are experimenting with costly workarounds to blunt the impact of the tariff. Some have set up US subsidiaries to manage trade locally, while others are shifting parts of their manufacturing to countries like the United Arab Emirates, where duties are about 15 per cent, said Mr Sabyasachi Ray, executive director of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council. Theyve had to change the way of doing business, said Mr Ray. But the workarounds have taken a toll. Apparel suppliers such as Raymond Lifestyle and Gokaldas Exports, were among the firms considering moving some of their production to African countries. Gokaldas has four factories in Kenya and one in Ethiopia, while Raymond was looking to use its Ethiopia plant to supply American buyers, as tariffs in these countries are as low as 10 per cent. Exporters dont have much choice right now, said Dr Ajay Sahai, director general of Federation of Indian Export Organizations. They are looking at alternative markets, selling locally, and one thing has become very clear – we cant overly depend on the US for exports.

"Wee Hur, partners break ground on Wycombe Abbey international school project in Hougang","Jan 07, 2026, 09:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 10:07 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f5fb2aaf6f1d4523e59c6c8a0b2fdd8ba203bc0a9b2b1910993a1842a2d369db,"Chief investment officer Goh Wee Ping said Wee Hurs recent moves, such as developing the Wycombe Abbey school and acquiring Hotel Miramar – reflect a deliberate strategy to expand its repertoire.PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO","['Singapore companies', 'Private school', 'Singapore property', 'The Business Times']","SINGAPORE - Property group Wee Hur is gearing up for a year of execution as it builds a pipeline of new projects, starting with the Wycombe Abbey School (Singapore) in Hougang Avenue 3. At the ground-breaking ceremony for the school on Jan 6, chief investment officer Goh Wee Ping said the project marked a significant milestone for the group, after more than 20 years in the education-related space. In 2004, Wee Hur built key amenities such as swimming pools, a sports field and basement halls for United World College in Dover Road. In 2022, the group erected a new 11-storey block with sports and recreational facilities at Tanglin Trust School. Wycombe Abbey School (Singapore) represents its latest step in the space,developed with joint venture partners Wycombe Abbey and BE Education. The project is part of Wycombe Abbey International Schools broader expansion in Asia, with campuses in mainland China and Hong Kong. Mr William Vanbergen, founder and chairman of BE Education, said the school aims to provide world-class education to thousands of students in Singapore over the coming decades. We want to be welcoming parents from all over the world, helping to attract top talent here to Singapore to help improve the whole economy, he said. The international school is among several projects announced by Wee Hur in 2025. These include the launch of its third fund, the single-asset WHF3A, which was set up for a new purpose-built student accommodation development in Grenfell Street in Adelaide, Australia. The fund has a committed capital of A$57 million (S$49 million) – of which at least A$12.6 million is from Wee Hur, as the sponsor; A$21.1 million is from the Goh directors; and up to A$23.3 million is from independent and unrelated investors such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals. Many were existing partners or repeat investors familiar with the groups track record and management team, Mr Goh told The Business Times. This third fund was raised relatively quickly, as much of the groundwork was already complete – the land had been approved for student housing, a builder appointed, and bank financing secured, said Mr Goh, who is also chief executive officer of Wee Hurs fund management arm, Wee Hur Capital. This shortened investors capital commitment to about two years, compared with closer to four years for earlier-stage developments. Were quite comfortable with the approach that we have, (where) we warehouse the land, we de-risk it, fundraise, and then we keep rinsing and repeating, said Mr Goh. This is a tested and proven flavour. For these projects, the group typically targets mid- to high-teens internal rates of return to reflect greenfield risk. Besides the current slate, he said the group has two other assets in the pipeline and aims to eventually manage four to five assets. It favours cities such as Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, where Mr Goh said the group has built strong capabilities and will continue to double down. Meanwhile, it is steering clear of Melbourne, citing foreign investor constraints, supply-demand concerns and construction costs. Asked whether a listed real estate investment trust (REIT) could be on the cards, Mr Goh said that was not a fixed goal, though it could be considered, especially since Wee Hur has gone through a decade-long phase of building capabilities. But for a listing to make sense, the group would need the right mix of assets and a sizable portfolio, alongside favourable regulatory and market conditions, including the pricing and returns investors expect from comparable REITs, said Mr Goh. On the home front, he said Wee Hurs recent moves – from developing the Wycombe Abbey school, partnering an Aravest fund toacquire Hotel Miramar for $160 million, to clinching an Upper Thomson government land sales site – reflect a deliberate strategy to expand its repertoire. He highlighted that the group intends to broaden its activities, pursuing projects opportunistically, while staying grounded in real estate. If a project is not in our circle of competence… we always have a partner, he said, citing Wee Hurs joint venture for Wycombe Abbey School (Singapore) and its partnership with local asset manager Aravest in acquiring Hotel Miramar Singapore,which they will rebrand as a Doubletree Hilton. At the same time, the group has clear limits on what it will not do, he said – such as data centres, which require large investments and are dominated by big players, as well as certain geographies such as Vietnam and India. While it stepped up deployment last year, Mr Goh said: I will say 2026 is a time for us to slow down, focus on execution, and then start building up more pipeline for next year. Some of the seeds that we sowed a few years back are starting to come to fruition. This year will be a little bit of harvesting, all the way to 2027.

Nvidia says its revenue forecast has grown more bullish,"Jan 07, 2026, 08:28 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 10:35 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e0d19d1a8fa98322221db054980bf7136cbfb1e819dc6f4512ca6bdd223fa64f,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking at the CES 2026 show on Jan 6.PHOTO: AFP,"['Nvidia', 'Semiconductors', 'AI/artificial intelligence']","SAN FRANCISCO- Nvidia, countering fears about an artificial intelligence (AI) spending bubble, said that an upbeat revenue forecast delivered in October has grown brighter due to strong demand. Large customer deals – and increasing uptake of new AI models – have brought in more orders than anticipated, the company said during presentations on Jan 7 at the CES 2026 show in Las Vegas. In October, Nvidia had projected about half a trillion dollars of revenue from current and future data centre chips by the end of 2026. Though the company didnt provide a new figure, it suggested that revenue in that time frame would eclipse the US$500 billion (S$640 billion) level. We should have a very good year, chief executive Jensen Huang said during a press conference. Deals with companies such as AI provider Anthropic, as well as improving prospects in China, should increase our expectations of that number. Nvidias outlook is crucial to allaying investor concerns about the AI industry. The company, which supplies the chips that power AI models, has maintained that customer spending will stay strong because the benefits are so large. For calendar 2026, Wall Street currently projects Nvidia will have total revenue of US$321.2 billion, an increase of 57 per cent. For 2027, they estimate the company will end the year with more than US$400 billion in sales. In separate remarks at a JPMorgan Chase event, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said that corporate data processing needs – rather than just AI – are also fuelling demand for next-generation computing. That will help overall investments reach multiple trillions by the end of the decade. That US$500 billion has definitely gotten larger, she said. Still, the remarks failed to impress investors. Nvidia shares fell 0.4 per cent to US$187.28 at the close in New York. They had gained 39 per cent in 2025. A key question is whether Nvidia can get back into the booming market for AI chips in China. US export restrictions have hobbled its business in that region, but the Trump administration has said that Nvidia can start selling its H200 chip to customers in the country. The customer demand is high, quite high, very high, Mr Huang said. Weve fired up our supply chain. H200s are flowing through the line. Mr Huang said the last details of licences from the US government are being finalised, and he does not expect any formal declaration of approval from Beijing. Chinese government sign-off will come in the form of allowing companies there to submit orders, he said. The previous day, Nvidia provided details about new chips that will go on sale in the second half of the year. Mr Huang also touted the power efficiency of the processors, which can deliver increased performance without requiring new computers to house them. His comments about cooling systems, meanwhile, caused ripples on Wall Street. Mr Huang said that racks of the new Rubin chips can be cooled with water that does not require a chiller. Shares of the companies that make cooling technology, such as Johnson Controls International, tumbled on Jan 6. Energy use has been another concern for the AI industry. Mr Huang dismissed fears about running out of power to feed data centres, calling shortages a normal consequence of industrial revolutions. He called for work on investing in all types of new power generation. BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/nvidia-says-its-revenue-forecast-has-only-grown-more-bullish

At least 11 ships chartered by the US oil major are scheduled to arrive in the Venezuelan government-controlled ports of Jose and Bajo Grande in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The data, which is preliminary, compares with nine vessels in December and is the highest since October, when 12 tankers loaded. The Houston-based company operates in Venezuela under a licence granted by the US Treasury Department and it is the only Western firm allowed to produce and export crude oil amid American sanctions. Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, it said in a statement on Jan 6. Chevron continues to load oil as at least 12 vessels bound for Venezuela turned away under the heavy US military presence in the Caribbean. Two tankers used in the transport of sanctioned oil were caught in the US naval blockade. The US is now chasing a third tanker known as Marinera, or Bella 1, CBS News reported. Some vessels of the dark fleet were able to safely leave Venezuela over the weekend, right after US forces captured Mr Maduro, according to TankerTrackers.com. At least four tankers, and maybe as many as 16, got through the blockade, it said, without providing the names of the vessels. Tankers of the shadow fleet typically turn off or spoof their transponders to disguise their location. Out of the 11 Chevron-chartered vessels headed to the South American nation, one has already loaded and two others are docked, according to vessel movements tracked by Bloomberg. All the oil goes to refineries in the US, including Valero Energy, Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum. US President Donald Trump is banking thatoil companies will step in with big investments to revive production in Venezuelaafter years of corruption and neglect ravaged output, though crude producers are likely to proceed cautiously. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright plans to talk this week with oil industry executives. Venezuelan oil exports – measured by ship loadings – fell to a 17-month low in December amid the naval blockade designed to clamp down on its illicit oil trade.

The stock is on a tear, leaping more than 40 per cent in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring roughly 1,050 per cent since hitting a low on April 22, 2025. It was the best performer in the S&P 500 Index on Jan 6, followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital and Seagate Technology Holdings, both of which are posting double-digit percentage gains. For storage, that is a completely unserved market today, Mr Huang said at CES on Jan 5. This is a market that never existed, and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the worlds AIs. Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence (AI) training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligences Jake Silverman. Mr Huangs comments at CES suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems, he said. Memory prices have been steadily climbing. Earlier this week, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60 per cent to 70 per cent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2025. Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as key beneficiaries of the push for AI inferencing and AI at the edge in 2026, Bank of America analysts led by Mr Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan 4. Mr Mohan expects organisations to retain increasing amounts of data for training, analytics and compliance purposes, with demand for storage skyrocketing in tandem. In particular, he cited growing use in drones, surveillance, vehicles and sports technology. The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models, that has created the next wave in hardware spending, Mr Mohan wrote. As we look at 2026 and beyond, we expect AI Inference to dominate. BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/sandisk-stocks-1000-rally-turbocharged-by-nvidia-ceos-remarks

"Farmer, plumber, lift technician: More young people in Singapore drawn to skilled trades","Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 09:26 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a1211d1fa461921890d74bb798a1f91bb6bf2ae5cfc09062f528fe7bf2b60b17,"(Clockwise from left) Farmer Daniel Yap, plumber Geraldine Goh and lift technician Muaaz Samat join a growing number of younger workers turning to traditional skilled trades.PHOTOS: DANIEL YAP, KONE, ARIFFIN JAMAR","['ST Headstart', 'Employment', 'Labour market', 'Labour issues', 'Singapore']","SINGAPORE – Growing up, Mr Daniel Yap, 32, had always wanted to be a musician, do research or follow his fathers path to becoming an engineer. He ended up studying materials science and engineering in university, but it was his side hustle – watering, growing and selling plants – that held the most attraction. It turned out to be the best thing he did despite growing opportunities in other fields, and Mr Yap kept at it. Today, he manages his farm, Noi Gardens, in Singapore full time, and recently expanded to Johor Bahru, developing operations there. He has about 18 employees in both places. Mr Yap is among a growing number of younger workers, especially millennials and Gen Zs, who not only find a hands-on career rewarding, but are also enticed by the tangible fruits that come from entrepreneurship. Observers told The Straits Times that the growing interest in traditional skilled trades such as landscaping and plumbing can be attributed to younger workers hoping to become their own boss one day, with some considering it at least a part-time career. Licensed plumber Geraldine Goh, 31, who started her own plumbing business, Agraffe, in 2017 after a stint as a facilities management officer at a town council, said she has noticed a shift where younger people are attempting to enter the industry. Mr Shameer Khan, 22, said he joined BCA Academys plumbing and pipe-fitting course to widen his skills and expand his interior renovation companys service offerings. I chose plumbing over carpentry due to its wide coverage, including sewage systems, fire protection and water installation. Another student from the course, Mr Yeo Kai Xun, 23, wanted to leverage his architecture knowledge but hoped to pursue his passion for fixing things by obtaining a plumbing licence, building a practical, hands-on career in the built environment sector. Ms Goh, who is also a certified trainer running the basic domestic plumbing course at property management company Exceltec, said she envisions herself sharing her work experience with her juniors. Many experienced plumbers with decades of hands-on knowledge are retiring. If younger people dont step in to learn these skills now, we risk losing critical troubleshooting expertise that cant be replaced overnight. While there are project plumbers whose services are focused on large commercial projects, she is more passionate about maintenance work in peoples homes, including HDB, condominium and landed properties. Diagnosing real causes of issues like recurring leaks, concealed pipe failures, choked pipelines or poor water pressure requires deep understanding. Its the passion for helping others and solving problems, and whether you have the heart to help people. Mr Yap said of his experience: It was like this farming life chose me instead. Managing the business got him hooked, as he learnt new things daily, travelled to places like Thailand, Malaysia, Holland, Australia and Taiwan, and was able to see how people run their farms and sell produce in their own unique ways. Its almost like finding out the very things that make people happy across the world. When I started, I had to do all the watering and growing myself, and after a while, I set up systems in place to grow the plants. I am still working on improving the technical aspects of it, said Mr Yap, whose business focuses on wholesale and e-commerce. While he started out selling a lot of adeniums, commonly known as desert roses, and fruit plants, he kept changing the plants he sells – from succulents to ferns, caudex, aroids, bonsai and others. Mr Yap now has the whole range, offers landscaping services, and he recently started growing grass. Industry experts said that, in addition to passion, creating and being good at something tangible has resonated with people aged 25 to 44, the range covering millennials and Gen Zs. Its craftsmanship with a visible payoff, said Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) Institute chief executive Dominic Ng. Carpentry and woodworking are no longer perceived strictly as legal trades, but have been rediscovered as creative, resilient and future-ready skills, he said. The Artisan Academy of SFIC Institute has seen a clear and growing uptick in course participation from workers up to 35 years old, with many not only signing up for basic skills, but also pursuing advanced competencies to strengthen their career prospects. SFIC Institute business development manager Raymond Tuan, who oversees the professional craftsman programme, said there are mainly two groups of people who join the 21-day full-time course or its part-time variation. In the first group are those who are keen on home improvement, such as wanting to fix or repair their own cabinets, and in the second are people below 40 years old who are hoping to enter the gig economy or become their own boss one day. Those in the second group typically have full-time jobs and take up the course part-time after work or on weekends. Architecture graduate Shannon Tan, 26, said she joined the programme as craftsmanship is a growing industry. Its never boring. Compared with an office job, it might be better for young people to work with their hands and be on their feet while they still can, and it also helps young designers be creative. Dr Natt Srinara, a lecturer and consultant at EHL Hospitality Business School, said young people in the hospitality sector are noticing real vacancies and clear entry points in hotels, restaurants and attractions, especially for roles such as guest relations, kitchen, housekeeping, events and maintenance. This means the local hospitality and tourism sectors are still hiring, while many white-collar sectors are talking about headcount freezes, he noted. Besides, these jobs feel more resilient against artificial intelligence than a generic office role. Theres pride in craft, at being good at something tangible, whether thats plating desserts or receiving compliments from a high-net-worth guest, said Dr Srinara. Social media has also made these jobs more visible and aspirational, he said. Baristas, pastry chefs and horticulturists are showing their work online, and that changes how young people see trades. SFIC Institutes Mr Ng agreed, saying that social platforms such as TikTok spotlight the maker culture, where woodcraft becomes both a passion and a marketable product or service, enabling freelancers and boutique studios to thrive. Mr Yap uses social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Xiaohongshu to generate content and create new business opportunities. My content moved from memes to educational, to humour to care tips, to farm tours and more. And it seems people get better opportunities these days. Meanwhile, the local workforce in the lift and escalator industry is becoming younger and better paid, with a roughly 21 per cent increase in workers aged up to 35 from 2023 to 2025, said a spokesperson for the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). Over the past two years, the median age of local workers has also fallen, from 46 to 40 years old. Mr Muaaz Samat, 25, joined lift and escalator company Kone as a maintenance technician overseeing equipment operations at a hospital because it offered the perfect combination of hands-on engineering and career growth opportunities. Many people assume my job is like being a car mechanic. Its actually far more dynamic. One moment Im checking ropes, the next Im diagnosing error codes or fixing doors – all to keep passengers moving safely every day, he said. Mr Samat added that working in a hospital makes the job especially meaningful, as he gets to see how essential lifts are for patients. Nurses rely on them to move people who often have no other way to get around. Its humbling, and it reminds me why reliability matters. I was hospitalised once, too, so I understand how vulnerable these moments can feel. In 2023, theNational Trades Union Congress called for skilled trades to be professionalised, and started working with the Ministry of Manpower to develop a Career Progression Model with specific career and accreditation pathways. It also released a study that aims to establish a strong local core of skilled tradespeople in Singapore. The study showed that 57 per cent of respondents viewed skilled trade jobs with low status stigma. Another 57 per cent viewed them as jobs with low pay, while another 50 per cent cited the lack of career advancement opportunities. Despite signs of interest and openness among the youth towards skilled trades, analysts said the perception gap and stigma about such jobs still linger. Dr Issac Lim, founder of social science consultancy Anthro Insights, said these jobs are bounded by concerns around status, earnings, stability and job demands. The momentum is still fragile and unlikely to sustain unless two structural issues are addressed head-on: persistent stigma and the pay or career-value gap relative to degree pathways. Dr Srinara said: If rosters are brutal or pay progression is unclear, then no amount of funding or portals will convince a young person to stay. And theres still a perception gap, as many parents and teachers still see skilled trades as a fallback, not a first choice, unlike professional, managerial, executive and technical jobs. As part of ongoing efforts to create more opportunities for Singaporeans to succeed, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon had said in Parliament in September 2025 that the Government will work with employers, the labour movement, trade associations and institutes of higher learning todevelop pathways for progression for those inclined towards hands-on and heart jobs. He did not provide a specific timeline for this initiative. While government efforts like Graduate Industry Traineeships and Careers and Skills Passport have been set in place to help young people secure traineeships and transit into trade jobs, analysts said more can be done to shift public perception. (Such initiatives) work best when employers redesign roles to be more sustainable and aspirational, and when schools and career counsellors start talking about hospitality trades as serious, future-proof careers, and not as fallbacks for those not so academically inclined, said Dr Srinara. We have to show that skilled trades are not dead ends. Concrete examples of how a room attendant becomes a floor supervisor, then an assistant executive housekeeper and eventually manages multiple properties, make a huge difference to parents and to the youth themselves. Dr Lim, who also teaches organisational behaviour at NUS Business School, added that young people are unlikely on their own to shift the underlying incentives and perceptions that keep many young locals away from the trades. Meanwhile, SFIC Institute hopes to build an ecosystem for its students and aspiring craftsmen professionals to turn to for support. We can help to accelerate this ecosystem development by forging deeper partnerships between training providers and industry clusters, and elevate woodworking careers through storytelling campaigns and success journeys, said the institutes Mr Ng. Said Dr Lim: If the goal is to grow local participation in 2026, the core test is simple: Can a tradesperson reliably achieve a decent middle-class living and social respect as a first-choice vocation?",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/farmer-plumber-lift-technician-more-young-people-in-singapore-drawn-to-skilled-trades

Finn Allen, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell and Tim Seifert are the specialist batters. Im really happy with the skills and experience of this squad and I think we have a group which can make New Zealand proud, head coach Rob Walter said. Weve got plenty of power and skill in the batting, quality bowlers who can adapt to conditions, plus five all-rounders who all bring something slightly different. This is an experienced group and the players are no strangers to playing in the sub-continent, which will be valuable.

She reached the Miami Open quarter-finals last year before ending her season early. Its been a good two and a bit months where I didnt play, she said. Its been difficult to kind of increase the load and add the unpredictability of the tennis. I think today, being able to produce that, having not played, is just giving me confidence to what I can do when I do practice more. Initially you feel a little bit alien on the court, in the first set, just playing points again. I know now I just need to get my head down, keep working.

Grizzled Czech Soucek had a hand in West Ham going in front after 13 minutes when his flick-on went into the net off Forest defender Murillo. But Forest levelled after the break through Nicolas Dominguez and Morgan Gibbs-White tucked away the winner from the spot after being clattered by West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola. Areola had been trying to intercept a ball into the crowded area but mistimed his punch and connected instead with the face of Gibbs-White and referee Tony Harrington awarded the penalty after a VAR check. Defeat left West Ham in 18th place, seven points behind Forest who sit one place above the relegation zone. For me it is a joke. I just saw it again and I think we can have 20 penalties per game if it is like that, Soucek said of the incident. I came to the Premier League because I thought it was the toughest league in the world and we are all fighters and warriors, but this looks more like basketball when you cant touch the player. This is what I saw. (Areola) came for the ball, I think I cleared it and that was already out. We didnt know why there was VAR and then the penalty, so it was tough for all of us. West Ham are now winless in 10 league games and manager Nuno Espirito Santo is under severe pressure after only two league wins since taking charge in September, following his sacking by Forest three games into the season. Soucek insisted the squad were still fully behind Espirito Santo but admitted West Ham were in big trouble. We have so many games but we have to do it from the first game. Now is the time. We have to be winning. Seven points, we cannot just win one or two, we have to win a few in a row, he said. I still believe and will until the end, but I have to say that we are in a really bad position. We will look to the mirror and know the position we are in.

Billed as a relegation six-pointer between the sides 17th and 18th in the table, West Ham took the lead thanks to a Murillo own goal but their hopes of ending a nine-match winless run faded in the second half. Nicolas Dominguez headed an equaliser for Forest in the 55th minute, shortly after West Hams Crysencio Summerville had seen a goal ruled out for a marginal offside decision. In a nervous finale, West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola clattered into Gibbs-White trying to deal with a ball into the area and referee Tony Harrington awarded a spot kick after viewing a pitch-side VAR monitor. Gibbs-White stepped up to convert in the 89th minute and Forest hung on for a crucial win that lifted them seven points above the drop zone. Forest have 21 points from 21 games with third-from-bottom West Ham on 14 after a 10-game run without a league win and pressure piling up on manager Nuno Espirito Santo. The previous meeting between the two clubs ended with West Ham scoring three late goals in a 3-0 win at the City Ground in August, a result that effectively ended Espirito Santos reign as Forest manager. Four months on, having replaced Graham Potter as West Ham manager in September, the Portuguese coach looked crestfallen in the rain after a damaging result that means he has won only two of his 16 league games in charge. At halftime, West Ham were on course to cut the gap to Forest to one point. By the end it was a seven-point margin and their survival hopes are looking bleak. FOUGHT RIGHT TO THE END Forest had lost four league games on the bounce but rode their luck at times as they got back to winning ways. It wasnt a nice game, we knew it was going to be a battle because of the position of both teams, Gibbs-White said. But what I liked is that we fought right to the end. When the (West Ham) goal was disallowed it changed the momentum of the game and gave us belief. West Ham made four changes to the side that lost 3-0 to bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers at the weekend, handing a debut to new forward signing Taty Castellanos while fellow new recruit Pablo Felipe came off the bench in the second half. And when the hosts took the lead in the 13th minute as Murillo inadvertently headed past his keeper Matz Sels after Tomas Soucek flicked on a corner there was hope amongst the home fans that the night could mark a turning point. There was a lack of belief though on the pitch and Forest were the better side and unlucky not to level when Callum Hudson-Odoi curled a superb effort against the crossbar. A flat mood in the stadium, with many empty seats, reflected the gloom at West Ham, but when Summerville thumped a shot past Sels soon after the break the mood was briefly buoyant. But a VAR check confirmed a marginal offside and when Dominguez looped in a flicked header in the 55th minute to make it 1-1 the writing seemed on the wall for the hosts. Captain Jarrod Bowen fired an effort wide for West Ham and was denied by a superb Murillo block but it was Forest who emerged with three vital points after Areolas rush of blood. We have to keep believing and sticking together, its not over yet. We keep on going, said Espirito Santo.

Luciano Spalletti stuck with David who missed a penalty in Saturdays 1-1 draw with Lecce, and the much-maligned forward repaid the managers faith by wrapping up the win along with providing an assist for Fabio Miretti. I had to score that goal and Im happy, Im happy with the win, David told DAZN. For me, the saddest thing about the missed penalty is that we left two points behind. Juventus are fourth in the standings on 36 points, three off leaders Inter Milan who have played two games fewer while Sassuolo are 11th on 23 points. The first real chance fell to Juventus, when Kenan Yildiz twisted and turned his way into the area but his powerful low shot was parried away by keeper Arijanet Muric and Andrea Cambiaso sent the rebound into the side netting. Khephren Thuram was next to try his luck for the visitors, sending his effort straight at the keeper before the opening goal came from an own goal in the 16th minute. Pierre Kalulu floated a ball into the Sassuolo area and defender Tarik Muharemovics header sailed over Muric, who was well off his line, and into his own net. Yildiz, a constant threat to the home side, had three shots from the edge of the area saved by the keeper before halftime. Juventus, for all their dominance, went in at the break with just that one-goal advantage against a Sassuolo side which failed to register an effort on target. DAVIDS REDEMPTION The away side continued to press in the second half. David passed to Miretti in the area and the off-balance midfielder sent his shot over the bar but he soon made up for that miss. David again provided the pass and this time Miretti raced into the box and powered his shot beyond Muric in the 62nd minute. David made it 3-0 one minute later. The Canadian pounced on a poor Jay Idzes pass back and made his way into the area where he went around the onrushing keeper before firing into the empty net. The scorer was swamped by his teammates and Spalletti, as a relieved David raced to celebrate his long-awaited goal. Its a nice touch, everyone here is so supportive of me and the team, so its a great sign that everyone can celebrate together, David added. I really appreciate this.

The flame began its journey across Italy from Rome a month ago and has been to the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, as well as the southern cities of Naples and Bari as part of a 12,000 kilometre (7,450 mile) journey that will end in Milans San Siro stadium on February 6. The relay on Tuesday took in the Formula One circuit in Imola, although its progress was slowed by snow that blanketed the Emilia-Romagna region. Teenage presenters from local broadcaster Radioimmaginaria, who helped to carry the torch across Bologna, dedicated their run to peers killed in a New Years Eve fire at the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana. Giovanni Tamburi, a 16-year-old from Bologna, was one of those who died in the blaze. The relay has been part of efforts to generate excitement across the country before the Games that will be staged at a variety of locations, with the financial capital Milan and the Alpine resort of Cortina dAmpezzo as the two main bases. MORE TICKETS GOING ON SALE As the Games approach, concerns over whether competition venues will be ready and accessible appear to be easing after weeks of uncertainty. Additional tickets will go on sale on Wednesday for the womens Alpine ski races in Cortina, local organisers said, indicating that some of the fears over transport issues had eased. Reuters reported in November that ticket sales for the Cortina venues had been capped because of worries over congestion and access to the Alpine resort. Johan Eliasch, president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, told Reuters on Tuesday that preparations were back on schedule, with snowmaking progressing well across the mountain venues after a slow start. In Milan, the main ice hockey venue will hold a first test event this coming weekend, leaving little time to iron out any teething troubles. The surface at the new Santagiulia ice hockey arena will be a little shorter than NHL specifications, which had raised some concerns over the risk of more high-speed collisions. Players from the elite North American NHL are due to return to the Olympics for the first time since 2014.

The Ivorians will face record seven-time winners Egypt in a heavyweight quarter-final in Agadir on Saturday, a colossal clash that is a repeat of the 2006 decider where the North African side triumphed on penalties after a 0-0 draw. Yan Diomande and Bazoumana Toure were also on target for coach Emerse Faes team as they dominated the contest against the out-gunned Burkinabe and might have won by a greater margin but for some excellent goalkeeping from Herve Koffi. Diallo, 23, will go back to a new manager at Manchester United after the finals in Morocco having been one of the stand-out players at the tournament so far with three goals and an assist, driving the Ivorians impressive title defence. Theres this understanding on the field, this closeness between us, which makes our game easier, Diallo said. There is a real connection, a kind of little twist in the way we play. No one is trying to be the hero or shine individually. Compared to how they stuttered to the title on home soil two years ago, the Ivorians have been hugely impressive in Morocco and this was arguably their most dominant display of the competition to date. They took the lead in the 20th minute thanks to a superb solo effort from Diallo, who danced his way past three defenders before a fortunate deflection allowed him to lift the ball over the goalkeeper and into the roof of the net. DIALLO TURNS PROVIDER It was 2-0 on 32 minutes and no more than the Ivorians deserved for their positive attacking play. This time Diallo was the creator as his trickery on the right wing ended with a low cross that was cleverly left by Franck Kessie and the ball reached Diomande, who side-footed into the net from 18 yards. The Burkinabe were inches away from pulling a goal back as Dango Ouattaras shot from a tight angle hit the post, but it proved a rare bright moment. The Ivorians kept pushing forward and would end with 21 shots at goal, with one of those leading to their third score on 87 minutes. Toure broke free on the left-hand side of the box and with Koffi perhaps expecting a cross, the teenage winger instead netted at the near post for his second of the campaign.
