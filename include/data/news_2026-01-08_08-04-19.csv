Food operators say new grading system is fairer as it rewards consistent food safety practices,"Jan 08, 2026, 03:20 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:20 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b89b0cc6beaff4ce17b3c5ee8f64bcb76f1dade2775a1846af6c6e845093cdda,The new framework focuses more on an establishments track record instead of yearly snapshot assessments.ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO,"['SFA/Singapore Food Agency', 'Food hygiene/safety', 'Food and drink', 'Food and beverage sector']","SINGAPORE - The upcoming replacement of the food grading system in Singapore with a framework that focuses more on an establishments track record instead of yearly snapshot assessments is a welcome move, some food establishments here told The Straits Times. They say the implementation of the scheme, which will take place from Jan 19, is fairer as it rewards consistent long-term performance instead of assessments made at a specific point in time. Tung Lok Groups chief executive for events & catering division Sunil Shamdasani said shifting from a one-off, annual assessment of a food establishments food safety regime to a framework that reflects a firms long-term food safety track record is more meaningful. Food safety is top priority and is not something that should be judged on a single inspection. There has to be consistent daily practices, discipline, and culture within the operation, he said. He added that the new framework will encourage accountability and benefit consumers by giving them greater confidence in where they dine. Tung Lok Group was one of six food businesses who spoke to The Straits Times on the new Safety Assurance for Food Establishments (SAFE) framework, after itwas announcedby the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) on Jan 7. The framework will apply to an estimated 45,000 SFA-licensed food establishments, including food caterers, restaurants, hawker stalls, bakeries and food carts. Under the existing grading system, food establishments are graded A, B, C, or D, based on an annual assessment by SFA. The current system has been in place for close to three decades. Outlets are graded based on overall hygiene, cleanliness and housekeeping standards of the premises in a snapshot assessment. Under the SAFE framework, however, food establishments with consistently good food safety track records will attain higher grades, said SFA. Those with poor food safety track records will receive lower grades and be subjected to more frequent inspections, the agency added. For example, a food establishment will receive a grade A if it has a good track record of more than three years. If there is a major lapse in ensuring food safety at an establishment, such as receiving a court conviction for food safety-related offences, it will be immediately downgraded to a grade C. Mr Anthony Yeoh, owner of restaurant Summer Hill, said the new system may be more efficient as authorities can look out for the establishments that perform poorly and keep a closer eye on where food safety risks may affect consumers. Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwangs owner Noorman Mubarak said that the new framework is fairer for food operators as it rewards stalls that maintain good cleanliness with better grading and less frequent inspections. He added that the new framework will not affect his current operations as he has in place an existing cleaning regime. His staff members also still wear masks although it isno longer required. The new framework will also differentiate food establishments into two categories, based on the level of food processing or preparation involved. Category 1 includes food establishments involved in significant processing or preparation of food such as food caterers. Category 2 establishments are considered to be engaged in low or moderate levels of food processing or preparation like food stalls in hawker centres. In the future, food establishments under Category 1 will be subjected to more stringent requirements to attain and maintain grade A, as they are engaged in a larger scale of food processing or preparation. These include having to appoint an advanced food hygiene officer and implement a food safety management system. No date has been announced yet for when this future phase of the framework will kick in. Catering and food manufacturer Neo Groups chief operating officer Rachel Teo said the move to categorise the establishments is a critical change as it allows customers to assess food providers and make more informed decisions for events involving food. While adapting to the new framework may be challenging at first, as it takes time and resources to hire and train staff members, Ms Teo said that the long-term benefits of ensuring food safety outweigh the early challenges. However, some food establishments also raised concerns on whether the new framework will be applied to other food-handling businesses, such as home-based businesses. The new framework will apply only to SFA-licensed food establishments. Home-based food businesses currently do not require an SFA licence to operate, according to the agencys website. Mr Melvin Chew, owner of Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck & Kway Chap in Chinatown Complex, said that home-based businesses should also be subjected to a similar food safety grading system. When it comes to food safety and food hygiene, all food businesses, including hawkers, restaurants, central kitchens and home-based businesses, should be subjected to a standardised system so that it is fair to all, he said. It gives the impression that home-based businesses dont have to focus on hygiene as there is no authority keeping an eye on them, he added. According to SFAs website, home-based businesses are still required to comply with prevailing food laws and regulations, such as making sure their premises are properly maintained and kept clean. Home-based businesses implicated in food safety incidents may also be directed to stop operations immediately or to recall food products sold. Another concern raised is that the additional requirements for Category 1 establishments may add to the existing pressures faced by F&B businesses, especially smaller ones. Rising ingredient costs and high rents have continued to squeeze Singapores food and beverage sector, which faced a challenging year in 2025 marked by the closure of several Michelin-starred restaurants and long-established brands amid mounting business challenges. Mr Yeoh from Summer Hill said that given the existing pressures F&B operators are dealing with, it is likely that many will turn to the least costly and hassle-free option. More establishments may be happy to settle for a B grade, as long as the food they serve is safe and can continue to operate, he said, adding that the implications of having a B grade is unclear now. Especially for smaller outlets, I cant see much willingness to fundamentally change the way we operate if it means adding more tasks and rules to follow.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/food-operators-say-new-grading-system-is-fairer-as-it-rewards-consistent-food-safety-practices
Home Improvement Programme voting process to be studied after 2 Tiong Bahru HDB blocks miss threshold,"Jan 08, 2026, 02:40 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:38 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/06a11289cc76f33d36a1b985a2b60f6c2da4ac38ec1dc33299408a8a06ba4c1b,"Of the 24 units in Block 34 Kim Cheng Street, 16 voted in favour of the HIP, two voted against and six did not vote.ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY","['HDB', 'Public housing', 'Ministry of National Development', 'Housing policy']","SINGAPORE - The authorities will study the voting process for the Home Improvement Programme (HIP), aftertwo HDB blocks in Tiong Bahru narrowly missed the voting threshold in November. Responding to a question on whether the authorities are planning to review the HIP voting threshold, National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat said on Jan 8 that the authorities will need to strike a balance between upgrading older flats and respecting the decisions of flat owners. He noted that blocks with fewer units may face challenges in meeting the 75 per cent voting threshold to proceed with the upgrading programme. Whats the best way to design the voting process so that we are able to achieve a good outcome? Mr Chee said to reporters on the sidelines ofa visit to ParkEdge @ Bidadari. He added: MND (Ministry of National Development) and HDB will take a look at this. We will also consult the stakeholders on what is a better way to manage this process. The two blocks – Block 34 Kim Cheng Street and Block 35 Lim Liak Street – had failed to garner enough votes to pass the 75 per cent threshold by a narrow margin of two votes and one, respectively. Block 34 comprises 24 units, while Block 35 has 15 units. They were among 29 blocks in the neighbourhood where residents voted in November on whether to carry out HIP improvements. Voting was successful for the other 27 blocks. All the blocks are four-storey, walk-up flats built in 1949 by Singapore Improvement Trust, the predecessor to HDB. Residents in the two unsuccessful blockscould get a second chance to vote in 2026, depending on the level of support from residents, Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Foo Cexiang told ST in December. HIP was launched in 2007 to spruce up older housing estates and resolve common maintenance problems, such as spalling concrete. It is carried out only if at least 75 per cent of a blocks eligible Singaporean households have voted for it. Permanent resident households are not eligible to vote. More details on HIP II – the second round of upgrades that HDB flats will undergo at the 60- to 70-year mark – will be announced when ready. On Jan 8, Mr Chee was also asked for an update on the framework of the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS). He said he hopes to avoid a bunching effect where many flats of a similar age are redeveloped in one go. It will be very disruptive for the residents and for the businesses. Instead, what we want to do is to spread this out so that we do it in an orderly manner, he said. The voting threshold for VERS is also being studied, he said. VERS, which has yet to be rolled out, will allow owners of flats aged 70 years and older to vote on whether the Government should buy back their homes before their 99-year leases run out. Other policies aimed at gradually redeveloping older towns include the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, Silver Upgrading Programme as well as the HIP, Mr Chee said. He had said in August that the Government aims to roll out VERS to a few sites in the first half of the 2030s. The authorities aim to develop and flesh out the VERS framework in this term of government, including setting parameters to identify possible sites, ensuring sufficient homes are ready in time for residents to relocate to, and working out a fair package for residents.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/hip-voting-process-to-be-studied-after-2-tiong-bahru-blocks-fail-to-meet-threshold-chee-hong-tat
"19,600 BTO flats to be launched this year; 2027 flat supply to increase if demand remains strong","Jan 08, 2026, 12:00 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:33 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e01cd1ffd980e665ff586e43516398f61d2eeb9d0e72d731ec2630df21f0a5ae,"HDB said it is on track to meet its target of offering about 55,000 flats from 2025 to 2027 to meet the demand for housing.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI","['HDB', 'Public housing', 'Housing policy']","SINGAPORE – About 19,600 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats will be launched in 2026, with next years projected flat supply to increase if demand remains strong. The HDB, which plans to build55,000 flats between 2025 and 2027, has been asked to go beyond this target if necessary, said National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat on Jan 8. A strong supply of new flats will make homes more accessible, and help moderate prices of resale flats by shifting demand away from the resale market, he added. For 2026, we will press on with what we have started, which is to build more and build faster, Mr Chee said. This will also lay the groundwork for the BTO income ceiling and singles eligibility age to be reviewed, he added. He will also prioritise moves to make Singapores operating environment more pro-business, improve productivity and help companies be more efficient. Mr Chee was speaking to reporters during a visit to ParkEdge @ Bidadari, one of the four last projects to be completed in the estate. Shortly after taking office in May 2025, Mr Chee had announced that 55,000 BTO flats would be launched between 2025 and 2027 - an increase from the 50,000 announced by his predecessor in January. A robust supply of public housing has since led to some initial signs of progress in making flats more accessible and affordable, he said on Jan 8. Application rates for BTO flats have come down since 2020, when the median rate for three-room and larger flats stood at seven, meaning that there were seven applicants for each flat. In 2025, this figure has come down to 1.1 to 1.9. Resale price growth also moderated in 2025. Prices went up 0.9 per cent in the second quarter, and 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, remaining unchanged in the fourth quarter. And more flats are expected toreach their minimum occupation period in 2026, which means they can be sold on the resale market. This is also expected to moderate resale flat prices. Mr Chee reiterated that flats have remained affordable, as nine in 10 first-time buyers in 2025 could pay their HDB housing loans using their CPF, with little or no cash. Among the 19,600 new flats to be launched this year, over 4,000 will have shorter waits of less than three years. In 2027, another 4,000 such flats will be launched, he said. This years crop of BTO flats will be launched over three sales exercises – in February, June and October – in towns such as Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Sembawang, Toa Payoh, Tampines, Woodlands and Yishun, the Housing Board said on Jan 8. The flats will comprise a mix of Standard, Plus and Prime flats. Mr Chee said the ministry will continue its review of the BTO income ceiling, age floor for single applicants and the 15-month wait-out period for private home owners who want to downgrade to a resale flat. Each move would depend on market conditions and may take place at different times, he said. Should the income threshold be raised and the singles eligibility age lowered, demand will go up, he noted. But if supply cannot keep pace, the result may be longer waiting times for a flat and fewer successful applicants, he said. We will look at the evidence, but I am confident that if the current trends continue, we will be able to make a move on all three issues going forward. Mr Chee also addressed a question on the lack of five-room flats being built in Prime and Plus projects. He said that if more five-room flats are built, the trade-off is having fewer units of other flat types. But he also empathised with the needs of larger families, saying that he will see what we can do to build more five-room flats without reducing supply elsewhere. This might be done by developing more areas and building more units on a given plot of land through good design, he said. HDB launched a total of 19,723 BTO flats in 2025. About 19,600 flats across 28 projects were also completed last year, with the median wait time for a flat at about four years. Of the 28 developments completed, three were shorter waiting-time projects that had waits of less than three years. They were Parc Clover @ Tengah, a 1,124-unit project, Hougang Olive with 390 units, and Yishun Boardwalk with 852 units. The Tengah and Hougang projects were launched in November 2021, while the Yishun development wasput up for sale in February 2022. HDB said there are 127 housing projects under construction at present, up from 110 a year ago. HDB also announced on Jan 8 that all public housing projects in the Bidadari estate have been completed, a decade after its first BTO projects were launched. The last four public housing projects in Bidadari were wrapped up in 2025: ParkEdge @ Bidadari, ParkView @ Bidadari, Bartley Beacon and Bartley GreenRise. In all, 8,872 flats were constructed across 12 public housing developments in the 93ha estate. At present, 98 per cent of home buyers – comprising 8,327 of the 8,443 flats booked – have moved into or collected the keys to their homes, HDB said. Amenities in the town have also been built up to meet residents needs – Woodleigh Mall opened in May 2023 while Woodleigh Village Hawker Centre opened in September 2024. The 13ha Bidadari Park, which is situated at the heart of the estate,opened in September 2024. The park has walking trails, play areas and open lawns, as well as Alkaff Lake, which serves as a retention pond to manage the growing threat of flash floods amid climate change. A heritage walk in the park, which recounts the history of Bidadari through a series of storyboards, will be fully opened in the third quarter of 2026. A memorial garden, which commemorates Bidadaris history as one of Singapores oldest cemeteries, will be opened in the first quarter of 2026.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/19600-bto-flats-to-be-launched-in-2026-over-4000-have-shorter-wait-times

Samy, 32, was sentenced to three months and one weeks jail on Jan 7.ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG","['State Courts', 'Singapore courts', 'Vaping/E-cigarettes']","SINGAPORE - To supplement his income, a bus driver accepted a job to deliver e-cigarette paraphernalia to Singapore. He was caught red-handed on July 8, 2025, by officers at Woodlands Checkpoint, who had noticed anomalies in the luggage compartment of the bus. Mahendran K.V.K. Samy, 32, was sentenced to three months and one weeks jail on Jan 7, after he pled guilty to one charge of importing the components of an imitation tobacco product. Court documents stated that Mahendran, a Malaysian, was employed as a bus driver at a Malaysian transport company at the time of the offence. His job was to ferry passengers between Malaysia and Singapore. He earned about RM2,500 (S$790) a month, which was not enough to sustain him and his family. Two weeks before he was apprehended, Mahendran received a call from a private number, offering him a job to deliver e-cigarette paraphernalia to Singapore. He was offered RM2,000 in cash for a successful delivery. Despite having never met the person on the line, Mahendran agreed to take the job. On July 6, 2025, he received a call from the unknown person, whom he called Abang. He was told to leave the bus and its keys unattended on the side of the road at a specified location in Johor Bahru after he returned from dropping off passengers in Singapore. At about 4.30am the next day, Mahendran did as he was told and gave Abang the bus registration number for easy identification. At about 10am, he received a call from Abang informing him that the goods had been loaded onto the bus. He was instructed to smuggle the items into Singapore on July 8, 2025. Once he cleared Singapore Customs, Abang would contact him with instructions on where to deliver the goods. When Mahendran was crossing Woodlands Checkpoint at about 4.20pm on July 8, a search and examination officer directed his vehicle to be scanned. The accused seemed reluctant to open the luggage compartment of the bus and claimed that he did not (have) the key, said Health Sciences Authority prosecutor Jolene Chia. The officers looked into the luggage compartment from the other side of the bus and noticed brown cardboard-like material inside it. Mahendran then said he had the key and opened the compartment. The cardboard boxes were found to contain 3,899 e-cigarette cartridges. Ms Chia sought a jail term of 20 weeks for Mahendran, citing the increased prevalence of vaping offences and the shift towards stiffer enforcement by the Government. She also noted that Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had announced during his National Day Rally speech on Aug 17, 2025, that theGovernment would be taking tougher action against vaping. In mitigation, Mahendran, who was unrepresented, asked the judge for leniency as he was taking care of his mother and siblings. He said: I truly apologise for committing this offence, Your Honour. While meting out the sentence, District Judge Terrence Tay said vaping is an increasing problem in Singapore, especially affecting young people. He added that stiff sentences are warranted as deterrence would be the main sentencing consideration. For importing an imitation tobacco product, an offender can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/bus-driver-jailed-for-smuggling-e-cigarettes-into-singapore

The event, which lasted fromMarch 19 to 20, contributed significantly to that months rainfall, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) on Jan 8. In itsannual climate and weather report for 2025,MSS noted that the islandwide average rainfall over the two days was 272.3mm. This exceeded the months long-term average of 209.7mm. The average rainfall in March 2025 was 130 per cent above the norm, at 482.9mm, added the weatherman. Overall, 2025 was off to an exceptionally wet start due to a series of monsoon surges – a weather phenomenon that brings rain and cooler weather to the country – in January and March. Downpours in both months due to three monsoon surge events made 2025 the seventh-wettest year for Singapore since 1980, said MSS. Monsoon surges occur when bursts of cold, dry air from wintry regions like Central Asia move over the warm waters of the South China Sea, picking up moisture. This brings extensive rainfall, strong winds and cooler temperatures to Singapore. At times, near Singapore, the winds may interact with a separate whirlpool of air, where winds are forced to move upwards, forming clouds. This is called a low-pressure vortex, which worsens the deluge over the country. While it is common for such surges to occur in December and January during the wet phase of the north-east monsoon, the March surge was unusual as it happenedduring the dry phase of the monsoon season. The dry phase of the monsoon season is called such as the rain band shifts away from Singapore. Asked about possible reasons for the unusual monsoon surge event then, an MSS spokesperson told The Straits Times that the rain band had remained close to Singapore last March. At the same time, other key features of a strong monsoon surge were present, (including) the presence of a vortex near Singapore, added the spokesperson. The first monsoon surge of the year between Jan 10 and 13 alsobroke rainfall records for the month of January, MSS said in the report,which summarised key weather data in 2025. The months highest-ever daily rainfall of 241.8mm was recorded at Pulau Tekong on Jan 10. This surpassed the previous high of 238.2mm recorded on Jan 30, 2011, on Pulau Ubin. That day, the non-stop rain over Singapore coincided with high tides that resulted in flooding in some coastal areas in the low-lying East Coast area.For instance,a nearly three-hour flood was recordedin Jalan Seaview in Mountbatten. The four-day downpour last Januaryalso delayed and diverted flights, and affected businesses. Apart from the rain brought about by monsoon surges at the start of 2025, Singapore also experienced the effects of a different climate phenomenon, La Nina, during that period. La Nina events, caused by changes in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure across the Pacific Ocean, brings cooler and wetter weather to the Republic and South-east Asia. MSS said the short-lived La Nina climate phenomenon at the start of 2025 moderated Singapores temperatures in the first half of the year. From May to August, monthly rainfall was closer to their respective long-term averages, MSS said. But wetter conditions were also registered in Singapore from September onwards, about 40 per cent above the months long-term average. La Nina conditions emerged again towards the end of 2025,coinciding with another rain-bearing phenomenon– the negative Indian Ocean Dipole – which contributed to wetter conditions in the region, said MSS. This climate pattern causes warmer waters to pool around parts of South-east Asia and Australia, fuelling the formation of rain clouds in the region. Overall, Singapores average total rainfall for 2025 was more than 2,900mm – 18 per cent above the long-term average of 2,534mm. Temperature records were also broken in 2025, the MSS report showed, with the year yielding the hottest June and November on record. June was the years warmest month, tied with that of 1997. In both years, the average temperature in June reached a high of 29.3 deg C. The sixth month of the year also marks the start of the dry south-west monsoon season, which lasts till September. In October and November, Singapore experiencedinter-monsoon conditions, wherewinds are usually light and weak. During this period, hot afternoons and warm nights are common. Novembers average temperature was 28.2 deg C, up from the previous record of 28 deg C in 1998, 2015 and 2019. But despite the rainy, cool weather in Singapore at the beginning and end of 2025, the year still marked the Republics eighth-warmest year on record, with a mean temperature of 28.1 deg C, tying with 2010 and 2002. The years 2024, 2019 and 2016 are the joint warmest years in Singapore since record-keeping began in 1929, with mean temperatures of 28.4 deg C. MSS also noted that Singapore experienced 29 days of high heat stress in 2025, compared with 21 days in 2024. This increase was due to the set-up of more sensors islandwide that measure heat stress, said MSS. Heat stress is measured by the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which takes into account air temperature, humidity levels, wind speed and solar radiation. High heat stress is felt when the WBGT hits 33 deg C. Those engaging in outdoor activities are urged to take longer breaks indoors, minimise exertion and drink more fluids, among other precautions. Singapores highest WBGT in 2025 was 35 deg C, recorded at Sentosa Palawan Green on Oct 31.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/record-wet-march-in-spore-last-year-due-to-monsoon-surge-june-nov-2025-also-warmest-experienced

As a result, graduates are expected to possess more than just academic knowledge: Soft skills like adaptability, real-world experience and global awareness are increasingly important prerequisites across many industries. It is against this backdrop that Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) is rethinking how it supports its students, moving away from a one-size-fits-all model towards an approach that reflects each learners strengths, interests and goals. Starting in the new academic year this April, NYP will launch its Go Beyond initiative, which features three pathways that allow students to customise their diploma journey in line with their academic and career aspirations. Importantly, these pathways are integrated into the curriculum, with no increase in hours. This means students do not need to take on additional modules or extend their studies beyond the standard three-year diploma programme. Depending on their chosen pathway, students will gain real-world experiences through internships and overseas exchange programmes, as well as earn relevant industry-recognised certifications. As most of these are assessed on a pass-or-fail basis and excluded from Grade Point Average (GPA) computation, students can fully immerse themselves in the experience without worrying about attaining a specific grade. At the heart of this new initiative is the recognition that students have different ambitions and definitions of success. NYP principal and chief executive officer Russell Chan explains: Our learners come from a diverse profile, and have their own aspirations, needs and wants. For instance, there are a fair few who seek to work prior to going on to university. Others will want to build international networks and experiences during their three years in the polytechnic. The idea is that we will have choices that align to what is important to them and they can embark on these pathways while in NYP. To cater to this wider range of needs, NYP has developed the Professional, International and University pathways, each designed to provide support and guidance, while still allowing students to keep their options open. For those who plan to progress to further studies, the University pathway offers support such as scholarships advisory, interview preparation and portfolio development. Following that, students will pursue one of three specialised options that may provide module exemptions, foundation-level preparation for university matriculation or conditional university offers. Others who are keen to gain practical experience can opt for the Professional pathway, which focuses on extended industry exposure. This includes internship opportunities that allow students to gain real-world working experience before graduation. Students will also earn industry-recognised certifications that strengthen their workplace readiness. There is also the option to undertake internships ranging from 12 weeks to a year. Those who go on 12-week internship will also complete a final year project or Teaching Enterprise Project. All experiences in the Professional pathway contribute to graduation requirements, and are included in the GPA. Those with global aspirations can embark on the International pathway, which offers overseas exchange or internship opportunities with more than 60 overseas university partners across 17 countries, including France, Finland, Switzerland, South Korea and Japan. These programmes are typically undertaken in the second or third year, when students have sufficient grounding to fully benefit from the experience. For those who opt for the overseas internship, they will undergo a 12- to 24-week overseas internship placement at an NYP partner company, gaining exposure to diverse work cultures while strengthening their global outlook and employability. With Go Beyond, students can explore experiences across all three pathways and choose one or more that support their individual ambitions. This flexibility helps them discover what suits them best.

"Proposed law changes in Spore will cut red tape in data sharing, speed up social support: Experts","Jan 07, 2026, 09:10 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 11:28 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/adb72148d9179d18ca107ff6e65fd7ae9c72870daf363c18784d38daa50ecff6,Amendments to the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA) are expected to be tabled for second reading when Parliament sits in the week of Jan 12.PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: TNP FILE,"['Data protection', 'Personal Data Protection Act', 'Singapore Parliament']","SINGAPORE –New amendments to the lawthat would allow government agencies to share data with external parties, such as social service agencies and community groups, will ensure more effective and timely delivery of services for Singaporeans. Without the proposed changes, the Government will have to seek consent from individuals before their data is shared, or establish legally that such sharing is in the public interest. That process can be slow and legally uncertain even for clearly public-spirited programmes, said experts. The proposed changes provide legal clarity for data sharing and hold external parties accountable to standards similar to those applied to public agencies, they added. Amendments to the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA) are expected to be tabled for second reading when Parliament sits in the week of Jan 12. A public consultation to discuss the recommended changes was held for three weeks between Aug 12, 2025, and Sept 2, 2025. Introduced in 2018, the PSGA allows for data sharing across the public sector, and sets out data protection and sharing requirements for government agencies. Under the law, data can be shared between public sector agencies for seven specific purposes. These include improving the efficiency or effectiveness of policy planning and service delivery, and supporting a whole-of-government approach in public sector work. Under the amendments, the Government would be able to rely on these seven prescribed purposes to share data with authorised external parties. The amendments also require that the minister who is responsible for the relevant public sector agency to authorise each case of data sharing with an external partner. The authorisation must be documented, clearly stating the specified purposes for which the data will be used, and identifying which of the PSGA purposes provides the basis for sharing. The specified partners and the parties engaged by them, as well as the specific scope of data to be shared, must also be documented. Mr Lim Chong Kin, head of technology, media and telecommunications at law firm Drew & Napier, noted that many front-line services today are delivered by external partners such as social service agencies, community groups and trade associations, which often have closer and more direct contact with residents and businesses. Without timely access to relevant data, these partners may face delays in identifying needs, verifying eligibility or providing assistance, he said. For example, community organisations providing social assistance may need timely access to a list of eligible households in a neighbourhood to distribute aid or offer follow-up support. Without this, assistance may be delayed or miss those most in need. Under current laws, government agencies have to seek consent from individuals or families before they can share data with external partners. But there are challenges to seeking consent. For example, a government agency may already know who needs help based on previous support, but it will have to seek consent for new programmes. Another challenge is that individuals may be uncontactable due to missing or outdated contact information, or they may miss notifications – which prevents them from receiving help under new programmes. Another scenario arises when multiple partners are involved in delivering coordinated services to individuals. In such a case, the individuals have to repeatedly give consent to all partners. If they miss giving consent to one party, their data is incomplete and the services they receive will be limited. Another way that agencies seek to share data with external partners is to establish legally that data sharing meets the common law ground of public interest. But experts say that can be an onerous process. As the common law develops on a case-by-case basis, there is presently a lack of legal certainty and clarity about whether specific purposes or circumstances would comprise public interest grounds, said Mr Lim. Concurring, Mr Josh Lee, managing director (Apac) of non-profit organisation Future of Privacy Forum, said that agencies often have to go through multiple layers of internal governance and legal review to determine what is public interest. As part of the review, agencies likely need to be satisfied that a proposed sharing of data is linked to a legitimate public purpose, that the data is necessary to achieve that purpose, and that the same outcome cannot be achieved through other means, said Mr Lee, adding that public officers would be more cautious as the PSGA carries criminal penalties for wrongful disclosure. In addition, if there is a new community initiative or pilot programme, it may need to be re-assessed afresh, said Mr Lee. This can cause delays or discourage potentially beneficial collaborations. While the experts acknowledge that some Singaporeans may have concerns about their personal data being shared with external parties, they also highlighted the safeguards in the proposed amendments. These include provisions ensuring that external parties who misuse shared data may be subject to the same level of penalties as public officers under the PSGA. It criminalises the acts of unauthorised disclosure of data, misuse of data and the re-identification of individuals from anonymised data. Public officers found guilty of these offences can be fined up to $5,000 and jailed for up to two years. In addition, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) obligations and penalties – which primarily applies to private sector organisations – will continue to apply for these external partners. Professor Simon Chesterman, the David Marshall Professor of Law at the National University of Singapore, said that the amendments are clearer on accountability. External partners remain subject to the PDPA, and the amended PSGA framework ensures that external parties who mishandle shared government data will face consequences. But Mr Lee said whether the safeguards are sufficient will depend on how the provisions and data governance practices are implemented over time. It may be prudent for greater support to be extended to external parties that receive public sector data on enhancing data governance practices and internal compliance controls, and navigating the twin regimes of the PSGA and the PDPA, he added. Concurring, Prof Chesterman said: If more sensitive data is to be shared to improve service delivery, there should be commensurate investment in partner capability – clear minimum standards, practical support, and proportionate compliance expectations – so partners are not given new responsibilities without the capacity to carry them out safely. Overall, experts agree that the amendments strike a balance between safeguarding personal data of Singaporeans, and enabling it to be used responsibly. These amendments tilt the scale towards suiting Singapores model of efficiency, which is necessary to enable the Government to work with social service agencies and community groups to deliver effective and timely support to Singaporeans, especially where more timely help is being expected by Singaporeans arising from the ageing population and other welfare challenges, said Mr Lim.",https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/proposed-law-changes-in-spore-to-cut-red-tape-in-data-sharing-speed-up-social-support-experts

Orison Toh Chun Kee, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of possessing vapes for sale and one charge of offering vapes for sale via the Telegram messaging app. Two other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. Toh was initially expected to plead guilty on Aug 25, 2025, but Health Sciences Authority (HSA) prosecutor Jolene Chia told the court that the authority intended torelook its sentencing submissions. The prosecution had initially sought a weeks jail and a $1,500 fine for Toh, but later increased this to 12 weeks and a $3,000 fine, citing how District Judge Wong Li Tein had, in a separate case on Aug 21, 2025,asked HSA to relook their sentencing submissions for all vape offences. Judge Wong said it was not feasible to rely on sentencing precedents from 2022 to 2024 for vaping-related cases, given public sentiment. Court records showed that Toh, who was employed as an engineer at the time of the offences, began delivering vape parcels in February 2024 and earned about $10 per trip. On Sept 2, 2025, HSA was alerted to a consignment containing vapes received by a company. HSA officers went to the location the next day and saw Toh collecting the parcel. When they searched his car, they found vapes and vape pods that were leftover deliveries from the day before. A total of 1,639 vapes were found in Tohs car. Toh later said he had planned to start selling vapes but did not manage to do so. Explaining the rationale for the increased recommended sentence, Ms Chia told the court that it was based on the increase in the number of vape offences and the governments tougher stance towards vaping offences. She also cited Prime Minister Lawrence Wongs National Day Rally speech, where he announced that thegovernment would treat vaping as a drug issue. Tohs lawyer, Mr Sameer Amir Melber, from Gabriel Law, asked for a fine, saying it was difficult to understand why the prosecution was increasing the sentence by such a high amount. He added that Toh had intended to plead guilty in April 2025, and there was no evidence to show that he was part of a syndicate or that any etomidate-laced devices were linked to his conduct. In sentencing, District Judge Terence Tay said Tohs role was critical to such illicit operations, as he was the interface between the mastermind and customers. He added that vaping is an increasing problem in Singapore that affects younger people. As the detection of such activities is extremely difficult, the judge said a stiff sentence was warranted, but it had to take into account the sentencing range prescribed by the law. For each charge of selling vapes, an offender can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/vape-seller-given-increased-jail-term-of-8-weeks-after-prosecution-reviews-sentencing-framework
"Uncertainty, cautious optimism for Venezuelans in Spore after capture of Maduro","Jan 07, 2026, 08:34 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 10:33 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5760550494859bffc448ef4e269a69c1b53b8e238dbbeb43b69e89726a1ca34a,Captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores being escorted to a courthouse in New York on Jan 5.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['Venezuela', 'Nicolas Maduro', 'Donald Trump']","SINGAPORE – On Jan 3, Martin was driving to a meeting at VivoCity at about 2pm when the 39-year-old received an unexpected call from his brother in Venezuela. Its happening. The US is bombing Venezuela, his brother said over the phone. Some 15,000km away, a twilight military operation was under way in Martins birth country that would see US military forces launch strikes andseize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduroand his wife Cilia Flores to face criminal charges in the United States. Speaking to The Straits Times on Jan 6, Martin said his immediate reaction was worry for his father and siblings, who live in the capital Caracas and other Venezuelan cities such as Guacara. A naturalised Singaporean working in the entertainment industry here, he declined to give his surname as he wanted to protect his family back home. I was very anxious, very worried, he said. Because when these things happen, you cannot do anything, being so far away. Over a 2½-hour period, US strikes hit Caracas as well as the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to the Venezuelan government. Martins brother, who lives about a 30-minute drive from La Guaira city with his wife and two daughters, told him that they could feel the impact of the explosions from their home. After that call, Martin scrambled to check in with other friends and family members in Venezuela, and was assured via voice messages that they were safe. Initial reports estimated that 55 security personnel were killed in the operation, but more recent assessments suggested that fatalities were higher and may have included civilians. It was a relief to hear that (they were well). My father is almost 80 years old, so I was happy to know that he and everybody were okay, said Martin, whose account mirrored those of other Venezuelans living in Singapore. Maduros capture has been the talk of the wider Hispanic community here, after US President Donald Trump followed the operation with rhetoric on Jan 5 thatthreatened military action against Colombia,and said that he believed the government in Cuba was likely to fall soon. Latin American Chamber of Commerce, Singapore founder Angela Torres, 47, said her friends in Venezuela have expressed a sense of cautious optimism following Maduros capture. She said that in the past, Venezuela was a very wealthy country, with a robust industry and an economy heavily concentrated in oil. What is happening in Venezuela is actually very complex because even as Maduro has been taken out, the complication is that his regime remains, said Ms Torres, who is also executive director of the chamber of commerce. There is still a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty, everything is very silent and quiet at the moment in Venezuela, she added. Everybodys like, in a wait-and-see mode. Ms Torres, who is Colombian, said people are wondering if there will be follow-up operations to detain Maduro loyalists. Mr Trump has warned Venezuelas remaining leaders that theycould be targeted if they do not cooperate with Washington. For one Venezuelan woman who has lived in Singapore for about a decade, initial happiness over the US capture of Maduro dissipated when it became clear that the post-Maduro government would still be staffed by the same establishment. Venezuelas interim President Delcy Rodriguez, who wassworn in on Jan 5, was formerly the countrys vice-president under Maduro. The Venezuelan woman in Singapore, who declined to be named out of concern for her family back home, described the situation under the previous regime as having become crueller and more repressive year after year. An estimated 7.7 million Venezuelans, or about a fifth of the population, have left their homeland since 2014 to escape Venezuelas economic and political crisis. My country is so rich in resources and opportunity, yet nowadays, people are living so poorly, she said, adding that several of her peers had sought better lives abroad. After she learnt of the US military operation, the woman, who is in her 40s, checked in with her family in Venezuela via WhatsApp and was relieved that they were safe. She said: Im watching the situation to see how it develops. For me to be optimistic (about Venezuelas future), there needs to be more changes. Ms Torres said many Colombians are optimistic that the recent events may be good for Venezuelas long-term prospects. She noted that the two countries, which share an extensive border, used to be each others main trading partner. She dismissed Mr Trumps threat of military action against Colombia, noting that Colombia and Venezuela are in very different situations. Even while (Colombian) President Gustavo Petro and President Trump have a lot of disagreements, President Petro was democratically elected, and he is in the final term. A new president will be elected on May 31, she said. Colombia has also been very close to the US administration for many years before this. Most importantly, Colombia has very strong institutions, like the courts and Congress.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/uncertainty-cautious-optimism-for-venezuelans-in-spore-after-capture-of-maduro

Is South Korea ready for an era of ageing drivers?,"Jan 08, 2026, 03:38 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:40 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/190919c7579d1304abe5ef3b0a7401a5c66bffc9a26d40d6eaf4bebb9b1537a4,"As South Koreas population ages, the number of elderly drivers has increased rapidly.PHOTO: AFP","['South Korea', 'Cars', 'Ageing']","SEOUL - The investigation into a deadly January traffic accident in central Seoul is sharpening attention on how South Korea regulates older drivers, amid mounting evidence that traffic fatalities involving seniors are rising faster than overall accidents. Police are investigating a taxi driver in his late 70s for allegedly driving onto a pavement near Jonggak Station, one of Seouls busiest districts, during the evening rush hour on Jan 2. One pedestrian was killed, and 14 others were injured. While the exact cause of the crash has yet to be determined as of Jan 8, the authorities have ruled out alcohol or drug use. Investigators are examining whether the accident involved pedal misapplication or age-related factors affecting driving ability. The incident has revived public concern over elderly driver safety, recalling another fatal crash in July 2024 near Seouls City Hall Station, where a 69-year-old driver plowed onto a pavement, killing nine pedestrians. As South Koreas population ages,the number of elderly drivers has increased rapidly. According to data from the Korea Transportation Safety Authority, traffic accidents involving drivers aged 65 and older rose from 31,072 in 2020 to 42,369 in 2024. Their share of all traffic accidents increased from 14.8 per cent to 21.5 per cent over the same period. While the rise partly reflects demographic change, accidents involving elderly drivers have consistently recorded the highest fatality rate among all age groups, remaining more than 40 per cent higher than that of the second-highest age group throughout the 2020–2024 period. In 2024 alone, 761 people – about 30 per cent of all traffic fatalities – were killed in accidents caused by drivers aged 65 and older, exceeding their share of total accidents. Calls for stronger safety measures have grown louder, with critics pointing to possible declines in reaction time and cognitive recognition among older drivers. However, efforts to encourage voluntary licence returns have seen limited success. Seoul offers transportation credits worth 200,000 won (S$176.90) to residents aged 70 and older who surrender their drivers licences, while Incheon, Daegu and other regions provide similar incentives, including taxi vouchers. Despite these efforts, the licence return rate among drivers aged 65 and older has remained just above 2 per cent since 2020, according to National Assembly data. Analysts attribute the reluctance largely to continued economic activity among seniors and insufficient public income support. South Koreas income poverty rate for people aged 65 and older stood at 39.7 per cent in 2023, about double the OECD average. A man surnamed Kang said his parents, who live in a rural area of Jeju Island, continue to drive in their eighties because a car is essential for daily life. They want to keep working to earn income and receive agricultural subsidies, and a vehicle is necessary not only to reach their farms but also to travel into town, he said. Jeju provides elderly residents with taxi subsidies of up to 168,000 won a year, but Mr Kang said the support is insufficient to meet their mobility needs. Experts caution against blanket age limits, arguing instead for more targeted approaches. We can learn from Japan, which entered an ageing society earlier than (South) Korea, said Professor Lee Ho-geun of automotive engineering at Daeduk University. Japan requires vehicles to be equipped with systems that prevent accidental acceleration instead of braking. (South) Korea should adopt similar measures, even if subsidies are needed. Prof Lee also proposed using the national health insurance system as a framework for health-based assessments of driving eligibility beyond age-based renewal tests. Given (South) Koreas well-established national health insurance system, it could be used to more precisely assess individuals driving safety, he added. Based on those assessments, authorities could consider introducing conditional licenses, such as allowing driving only during daytime hours or on certain roads. Currently, South Korea relies largely on periodic license renewal to assess driving eligibility, with mandatory cognitive screening applied only to drivers aged 75 and older every three years.

The army had set a year-end deadline to clear non-state weaponry from southern Lebanon, which borders Israel, before moving on to other areas of the country. It said it had extended operational control over the south, except for areas still occupied by Israeli troops. The statement did not mention Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which fought a year-long war with Israel that ended in a 2024 ceasefire that stipulated that only Lebanons state security forces were allowed to carry arms. A Lebanese security source told Reuters that the statement signalled that no group would be able to launch attacks from southern Lebanon. Lebanon has faced growing pressure from the U.S. and Israel to disarm Hezbollah. Its leaders fear Israel could dramatically escalate strikes across the battered country to more quickly push Lebanons leaders to confiscate Hezbollahs arsenal. Israel and Lebanon agreed to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in 2024, ending more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. That culminated in Israeli strikes that severely weakened the Iran-backed militant group. Since then, the sides have traded accusations of violations.

On Jan 8, Washington said itwould withdraw from dozens of international and UN entities,including the worlds key climate treaty and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). Headquartered in Samoa, SPREP has supported dozens of low-lying island states to raise awareness at UN climate conferences about the threat to their survival from rising sea levels caused by climate change. The organisation employs more than 150 staff across Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and runs programmes to reduce pollution, improve warning systems for severe weather and plan for disaster response to oil spills. Ms Sefanaia Nawadra, SPREPs director-general, said the US ontributed funding and technical expertise, but other partners were expected to help it continue its work. There is a formal process that the US will need to follow to withdraw its membership of SPREP. They are a valued member of SPREP until that formal withdrawal process is completed, he said in a statement to Reuters. The impact of that will be determined as part of the details of the withdrawal process, he added. According to SPREPs annual report, its annual budget comes primarily from five donor countries, Australia, Britain, New Zealand, France and the US. China has also contributed US$200,000 (S$256,780) annually for several years. A Pacific Islands government minister, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the US move to withdraw from the organisation would negatively impact US influence in the region, where China is expanding ties. Several Pacific Island nations face new hurdles to enter the United States. Fiji, Vanuatu, Tuvalu and Tonga were listed on an 7 among countries whose nationals must pay a costly visa bond to enter the US from Jan 21.

Japan confirmed China moored and fixed a drilling vessel in the Chinese side of the two countries median line in the East China Sea, prompting Japans Coast Guard to issue a navigation warning on Jan 2, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara. The activity took place even though the boundaries of the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf in the area remain undetermined, Mr Kihara said. It is deeply regrettable that China continues its unilateral development activities and attempts to make them an established fact in these waters despite repeated protests from Japan, Mr Kihara said on Jan 8. We immediately strongly protested through diplomatic channels. Japans protest comes amid worsening relations between the two countries over comments made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in early November. The nations have been in a stalemate over comments that suggested Japan could deploy its military if China uses force to try and seize Taiwan. The controversy over the drilling vessel follows Chinas decision this week to apply new export controls and launch an anti-dumping investigation against Japan. In 2008 Japan and China reached an agreement to jointly develop gas fields in the East China Sea, but talks have stalled since then. The two countries have yet to officially agree maritime borders, raising the prospect that Beijing is looking to exert de facto control over a widening swath of the ocean by staking a claim with new structures and economic activities. Mr Kihara said on Jan 8 that Japan strongly urged the implementation of the earlier agreement. The government spokesman also said Japan is carefully assessing the impact of Chinas new anti-dumping probe into Japans production of dichlorosilane, a key chipmaking material. Shares of Japanese chipmaking material companies, including Shin-Etsu Chemical and Resonac Holdings, fell on Jan 8. Well take necessary steps as needed while cooperating with the firms under investigation, Mr Kihara said.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-protests-chinas-gas-drilling-vessel-in-east-china-sea

Prince Bank has been placed under liquidation in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) said in a statement. Prince Bank has been suspended from providing new banking services, including accepting deposits and providing credit, the statement added. The NBC said it had appointed auditor Morisonkak MKA as the liquidator. Prince Bank is a subsidiary of Chens Prince Holding Group, one of Cambodias largest conglomerates, which Washington has said served as a front for one of Asias largest transnational criminal organisations. Customers who have deposits at Prince Bank can withdraw money normally by preparing documents for withdrawal, and borrowers must continue to fulfill their obligations as normal, the NBC added. Outside a Prince Bank location in the capital Phnom Penh, among 36 branches nationwide, an AFP journalist did not see any customers on the morning of Jan 8. The bank has about a billion dollars in assets under management, according to its website. Chinese-born Chen was sanctioned by Washington and London in October for directing alleged cyber frauds run by hundreds of workers trafficked into compounds in Cambodia. The Cambodian authorities said theyarrested Chen and extradited him to Chinaon Jan 6. The operation was carried out according to a request from Chinese authorities following months of investigative cooperation, Cambodias interior ministry said. The Chinese authorities have not commented on Chens arrest since it was announced on Jan 7. The US Justice Department declined to comment on the operation. This arrest comes after months of building pressure against the Cambodian government for continuing to harbour and abet a now famous criminal actor, said Mr Jacob Daniel Sims, a transnational crime expert and visiting fellow at Harvard Universitys Asia Centre. The vast majority of the dozens of scam compounds in Cambodia operated with strong support from the government, Mr Sims told AFP, adding that a change in status quo could only happen if international pressure on the nations scam-invested oligarchs was sustained. Cambodian officials deny allegations of government involvement and say the authorities are cracking down. But Amnesty International said in 2025 that rights abuses in scam hubs were happening on a mass scale, and the governments poor response suggested its complicity. Chen faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted in the United States on wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges involving approximately 127,271 bitcoin seized by the United States, worth more than US$11 billion (S$14.12 billion) at current prices. Prince Group has denied the allegations. US prosecutors in October unsealed an indictment accusing Chen of presiding over compounds in Cambodia where trafficked workers carried out cryptocurrency fraud schemes that netted billions. Victims were targeted throughso-called pig butchering scams– investment schemes that build trust over time before stealing funds. The operations have caused billions in global losses. Scam centres across Cambodia, Myanmar and the region lure foreign nationals – many Chinese – with fake job ads, then force them under threat of violence to commit online fraud. Amnesty International has identified at least 53 scam compounds in Cambodia alone, where rights groups say criminal networks perpetrate human trafficking, forced labour, torture and slavery. Experts estimate tens of thousands of people work in the multibillion-dollar industry, some willingly and others trafficked. Since around 2015, Prince Group has operated across more than 30 countries under the guise of legitimate real estate, financial services and consumer businesses, US prosecutors have said. Chen and top executives allegedly used political influence and bribed officials in multiple countries to shield illicit operations. In Cambodia, Chen served as an adviser to Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father, former leader Hun Sen. His Cambodian nationality was revoked in December, the interior ministry said.

According to the German Embassy in London, the sheep spent about 20 minutes in the supermarket, before ewe-turning and seeing themselves out. A video of the incident sent to Osthessen News showed the sheep crowding around shelves as staff members watched. The video then cuts to the aftermath of the incident, with broken wine bottles among the damaged products on the floor. The sheep are also seen following each other out of the supermarket through the same way they entered – the front entrance. The embassy said in a Jan 7 Facebook post that the sheep, which belonged to shepherd Dieter Michler, had been part of a 500-strong herd that was being led between an industrial area and a nearby river, when the rogue group broke away and went on their baa-zarre adventure. German news website Osthessen News reported that the flock of about 50 sheep made their way through the aisles of Penny supermarket in the Burgsinn municipality of Bavaria, Germany. Pennys head of corporate communications Andreas Kramer told the news site that the sheep stayed exclusively in the checkout area of the store. Mr Kramer said that the affected area was cleaned immediately, with additional cleaning carried out the next day, including in the parking lot. All unpackaged produce was also carefully checked. For Penny, the impeccable quality of its products is clearly the top priority, said the supermarket in a statement, while declining to comment on the extent of the damage. It also added that it had no intention of pursuing claims against the shepherd, despite initial reports that it might. Mr Kramer stressed that the incident was not a planned advertising campaign.

Farmers from the Coordination Rurale union had called for protests in Paris amid anger against a free trade agreement between the EU and South American bloc Mercosur, which they fear may flood the country with cheap food imports, and the way the government is handling a cattle disease. We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment, like with Mercosur. We have been abandoned in favour of a space shuttle, an Airbus, or a car, Mr Stephane Pelletier, the deputy president of the union in Vienne, in central France, told Reuters. The protest comes days after the European Commission proposed making €45 billion (S$67.5 billion) of EU funding available earlier to farmers and agreed to cut import duties on some fertilisers in a bid to win over countries wavering in their support of Mercosur. The deal is backed by countries such as Germany and Spain and the Commission appeared to have won Italys backing, meaning it would have the votes needed to approve the trade accord with or without French support. A vote on the deal is expected on Jan 9. Farmers are also demanding an end to cow culling prompted by a series of highly contagious lumpy skin disease, which they consider excessive and advocate for vaccination instead. Dozens of tractors were parked on the Seine bank below the Eiffel Tower and blockading some accesses to the city centre from the Peripherique, such as at Porte dAuteuil.

REUTERS/Gaby Oraa","['Latin America', 'Venezuela', 'Elections']","NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 8 - U.S. President Donald Trumps muscular moves in Venezuela and Argentina are adding to a rightward shift across Latin America in a pivotal election year, making foreign cash more likely to flow to the region as investors anticipate market-friendly reforms. The U.S. removal of President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend sent Venezuelas defaulted debt soaring, while Trumps gamble last year to bolster Argentinas Javier Milei - an ideological ally - with a financial backstop of up to $40 billion paid off when Mileis party did well in crucial midterm elections. In a different era, Trumps interventions may have sparked more of a backlash against brazen foreign meddling. And while not everyone in Latin America has welcomed his moves, reaction has been relatively muted at a time of a broader rightward political shift that investors say will boost the regions financial assets as they anticipate market-friendly changes. What weve found historically in Latin America is that things tend to go in waves and trends together, said Robert Koenigsberger, chief investment officer and managing partner at Gramercy. It clearly seems that the current trend in Latin America is from left to right. That perception, he said, has made investors more comfortable adding exposure as they focus on expected fiscal consolidation and regulatory reforms across the region. A REGIONAL SHIFT The willingness to add exposure reflects a view that Latin America has moved as a block in regional cycles, with political shifts often reinforcing one another rather than playing out country by country. Recent election wins in Ecuador, Argentina and Chile have seen a shift towards right-wing parties, underpinning rallies in regional equities, currencies and bonds over the past year. Markets have also been buoyed by a general trend towards orthodox monetary policies and fiscal discipline, even in those countries led by leftist leaders like Brazil and Mexico. Brazils real and Mexicos peso were among the best performing emerging market currencies in 2025, while stocks in Colombia, Peru and Chile crowded the leaderboard for equity gains. The ousting of Maduro was being taken positively by markets, said Graham Stock, an emerging markets strategist at RBC BlueBay. If anything, it reinforces our expectation that youre going to see a shift to more market-friendly governments in Latin America, he said. ELECTIONS IN VIEW After Latin America outperformed many emerging market peers last year, investors are watching a packed electoral calendar in 2026, which will include elections in Colombia, Peru and later in the year, Brazil. Eileen Gavin, head of sovereign analysis at Verisk Maplecroft, said Colombia was particularly exposed to potential fallout from neighboring Venezuela as it heads to congressional elections in March and a presidential race in May. Leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who has clashed with Trump and was hit with U.S. sanctions back in October, cannot run for reelection. The pressure on the elections will be to tilt towards the right, and for bondholders, thats a risk upside, Gavin said, adding that Venezuelas turmoil could also weigh on Peru, Panama and Cuba through changes to migration and trade. Perus April 12 presidential election seems open, with at least 34 hopefuls registered to compete, and nearly half of voters without a preferred candidate, according to a poll late last year. In Brazil, meanwhile, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva currently leads most polls as he seeks a fourth term in office in a vote set for October. Whoever wins, they will need to deal with Trump, set to be in office until January 2029. The more the U.S. puts pressure on these countries, the more theyre likely to bend to American will, which, in the case of Latin America, means more pro-market policies, said Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research. Investors at Citi noted that the negative response to Trumps Venezuelan operation had been limited. In the short term, the action has not generated a rally around the Latin American flag, with many voices welcoming the move, Citis Donato Guarino said in a note, adding that the bank remained long on Venezuelan credit. RESOURCE EXTRACTION COMPANIES COULD BENEFIT Indeed, even some leftist presidents have sought to cut deals or appease Trump. Colombias government has emphasized in recent days it would cooperate with Washington to fight drug trafficking. Leftist leaders are probably constantly looking over their shoulders, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. As regional governments seek investment that fits U.S. strategic priorities, multinational companies involved in infrastructure development and resource extraction were likely to be among the main beneficiaries, Jacobsen said. BCAs Papic also predicted natural resources-linked assets should outperform, as well as banks. The Latin American private sector has deleveraged, and there is potential for financial institutions to benefit as well, he added. Broadly constructive on Latin American assets, he warned that investor enthusiasm hinged on Washington avoiding an overly aggressive posture, however. It would be a mistake for the U.S. to rely purely on the heavy-handed approach, he said, arguing that it could yet trigger a backlash rooted in sovereignty concerns. Hopefully the (Trump) administration can find some middle ground. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/investors-bullish-on-latin-america-after-us-move-on-venezuelas-maduro

A NASA spokeswoman said the astronaut, who she did not identify out of medical privacy, was in a stable condition on the orbiting laboratory. Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11s mission, the spokeswoman said in a statement on the night of Jan 7. NASA said in an earlier statement it was monitoring a medical concern with a crew member that arose the afternoon of Jan 7. Returning the four-person Crew-11 crew would be a rare consequence of a medical issue aboard the ISS, where astronauts typically live in six to eight-month rotations with access to basic medical equipment and medications for some types of emergencies. The four-person Crew-11 crew includes US astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They have been on the space station since launching from Florida in August and were scheduled to return around May 2026. Mr Fincke, the stations designated commander, and Ms Cardman, assigned as flight engineer, were scheduled to conduct a 6.5-hour spacewalk on Jan 8 to install hardware outside the station. NASAs astronaut corps regards medical situations on the ISS as closely held secrets, and astronauts rarely acknowledge or describe publicly their medical conditions. Spacewalks are arduous and risky missions that require months of training, involving bulky spacesuits and carefully coordinated instructions while tethered to the ISS. NASA in 2024 called off a planned spacewalk last-minute because an astronaut experienced spacesuit discomfort.

The last Russia-US nuclear treaty is about to expire. What happens next?,"Jan 08, 2026, 01:21 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 02:39 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d176d85790e02a7740eab5c8c3a3f520353c2fafc227b8cc35dbb37843570322,US President George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev exchanging documents after signing the START arms reduction treaty in 1991.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['United States', 'Russia', 'Nuclear weapons']","LONDON-Even at the height of their Cold War nuclear rivalry, the US and the Soviet Union thrashed out a series of treaties to keep the arms race from spiralling out of control. Though they agreed on little else, leaders in Moscow and Washington saw value in talks – from 1969 until long after the Soviet collapse in 1991 – to create a stable and predictable framework limiting the size of their nuclear arsenals. Now the last US-Russia nuclear treaty, New START, is just weeks away from expiring on Feb 5, and what comes next is uncertain. The two countries, preoccupied by the war in Ukraine, have not held any talks on a successor treaty. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that both parties should agree for a further 12 months to adhere to the New START limits, which cap the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 on each side. US President Donald Trump has yet to deliver a formal response, and Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Mr Putins offer. On the one hand, it would buy time to chart a way forward, while sending a political signal that both sides want to preserve a vestige of arms control. On the other hand, it would allow Russia to keep developing weapons systems outside the scope of New START, including its Burevestnik cruise missile and Poseidon torpedo. Former US defence planner Greg Weaver noted in a paper for the Atlantic Council that Russia had refused since 2023 to accept mutual inspections that would provide Washington with assurances that Moscow is still complying with the treaty. Agreeing to Mr Putins proposal would also send a message to China that the US would not build up its strategic nuclear forces in response to Chinas fast-growing nuclear arsenal, Mr Weaver added. This signal would likely undermine the prospects for bringing China to the arms control negotiating table, indicating to China that US forces will remain limited regardless of what China does. Russia and the US have estimated total inventories of 5,459 and 5,177 nuclear warheads respectively, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Between them, they account for nearly 87 per cent of all such warheads globally. China, however, has accelerated its nuclear programme, and now has an estimated 600 warheads. The Pentagon estimates it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. While Mr Trump has stated he wants to pursue denuclearisation with both Russia and China, Beijing says it is unreasonable and unrealistic to ask it to join three-way nuclear disarmament talks with countries whose arsenals are so much larger. Further complicating the prospects for global arms control, Russia says the nuclear forces of NATO members Britain and France should also be up for negotiation – something those countries reject. Mr Nikolai Sokov, a former Soviet and Russian arms negotiator, said in a telephone interview that trying to forge a new multilateral nuclear treaty in this environment was almost a dead end. It will take forever. Mr Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, said one alternative would be for Russia and the US to work out a successor to New START that would include flexible warhead limits to take account of the Chinese build-up. But a faster and more straightforward course would be for countries to focus on steps to reduce the significant risk of a nuclear war breaking out by accident. Right now, for example, only Russia and the US have a 24/7 hotline for use in a nuclear crisis, whereas no European capital, not even the NATO headquarters, can actually communicate with Moscow. There is no dedicated line, Mr Sokov said. If parties at the same time also begin negotiations on arms control, that would be great. But you need to understand that the next treaty will be very, very complex... It will take time. So the number one priority is risk reduction and confidence building, he added.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/the-last-russia-us-nuclear-treaty-is-about-to-expire-what-happens-next

No official date has been set to reopen the embassy, according to people involved, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. When asked about the possibility of reopening the embassy by reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan 4, President Donald Trump said, were thinking about it. A senior State Department official said they are making preparations to allow for a reopening should Mr Trump make that decision. The timing underscores how rapidly Washington is seeking to reset relations afterMs Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as Acting Presidenton Jan 5, just days after a US air strike resulted inthe arrest of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Already, state oil company PDVSA said on Jan 7 that it is in talks to sell a large volume of crude to the US. The hulking American embassy sits atop a lush green hill in the eastern Caracas neighbourhood of Valle Arriba. Spanning the size of two football fields, the building is visible from much of the city. It was inaugurated in 1995, after a four-year construction process that cost nearly US$13 million (S$16.7 million). At its height in the mid-2000s, nearly 500 employees and contractors from as many as nine US agencies – including the Drug Enforcement Administration and Department of Homeland Security – worked there. A large US flag used to fly in front of the compound until the US suspended operations in 2019. That was when Mr Trump, during his first term, said Maduros re-election the year prior was illegitimate and instead recognised opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido as the countrys president. Responsibilities in Venezuela have been handled by the US embassy in neighbouring Colombia since.

The drama escalates a row between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the most powerful countries in the oil-rich Gulf. Mr Zubaidi had failed to show up in Riyadh for crisis talks over turmoil in southern Yemen on Jan 7. The separatists said he had been asked to go to Saudi Arabia under threat. The Saudi claim that the UAE helped him escape raises the stakes in a crisis that erupted in December when the separatists swept through southern Yemen and reached the border with Saudi Arabia. The fast-moving crisis in Yemens southhas caused a rift between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the two most powerful countries in the oil-rich Gulf, fracturing a coalition headed by Yemens internationally recognised government, which is battling the Iran-backed Houthis. The close US allies have sharp differences over a wide range of volatile issues across the Middle East – from geopolitics to oil output – which burst out into the open with the crisis in Yemen. In a statement on Jan 8, the coalition said Mr Zubaidi and others accompanying him on the plane to Mogadishu from Somaliland were under the supervision of UAE officers and waited an hour before flying to a military airport in Abu Dhabi. The coalition did not clearly say if Mr Zubaidi was still aboard en route to the UAE capital. If his presence in the UAE capital is confirmed, it could anger the Saudis, who pressured the UAE to rein separatists after their advance through south Yemen. The UAE, which withdrew its remaining forces from Yemen, has called for de-escalation in the country, reeling from one of the worlds worst humanitarian crises caused by the civil war. There was no immediate comment from the UAE or the Southern Transitional Council (STC) that Mr Zubaidi heads. The STC is a separatist group that is backed by the UAE. The United Arab Emirates has pursued an assertive foreign policy and carved out its own sphere of influence across the Middle East and Africa, a strategy thrown into the spotlight after the rare military escalation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen. The plane from Mogadishu turned off its identification system over the Gulf of Oman, before turning it back on 10 minutes prior to arrival at (Al Reef) military airport in Abu Dhabi, the coalition said. The coalition statement also mentioned by name the UAE officer whose help Mr Zubaidi had sought. A day earlier, the coalition said Mr Zubaidi had failed to board a flight to Riyadh for talks and his fate was unclear, clouding efforts to contain a military escalation that erupted in December 2025. After Mr al-Zubaidis unexplained absence from the Riyadh talks, his group said he was overseeing military and security operations in the southern port city of Aden. The aircraft was of a type similar to those frequently used in conflict zones on the routes of countries such as Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia, it added. Saudi Arabia and the UAE first intervened in Yemen after the Houthis seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa in 2014. The UAE joined the Saudi-backed coalition the following year in support of the internationally recognised government. The STC was set up in 2017 with UAE backing and eventually joined the government coalition, which controls southern and eastern Yemen.

My conduct defied everything that I believe about marriage,Yanceywrote in a statement published by the magazine Christianity Today, where he was a contributor for decades. It was also totally inconsistent with my faith and my writings and caused deep pain for her husband and both of our families. Yancey, 76, said the extramarital relationship had lasted eight years, and that he would not share other details out of respect for the other family. His books have sold more than 20 million copies in 49 languages, according to his official biography. Former US president Jimmy Carter, an evangelical Christian and a fellow Georgian, once named Yancey as his favourite modern author. Yancey was not a moral crusader or a political brawler. He wrote about the scandal of grace, the notion that Gods forgiveness and love are extended not only to the undeserving but also to those who in fact deserve the opposite. He is best known for two books he published in the 1990s, The Jesus I Never Knew and Whats So Amazing AboutGrace? Both reached a wide audience and were named Christian Book of the Year by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association, which presented Yancey with an award for lifetime contributions to the church and society in 2023. Yanceys writings about grace and Jesus are in the subconscious of evangelical Christians in ways that are hard to overstate, saidDr Ed Stetzer, dean of the Talbot School of Theology. This was the guy whose platform was built on sincerity and honesty and wrestling with hard things and being a person of character. Yancey began his writing career in the 1970s writing for Campus Life, a magazine for Christian young people that he eventually led. At Christianity Today, he wrote a popular back-page column for 26 years starting in 1983, a period in which the magazine became arguably the most influential publication in mainstream evangelicalism, before the Trump era scrambled hierarchies of clout among many Christian leaders and institutions.

(Jan 6) and for sharing her experiences of foreign biennales. Whether one agrees with her views or not, Ms Ongs candour should be welcomed if we are to cultivate a more rigorous, open and self-reflective art discourse in Singapore –one that can accommodate disagreement and critical debate. While I am grateful for the efforts of the artists, curators and the organising team behind the Singapore Biennale, a key question remains: Who is the Biennale for? I was bewildered by the lack of clarity in the wall text explaining the works. If an art biennale funded by tax dollars is intended for the general public, and not only for those who are art-trained, should the explanatory text not be clear, concise and free of confusing jargon? As I moved through the different Biennale venues, I often found myself intrigued by the interesting works on display, only to feel further confused after reading the accompanying wall text. I found that many were either laden with art jargon or phrased so broadly that it was difficult to extract any real meaning on first reading. While this may be acceptable in a more academic context, it is far less helpful for works intended for a general audience. Clear phrasing does not equate to dumbing down an artwork. On the contrary, it takes intellectual acuity to distil complex ideas to their essence and communicate them in an accessible way. Doing so also signals a courageous openness to debate and discussion. Put simply, the more people understand your ideas, the more likely they are to challenge and meaningfully engage with them. Clear wall text for public art exhibitions is relatively low-hanging fruit in the broader journey towards more widespread art education within our population, and I hope that our public art institutions keep this in mind for future presentations.

The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a voluntary retirement savings scheme that complements the Central Provident Fund (CPF) system. It already offers generous tax benefits to encourage savings. Contributions to SRS are eligible for tax relief, and when withdrawals are made on or after the applicable statutory retirement age, only 50 per cent of the withdrawn amount is subject to tax. Under the current framework, SRS members with no other taxable income may withdraw up to $40,000 per year tax-free. Over the 10-year withdrawal period, an SRS member can withdraw up to $400,000 without incurring any tax. This feature ensures that SRS provides meaningful tax concessions, while maintaining consistency with Singapores progressive tax system. Those who prefer longer streams of income may consider topping up their CPF accounts to obtain higher lifelong payouts through CPF LIFE, or purchase life annuities using SRS monies. Life annuities are exempt from the 10-year rule, as they provide lifetime payouts, which other dividend-paying investments may not. Over the years, the Government has made refinements to the SRS, including increased contribution caps and more flexible withdrawals in the form of investments. The Ministry of Finance continues to review the SRS regularly, taking into account demographic trends, retirement adequacy and fiscal sustainability.

Should AI be allowed to resurrect the dead?,"Jan 07, 2026, 06:00 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 07:22 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d84483db30910cb3dbb6190012e002eda09c61bd92c02364fec484df64721e4c,There are important ethical questions about whose consent is required for the creation of a deathbot.PHOTO: PIXABAY,"['AI chatbot', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mental health']","When Roro (not her real name) lost her mother to cancer, the grief felt bottomless. In her mid-20s and working as a content creator in China, she was haunted by the unfinished nature of their relationship. Their bond had always been complicated – shaped by unspoken resentments and a childhood in which care was often followed closely by criticism. After her mothers death, Roro found herself unable to reconcile the messiness of their past with the silence that followed. She shared her struggles with her followers on the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, hoping to help them with their own journeys of healing. Her writing caught the attention of the operators of artificial intelligence (AI) character generator Xingye, who invited her to create an AI version of her mother as a public chatbot. I wrote about my mother, documenting all the important events in her life and then creating a story where she was resurrected in an AI world, Roro told me through a translator. You write out the major life events that shape the protagonists personality, and you define their behavioural patterns. Once youve done that, the AI can generate responses on its own. After it generates outputs, you can continue adjusting it based on what you want it to be. During the training process, Roro began to reinterpret her past with her mother, altering elements of their story to create a more idealised figure – a gentler and more attentive version of her. This helped her to process the loss, resulting in the creation of Xia, a public chatbot with which her followers could also interact. After its release, Roro received a message from a friend saying her mum would be so proud of her. I broke down in tears, Roro said. It was incredibly healing. Thats why I wanted to create something like this – not just to heal myself, but also to provide others with something that might say the words they needed to hear. As I recount in my new book Love Machines, Roros story reflects the new possibilities technology has opened for people to cope with grief through conversational AI. Large language models can be trained using personal material, including e-mails, texts, voice notes and social media posts, to mimic the conversational style of a deceased loved one. These deathbots or griefbots are one of the more controversial use cases of AI chatbots. Some are text-based, while others also depict the person through a video avatar. US grieftech company You, Only Virtual, for example, creates a chatbot from conversations (both spoken and written) between the deceased and one of their living friends or relatives, producing a version of how they appeared to that particular person. While some deathbots remain static representations of a person at the time of their death, others are given access to the internet and can evolve through conversations. You, Only Virtuals chief executive Justin Harrison argues it would not be an authentic version of a deceased person if their AI could not keep up with the times and respond to new information. But this raises a host of difficult questions about whether estimating the development of a human personality is even possible with current technology, and what effect interacting with such an entity could have on a deceased persons loved ones. Xingye, the platform on which Roro created her late mothers chatbot, is one of the key prompts for proposed new regulations from Chinas Cyberspace Administration, the national internet content regulator and censor, which seek to reduce the potential emotional harm of human-like interactive AI services. Deathbots fundamentally change the process of mourning because, unlike seeing old letters or photos of the deceased, interacting with generative AI can introduce new and unexpected elements into the grieving process. For Roro, creating and interacting with an AI version of her mother felt surprisingly therapeutic, allowing her to articulate feelings she never voiced and achieve a sense of closure. But not everyone shares this experience, including London-based journalist Lottie Hayton, who lost both her parents suddenly in 2022 and wrote about her experiences recreating them with AI. She said she found the simulations uncanny and distressing: The technology was not quite there, and the clumsy imitations felt as if they cheapened her real memories rather than honoured them. There are also important ethical questions about whose consent is required for the creation of deathbots, where they would be allowed to be displayed and what impact they could have on other family members and friends. Does one relatives desire to create a symbolic companion who helps them make sense of their loss give them the right to display a deathbot publicly on their social media account, where others will see it – potentially exacerbating their grief? What happens when different relatives disagree about whether a parent or partner would have wanted to be digitally resurrected at all? The companies creating these deathbots are not neutral grief counsellors; they are commercial platforms driven by familiar incentives around growth, engagement and data harvesting. This creates a tension between what is emotionally healthy for users and what is profitable for firms. A deathbot that people visit compulsively, or struggle to stop talking to, may be a business success but a psychological trap. These risks do not mean we should ban all experiments with AI-mediated grief or dismiss the genuine comfort some people, like Roro, find in them. But they do mean that decisions about resurrecting the dead cannot be left solely to start-ups and venture capital. The industry needs clear rules about consent, limits on how posthumous data can be used, and design standards that prioritise psychological well-being over endless engagement. Ultimately, the question is not just whether AI should be allowed to resurrect the dead, but also who gets to do so, on what terms, and at what cost. James Muldoon is associate professor in management at the University of Essex.

The most surprising thing about Netflixs smash-hit culinary survival series Culinary Class Wars may not be the food or the final rankings, but the stories of each chef. Season 2s beloved judges and the white team - the elite figures who helped shape South Koreas contemporary culinary scene - make their on-screen entrances like kings. Yet behind the status and the Michelin credentials is something far messier and more cinematic than any edited competition show: a motley crew of runaways, war veterans, dropouts, and even accidental TV champions whose applications began after getting drunk. If Culinary Class Wars has a face, its Anh Sung-jae, the polite yet sharp-tongued judge whose intense gravitas defines the series. The owner of South Koreas sole three-Michelin-star restaurant, Mosu, Anh anchors the series with a well-mannered demeanor and piercing critiques. However, before reaching the summit of South Koreas culinary world, he led a chaotic life. Born in South Korea and raised in California, Anhs youth was defined by immigrant survival. His family struggled, moving between small businesses such as sock shops, T-shirt stores and an American-Chinese restaurant, with Anh helping before and after school. As a young adult, he enlisted in the US Army and served four years as a maintenance technician that included a yearlong deployment to Iraq. My assignment wasnt to fire a gun, but to search for weapons in Saddam Husseins bunkers and take them into the desert to detonate them, he revealed via an interview. He kept the deployment a secret from his family, an omission that earned him a slap from his furious grandmother upon his return, Anh added. Upon discharge, the transition to civilian life was equally impulsive; after spotting students in chef whites at Le Cordon Bleu, he abandoned plans to become a Porsche mechanic and enrolled on a whim. He began washing dishes, gradually moving up the restaurant ranks to eventually master the line at one of the US most-respected restaurants, The French Laundry and ultimately launching the historic Mosu in 2015. From war machines to haute cuisine, Anhs career has been an odyssey. Fan favorite Choi Kang-rok, beloved for his shy, anime-loving, otaku-like demeanor, also has an unusually unplanned career arc, one rarely seen even in Japanese comics. He began as a drummer, but after failing his music entrance exams, he enrolled in college to take Spanish studies. But he dropped out, drifting between part-time kitchen jobs to pay for his expensive music gear. It was during this period that he discovered the manga Mr. Sushi King, reportedly the turning point that inspired him to officially start a career as a restaurateur. His early ventures were failures. Two sushi shops folded, leaving him broke and disillusioned. He lived in a Buddhist temple before moving to Japan to attend the prestigious Tsuji Culinary Institute, driven by a tenacious desire to break through in the culinary world. Even then, success proved elusive, and he retreated into a salaried job at a tuna trading company to settle his debts. It was only during a night of heavy drinking that he impulsively applied for Season 2 of MasterChef Korea. It was no drunken mistake: He won the series. Today, Choi stands as one of the shows most admired figures, his rise testament to the idea that talent will survive misfortune and emerge in time. Son Jong-won, the handsome heartthrob of the season, appears to embody elegant, controlled excellence, but his volatile past suggests otherwise. A valedictorian at an elite private school, Son seemed destined for a life of conventional success. On paper, his future was set, winning a scholarship at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Yet a visit to the prestigious Culinary Institute of America sparked an obsession that changed everything. After being captivated by students in crisp chef whites mastering their craft, Son made a decisive shift - abandoning his original major to enroll at the institute a and pursue a culinary career in the United States. He later returned to South Korea to helm LAmant Secret, earning a Michelin star within two years. He would then go on to take over Eatanic Garden at Josun Palace, which soon followed suit. Sons bold decision to walk away from a secure future proved decisive, shaping him into one of the countrys most beloved star chefs. Lim Sung-geun, the gruff, larger-than-life figure became one of the most popular memes of Culinary Class Wars Season 2, came to cooking not by choice but by running away from home. Having run away from home at 15, Lim survived by sleeping in kitchens and washing dishes. Working throughout his teenage years and quickly recognised for his talent, Lee became a head chef at just 19 - a self-taught master who practiced in secret at dawn, hiding the spoiled ingredients he used for training. His continued career in Korean cuisine is defined by a resilience that seems almost unreal: The night he achieved a tearful victory on the TV show Korean Food Battle 3 was the same night his three-story restaurant completely burned to the ground - events that unexpectedly cemented his status as a rockstar chef in the country. Perhaps the most striking presence on Culinary Class Wars is the Venerable Seonjae - serene, unshakable and dressed in monastic robes. But her origin story has a twist: She was a devout Protestant at first. Born into a Protestant family, she revealed she had attended mission schools, dawn prayers and Sunday teaching during her youth - a level of devotion rare even among committed Christians today. Her drastic conversion to Buddhism came during a retreat at Yongjusa Temple, alongside a spiritual awakening that reframed her idea of sacrifices and love. Ordained at 25, she was eventually confronted by a systemic failure: The death of a fellow monk from malnutrition, which led her on a quest to study Buddhist culinary practices. Her pursuit of an answer led her to publish South Koreas first academic thesis on temple cuisine and establish the Seonjae Temple Food Culture Research Institute.

"Peace, love and Yeti: 5 ways to interpret Pantones colour of the year, Cloud Dancer, for 2026","Jan 08, 2026, 01:50 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 01:50 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/040d4879729164c72953e4db200b9f78a4dc7d02bc08d6d94e12e2184c315036,"Pantone said Cloud Dancer, also known as Pantone 11-4201, has an aerated presence which acted as a whisper of calm and peace in a noisy world.PHOTO: FERRAGAMO, BOTTEGA VENETA, IN GOOD COMPANY","['Shopping', 'Luxury brands', 'Fashion designers']","SINGAPORE – Colour authority Pantone made its most controversial prediction yet when it named white the colour of 2026. Since 1999, the firm behind the universal colour glossary, the Pantone Matching System, has tipped one shade that everyone will be wearing, using or generally coveting each year. Whereas past picks tended more colourful, like 2025s Mocha Mousse or 2020s Classic Blue,its money this time is onCloud Dancer. Pantone 11-4201 is, however you slice it, a standard-issue white. Its all-purposeness has split observers. The colour symbolising light in the cosmic battle between good and evil is a semiotic Swiss Army knife. One can plausibly read into it elitism for its association with ivory, a coded promotion of white eugenics or, in its safe blankness, a kind of timid fence-sitting in a politically divisive world. Others see the relatable yen for calm or a clean slate. The airy choice is a conscious statement of simplification, said Pantone Colour Institute executive director Leatrice Eiseman in a statement that referred to a cacophonous and overwhelming world. It also mixes well with all other colours, supporting rather than shouting, states the institutes vice-president Laurie Pressman in an article on the firms website. Local fashion designer and stylist Josiah Chua welcomes the pick, which he says feels like a collective reset. After seasons saturated with brights and high-impact hues, this soft white washes everything back to calm, allowing space to breathe, reflect and begin again, he says. However you lean, the debate over whites abstract properties feels strikingly of the moment. As chief fashion critic of The New York Times Vanessa Friedman put it:So maybe Pantone got the choice right, even if the reasons they named (calm, restoration) were not entirely convincing? The colour institutes yearly bets have a mixed track record. For every hit like 2020s perceptive blue – that, in its likeness to the lurid blue of Big Tech logos, presciently distilled the onlineness of the pandemic year – there have been misses like 2024s Peach Fuzz, which was drowned out by the brash lime green of British musician Charli XCXs hyperpop album Brat that inspired the years revelrous Brat summer. But given that most already own pieces in classic white, the practical cost of hopping on the Pantone wagon is nil. It is also a helpful canvas, never boring when styled with confidence, says Chua. Accents of your favourite brights, metallics or subtle stipples of colour can be woven in through accessories, embellishments or unexpected detailing, he adds. The heap of associations bound up with white also means it is ripe for personal interpretation. In the spirit of new year, new me, Pantones chosen shade is a pliant springboard for a range of fresh personas one might be tempted to try on in 2026. With Cloud Dancer and its Pantone trademark set to appear on everything from apparel and Motorola smartphones to Play-Doh and Mandarin Oriental hotels, here are five style tropes to play with, inspired by the potential new colour for our times. In its vanilla connotations, white can feel like a safe choice. But the colour of frost can carry attitude too. There is something autocratic about a stark white, which makes the wearer feel aloof and dramatic. That kind of coolness might be read as unsociable, but its hardness is attractive too,and somewhat tempered by the wearers vulnerability to stains. It is difficult to keep up a tough exterior after all. The chilly glamour of an all-white or mostly-white look is appropriate for those seeking to steel themselves in the new year. It telegraphs discipline and sureness, with a side of villainya la the White Witch of Narnia. The wintry sentiment can also serve as a reminder to take the temperature down in 2026 and avoid hot-headed reactiveness. Play with textures to elevate an all-white look. Chua suggests flourishes like white feather trims at the cuffs or devore (a technique used on velvet) fabrics. Ferragamo High-Slit Pencil Skirt, $1,520 A classic silhouette disrupted by dangerous slits. This mascarpone-hued pencil skirt is cut from pure virgin wool and features the Italian brands signature Hug buckle that accents the waistline.

This ensemble from Bottega Veneta was one of the 11 it presented. It mixes heavy and light fabrics, with a fluttering, asymmetric hem. Info:Available from end-February atbottegaveneta.com Reconciliation as a means of leaving behind quarrels past can feel particularly appealing in the new year. Those looking to retract their claws can draw from the universal symbol of peace, the white dove, by going for softer, inviting textures. Linen, knits or furry, swaddling materials spring to mind. Silky whites can add an adult element, to give pacifism without wimpiness. Colour-match with gentle blues and greys, as recommended by Pressman on Pantones website, to convey clear skies and the tranquillity of choosing peace. Rye Open Back Draped Funnel Neck Topin white, $169 This top is made of fluid acetate, a silk-like material with a natural sheen. The ties at the back can be cinched into a bow or left hanging for a more relaxed look.

Info:Available at 01-34 Raffles City, 252 North Bridge Road Bridal white can come with baggage, like the oppressive ideal of purity. But the wedding gown with the drama of ceremony also happens to be an enduring object of cultural fascination, with high-fashion designers traditionally closing their fashion shows with a bridal look. These can be subversive, like the feat of performance art that closed Alexander McQueens Spring/Summer 1999 show: a bouncy white dress worn by supermodel Shalom Harlow standing on a rotating platform as robotic arms spray-painted it with streaks of black and yellow – a cultural milestone in fashion history. Still, the conventional idea of a blushing bride, excited and vulnerable as everyone in love is, can feel like an uplifting costume for those looking to lean into that mood. In love with the years possibility? White looks great when silky and pretty. Lace accents or a pleated garment could add that touch of romance to your wardrobe. Comme des Garcons Rose Applique Pinafore, $845 A dress serving a strong dose of avant-garde femininity. The rose appliques across the bodice are applied by hand, featuring the Japanese brands signature deconstructed approach to romantic elements.

Info:Available at B1-06 Ion Orchard, 2 Orchard Turn, andingoodcompany.asia The pristine focus of the scientist is embodied in the white laboratory coat, whose corporate form is the dress shirt. Running with this feeling in the new year could be good for those seeking to hunker down on a professional goal. Think of it as wearing your ambition on your sleeve. This could look like a straightforward crisp white button-down or dressy shirt that you make your new uniform. But for those afraid of looking too clinical, the key lies in texture and silhouette, advises Chua. He suggests blending opposites, like layering sheer pieces against structured ones, pairing matt finishes with lustre, or contrasting fluid forms with architectural cuts. With Nothing Underneath The Boyfriend shirt, $168 This essential white shirt is made of fine poplin for a smooth finish. It is tailored for women, flattering the collarbones and featuring a slightly dropped shoulder. Good for work and play.

If you are done with being a pipsqueak, lean into the untamed idea of the Abominable Snowman. This could look like incorporating furry accents into your white-based outfits, through fuzzy tops and hairy bags or shoes. It could also inspire bigger and bolder details or silhouettes, which is one way to channel the Yeti and leave a larger impression.

She has appeared in TV shows such as the Channel 5 drama 128 Circle (2019) and Channel 8 fantasy Fixing Fate (2025), as well as the Chinese New Year movies I Want To Be Boss (2025) and the upcoming A Good Fortune (2026), which opens in Singapore cinemas on Jan 29. Wong, who is in her early 40s, is also among the voice talents featured in the immersive virtual-reality experience VR60 – Experience Singapores Timeless Story, currently on at creative lifestyle destination New Bahrus Lawn until March 29. This experience, which can be paid for using SG Culture Pass credits, uses storytelling, music and technology to bring Singapores cultural heritage to life. A descendant of the founder of Tai Thean Kew Circus, which operated here from the 1930s to 1980s, Wong has written a book on the circus history, Life Beyond The Big Top (2016), and is working on a short film based on it. I am very close to my grandmother, Madam Sze Ling Fen, who used to be an acrobat and tightrope walker with the Tai Thean Kew Circus. I grew up watching her rehearse and sew costumes at home for shows, well into her 50s. Now at 92, with diabetes and knee problems, she prefers not to venture too far from her neighbourhood. A fun weekend for me would be taking her out of her comfort zone to what I call trendy experiences, which are new, fun and exciting. I want her to enjoy her golden years, and see Singapore in its glory today. For her most recent birthday in September 2025, we had dinner at the Haidilao restaurant at Plaza Singapura with my mother and younger sister one weekend. My grandmother typically does not tolerate the hustle and bustle of town, saying everything is loud and expensive. But I talked her into experiencing the wonderful service and fun Hadilao is known for. I asked the restaurant in advance for the full Haidilao birthday experience. So, the staff wished her happy birthday upon arrival and decorated our private corner with balloons and glowing lights. One staff performed the noodle dance – stretching dough and twirling it into noodles – to Gangnam Style (2012) by South Korean rapper Psy. When it was time to sing the birthday song, the staff wheeled in a birthday cake with a glowing LED board, all the while clapping and singing. My grandmother was entertained by the celebration and said it was such a thrill. Given her circus career, I also take her to catch circus acts whenever they perform here on weekends, such as Cirque du Soleil – Kooza in 2017 and Lai Frisque Yi Xia Leh! in 2024. I also plan to take her to see Kooza again when it returns in February 2026. Seeing her smile makes me happy, and is the best part of my weekends.

Most prominently featured is the peach, an emblem of sweetness and longevity that also cheekily mirrors the natural fullness of the feminine body celebrated in PBK silhouettes. Gold ingots, reimagined as seeds, symbolise abundance and prosperity. Leaves, woven through the print, symbolise renewal, vitality and a life that blooms continuously. And fans, traditionally linked with grace and nobility, represent elegance and good fortune.

Fresh Air: New management for multi-concept food venue Air CCCC in Dempsey,"Jan 08, 2026, 12:59 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:13 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1e4828a6da2e7112d820e1d61ff95c24f42205d3de2fcf6e14e9e9edf646cf7f,Chefs Will Goldfarb (left) and Matt Orlando in the kitchen at Air in Dempsey in a 2023 file photo.PHOTO: ST FILE,"['Food and drink', 'Restaurants/Eateries', 'Chefs', 'Sustainable living/development', 'Food and beverage sector']","SINGAPORE – Changes are afoot at Air CCCC, the multi-concept food venture in the Dempsey lifestyle enclave. Ebb & Flow, the restaurant group that runs restaurants such as Willow and Carlitos, is stepping in to take over the day-to-day running of the place. The founders – American chefs Will Goldfarb and Matt Orlando, and Mr Ronald Akili, co-founder of the Potato Head hospitality brand in Bali – are still expected to be involved in the business, says Mr Lim Kian Chun, 33, chief executive of Ebb & Flow. Air CCCC, which opened in 2024, is short for Awareness, Impact and Responsibility – Circular Campus and Cooking Club. It occupies a 4,000 sq m complex in Dempsey that used to be a clubhouse for civil servants. The venue, which cost a seven-figure sum to set up, offers accessible luxury. Chef Orlando, former head chef of Noma, ran Amass in Copenhagen for nine years before starting Air. He has returned to Copenhagen. Chef Goldfarb runs Room4Dessert and Powder Room in Bali, and is returning to run these businesses and other projects. The food at Air is acontinuation of what chef Orlando did at Amass – coaxing deliciousness from what others might throw away. At the restaurant, banana skins were used to make caramel and fish bones were transformed into noodles. That sustainability thread will continue when Ebb & Flow takes over the running of the venue in late January 2026. Mr Lim tells The Straits Times the place will continue as Air for five to six months before it morphs into a new concept in the second half of 2026. What shape that will take is still up in the air. It will be something that really stays true to the vision of Will and Matt, and the ethos that they have, he says. I think were lucky that theres such a great platform here. We have had a lot of talks about whats important to us in terms of sustainability, product quality, locally sourced ingredients, great cooking and accessible experiences. Ebb & Flow already has a presence in Dempsey. It recently opened Curlys, a grocery store and restaurant that sources products and ingredients from regional small and independent producers. Chef Goldfarb, 50, adds: What we both care about, and one of the reasons Im so confident in Ebb & Flow coming in, is we know theyre committed to providing and caring for guests in such a meaningful way; sharing this sense of hospitality and taking care of people, which at the end of the day is what restaurants are all about. The expansive Air space includes a garden with fruit, vegetables and herbs that leads to a lawn area that can accommodate up to 350 people. The two-storey building seats 45 on each level, and includes research space and room for cooking classes and talks. The management change has been in the works for a few months, they both say. Chef Goldfarb adds: Its a small industry so we luckily found ourselves around a small table. Mr Lim feels Singapore diners are looking for the same thing theyve always been looking for, which is good hospitality, good food and a sense of community. And maybe now more so than previously, they are looking for good value. They want to feel like they get more than what they pay for, an experience that is worth the money. As long as you manage to meet those expectations, you can build quite a loyal customer base. Chef Goldfarb adds: I think the important thing in Singapore, especially these days, is to be flexible, to adapt and to make sure youre delivering a great product for the greatest number of people as possible. The end of 2025 and start of the new year have seen a flurry of changes in the Singapore restaurant scene. Year-end closures have included Chefs Tavern in Craig Road. The 96-seat restaurant opened in March 2025. Austrian chef Stephan Zoisl, who has started private-dining business Dinner by Chef Stephan, says in the restaurants farewell post on Instagram on Dec 31: After months of trying to hold on amid rising costs and mounting rental pressures, it became impossible for us to continue. What hurts the most is not being able to welcome you during the Christmas period. Knowing that many of you had plans, celebrations and moments you trusted us with, and having to cancel so suddenly, truly broke my heart. Spanish restaurant Sabio at Quayside Isle in Sentosa has also closed after 12 years. According to its Dec 31 farewell post on Instagram, the owners are actively looking for a new home for Sabio. The restaurant has an offshoot in Bangkok. Otherpreviously reported year-end closureshave included one-Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant Esora, Spanish restaurant Sugarra at Resorts World Sentosa and Asu at Labrador Nature Reserve. London pizza chain Pizza Express has closed its Millenia Walk and Scotts Square restaurants. The chain, which has more than 500 restaurants worldwide, still has a presence in Singapore, with outlets at Duo Galleria and The Star Vista. Home-grown coffee chain Kith, which had 10 cafes at its peak, is left with two, ST reported on Jan 7. The two remaining cafes, at Marina Square and New Bahru, are collaborations with edutainment childrens park brand Kiztopia. Despite the slew of closures, new restaurants continue to spring up in Singapore. Statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, which run to November 2025, show that 3,760 food businesses started up in 2025, with 2,861 winding down. The final tally is still to come.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/food/fresh-air-new-management-for-multi-concept-food-venue-air-cccc-in-dempsey

When news broke, it triggered a heated discussion on Chinese cyberspace. Comment sections were flooded with thinly veiled remarks implying that the United States should also do the same to Chinese President Xi Jinping. What a pity it wasnt that person, one netizen wrote. These comments, however, happened to mirror the title of one of Leongs songs, the 2005 release Unfortunately Not You. It is believed that this is the reason the song was taken down from popular Chinese music streaming platform QQ Music. However, Unfortunately Not You is still available on other Chinese music streaming platforms such as Kugou Music and NetEase Cloud Music. The song can also be found on Chinese social media platforms Weibo, Douyin and Xiaohongshu. Internet users in Taiwan were amused by the banning of Unfortunately Not You and joked that a mere song title could spark fear within the government of the Peoples Republic of China. From now on, whenever you see a Chinese social media account, just reply with Fish Leongs song title Unfortunately Not You, one netizen quipped.

What would you assume is the most major threat to the world stage? asked Jack. He went on to claim that Venezuela is arguably the single greatest resource of oil and minerals on the planet. A reel titled Venezuela Explained, featuring a short clip of the scene, broke the internet, accumulating more than 40 million views since it was shared on Instagram by @Saltwater_Survival on Jan 4. The reel has been copied and shared widely across other social media accounts. Netizens have called the scene prophetic amid the recentUS capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro due to his alleged drug-related crimes. The scene was also praised for explaining the current Venezuela situation well. Even Tom Clancys Jack Ryans co-creator Carlton Cuse found it uncanny, telling US film publication Deadline on Jan 4 that the goal of that season wasnt prophecy – it was plausibility. When you ground a story in real geopolitical dynamics, reality has a way of making it rhyme, the 66-year-old American screenwriter said. Cuse explained that the choice of Venezuela as the subject of the second season was conceived more than seven years ago. We were telling a fictional character-driven thriller rooted in Venezuelas longstanding strategic relevance, he said, referencing Graham Roland, his co-creator on the show, adding that their job was to make the situation feel credible. The last episode of Season 2 saw Jack breaking intothe palace of fictionalVenezuelan President Nicolas Reyes (played by Spanish actor Jordi Molla) and holdinghim at gunpoint. While the series showed the corrupt leader losing his power to the opposition,Maduros takedown involved a massive US military operation. The season came from our desire to tell a fictional story about the forces at play, not from imagining an outcome, Cuse added. Tom Clancys Jack Ryan, which ran for four seasons on Prime Video, is based on the lateAmerican authors best-selling novels about the eponymous heroic spy. Clancy wrote 14 titles featuring Jack, the first being The Hunt For Red October in 1984, which was adapted into the 1990 film starring Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-john-krasinskis-jack-ryan-speech-on-venezuela-from-2019-goes-viral-hailed-as-prophetic
Fu Yuan Teochew Dining Greenwood brings Teochew fare with creative flair to Greenwood Avenue,"Jan 08, 2026, 11:30 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 11:30 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/4a32f8a45eea95be6bcd079c514864c49a1970c311a0dc71db91d3cb0c69b522,"(Clockwise, from top left) Chilled Drunken Yellow Roe Crab, Deep-fried Sweet Potato Sesame Ball with Salted Egg Yolk and Wok-fried Preserved Radish Hor Fun at Fu Yuan Teochew Dining Greenwood.ST PHOTO: HEDY KHOO","['Food Picks', 'Food and drink', 'Restaurants/Eateries', 'Singaporean food']","SINGAPORE – Greenwood Avenue has a new addition in the form of Fu Yuan Teochew Dining Greenwood. The 70-seat eatery is the smaller sister outlet of the sprawling 250-seat Fu Yuan Teochew Dining Clarke Quay, which occupies 8,000 sq ft over two levels in Clarke Quay. The Greenwood outlet, opened on Dec 22, 2025, offers live seafood and handmade dim sum, along with familiar signatures from the flagship outlet. The menu stays true to Teochew tradition while introducing just enough creative flair to keep the dishes engaging. Start with the Steamed Pork Dumpling Siew Mai with Tobiko ($9.80++ for four). Handmade daily with fresh chilled pork and prawn, each piece is plump and juicy, with texture coming from crunchy dried shiitake and bursts of tobiko. Deep-fried Sweet Potato Sesame Ball with Salted Egg Yolk ($8.80++ for three) is a modern spin on jin doi. Purple sweet potato is incorporated into the glutinous rice dough for colour, while the centre delivers a molten salted egg yolk core. The balance is spot-on – crisp on the outside, stretchy within and not cloyingly sweet. For something more substantial, the Wok-fried Preserved Radish Hor Fun ($24++ for small, $48++ for large) is a carb dish worth ordering to share. The flat rice noodles are silky and lightly smoky, paired with aged preserved radish sourced from Chaoshan. Even the eggs are deliberately chosen for their deep yellow yolks, lending richness without heaviness. The restaurants showpiece is the Double-boiled Salted Vegetable Pigs Stomach Soup stuffed with French Poulet ($108++), suitable for six to eight diners. A whole French poulet is stuffed into a pigs stomach, then simmered in a pork and chicken stock boiled for up to eight hours, resulting in a gently gelatinous texture. Pumpkin and carrot give the soup its golden hue, while crunchy salted vegetables and Chinese celery add contrast. The peppery warmth from white peppercorns is present but restrained. The pigs stomach and chicken are deboned and portioned tableside before being ladled into individual bowls. Also worth splurging on is the Chilled Drunken Yellow Roe Crab ($88++), which features Sri Lankan crab cooked in a gentle medley of Chinese herbs and served in a house blend of rice wine, lightly sweetened to complement the richness of the yellow roe rather than mask it. End on a comforting note with the Mashed Taro Orh Nee ($7++), which is smooth and fragrant, cooked in shallot oil and pork lard, and paired with pumpkin and ginkgo for a clean, lightly sweet finish.

"If theres any place in the world to do business in 2026, its ASEAN: UOB research head","Jan 08, 2026, 01:39 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 02:25 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1159fe86eed2a089249c6c80c3a97ede9e25d6d964a29155abfabac670fd2bab,Asean will continue to benefit from supply chain shifts and trading with China.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI,"['Asean', 'Trade', 'UOB']","SINGAPORE - ASEAN stands out as an attractive place to do business, supported by a stable operating environment, favourable supply-chain realignments and the opportunities created by theJohor-Singapore Special Economic Zone. This is a place to be, and the supply chain shifts are in favour of us. We are exporting a lot more to the US, selling to the rest of the world and also on our own, we have strong fundamentals – our population, our income growth – to support them, said UOB head of research Suan Teck Kin. Mr Suan, who was speaking at UOBs 2026 market outlook webinar on Jan 7, noted that ASEAN will continue to benefit from supply chain shifts and trading with China. He said: ASEAN will continue to benefit from these supply chain shifts, selling more to the US, selling more domestically. China, as well as the US and Europe, companies are shifting production. You can see that from the foreign direct investment data that these things are still evolving and developing in our favour, and China is doing a lot more with the region. As long as China is holding up, we should be able to benefit from Chinas continued growth. China has been ASEANs largest trading partner for over 16 years, while ASEAN has been Chinas top regional partner for the past five. Bilateral trade surged to nearly $990 billion in 2024, with projections exceeding $1 trillion by the end of 2025. Electrical machinery, mineral fuels and agricultural products are among key exports from ASEAN. Mr Suan noted that it was still business as usual for South-east Asia exports and imports despite threats from US tariffs in 2025. ASEAN also comes out top as an investor destination. ASEAN is top of the league in terms of foreign inflows in investment, he said, adding that investors tend to park money in Singapore because of its financial centre status. UOB estimates that prospects for ASEAN over the next five to 10 years are still positive. UOB senior foreign exchange strategist Peter Chia said that even against the backdrop of a US-China trade war and concerns of a China slowdown, most Asian currencies gained against the US dollar. Half of the battle was won because the US dollar was weak in the first place. But the gross domestic product profile for Asia was remarkable last year, with Singapores 4.8 per cent growth, and even China had met their target of 5 per cent last year. That has caused the Asian currencies to strengthen, he said. For Asian currencies, often they look towards the renminbi for leadership and the trade war was relatively short. So you can see that once the renminbi starts to stabilise, it also adds another dimension, or another source of support for Asian currencies to rally towards the end of the year. UOB Asset Management (UOBAM) on Jan 7 announced it is set to launch an ASEAN Dividend Index exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Jan 29. At the point of listing, it will be the only dividend-focused ASEAN ETF to be listed on the Singapore Exchange. As investors seek to enhance income and strengthen long-term total returns, ASEAN has emerged as an attractive destination for dividend strategies, supported by robust economic fundamentals and a broad base of companies with established dividend track records, the firm said. The region also offers a diverse mix of growth-oriented and established economies, creating opportunities for portfolio diversification across different market cycles, it added. The ETF counts local banks DBS, OCBC and UOB, and other notable names such as Malaysias Malayan Banking, Indonesian conglomerate Astra International and Thailands oil and gas company PTT, among its top constituents. UOBAM said the ETF is aiming to pay annual dividends of at least 6 per cent in 2026 and 2027.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/if-theres-any-place-in-the-world-to-do-business-in-2026-its-asean-uob-research-head
Chinas OpenAI rival Zhipu rises after $715 million IPO,"Jan 08, 2026, 01:15 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:39 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/2f54aeaa7bd16bbc72235b7569a547bf5f0c61784930467586150922cf8f64ad,Zhipu CEO Zhang Peng (left) and chairman Liu Debin at the companys listing ceremony at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Jan 8.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG,"['China', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'IPO']","SHANGHAI-Shares of Knowledge Atlas Technology gained on their Hong Kong debut, following a US$558 million (S$715 million) initial public offering (IPO) that made it the first major Chinese generative artificial intelligence (AI) start-up to go public. The stock rose as much as 16 per cent on Jan 8 to HK$135.00, rebounding after a muted open. The company, better known as Zhipu, offered 37.4 million shares at HK$116.20 apiece to investors last week. Its shares allocated to retail investors were subscribed by more than 1,159 times. Zhipu is the first of Chinas AI tigers – start-ups building large language models to rival OpenAI and Anthropic – to go public. Its listing offers an early test of whether markets view these firms as credible challengers to US counterparts. Despite strong investor interest in AI overall, Chinese software makers face unique operational hurdles, from US export controls that limit access to advanced chips to operating with far less capital and computing power than Silicon Valley developers. Chinese hardware makers have fared well in recent IPOs, supported by localisation demand that brightens the outlook for domestic chip and equipment suppliers. By contrast, Chinese software start-ups, especially in generative AI, encounter greater scepticism as they work to broaden their user base while contending with intense competition from both global rivals and local peers. The Chinese market is hyper-competitive, which naturally drags prices down to these levels, Zhipu co-founder and chairman Liu Debing said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. But as we compete globally, international users will undoubtedly recognise the value. Chinese companies prospects in international competition are underscored by their valuation gap with US peers. Anthropic, the AI start-up behind the chatbot Claude, is raising a new round of funding that would value the company at US$350 billion before the new investment. We have a positive view of this IPO, analyst Douglas Kim wrote in a note on Smartkarma, while assigning Zhipu a valuation of HK$223 per share based on a target price-to-sales multiple of 100 times – a 30 per cent discount to the peer average. Investor interest in the sector – while still robust as China continues to strengthen domestic capabilities – has been accompanied by an ongoing debate around the risk of an AI-related market bubble, said Fidelity International associate investment director Liu Minyue. Zhipus listing comes as Chinese semiconductor firms – a key component in the AI supply chain – are rushing to raise funds. Graphics processing units maker Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor also debuted on Jan 8, rising as much as 33 per cent. Zhipus local rival MiniMax Group is set to list on Jan 9 after a US$619 million IPO. Chip designer Shanghai Biren Technology made a strong debut last week, marking the best first-day performance since 2021 among major Hong Kong listings. Moore Threads Technology and MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai also soared on their listing day in Shanghai in December. Zhipus market capitalisation of US$6.6 billion based on the issue price values the company lower than chipmakers Biren, Moore Threads and MetaX. Zhipu, founded in 2019 by researchers from Chinas Tsinghua University, is celebrated as a pioneer in the nations AI industry. It is backed by Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and several local government funds. That support helped the company win contracts from state-owned enterprises, which prefer building customised AI infrastructure rather than tapping public cloud services. Zhipu mainly serves domestic institutions. The company reported revenue of 312.4 million yuan (S$57.3 million) in 2024. Zhipu plans to use 70 per cent of the IPO proceeds towards research and development of its general-purpose large AI models, according to its prospectus. China AI was the new narrative in 2025 and will likely be even stronger in 2026, Sanford C. Bernsteins analysts, led by Dr Qingyuan Lin, wrote in a note. The market has begun to recognise that Chinas AI development is only months behind global leaders.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/chinas-openai-rival-zhipu-rises-after-715-million-ipo
"Trump considers taking control of Venezuelas PDVSA, lowering oil prices to US$50 a barrel: WSJ","Jan 08, 2026, 11:12 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:48 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1dd315de5190460c5735c3a52fff5463b589534bd2dd8e1a3dfc8f9663ccbfd2,A plan under consideration includes the United States exerting some control over Venezuelas state-run oil company PDVSA.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['Venezuela', 'Oil prices/Crude oil', 'Oil and gas sector', 'Donald Trump']","Bengaluru- US President Donald Trump and his advisers areplanning an initiative to dominate the Venezuelan oil industryfor years to come, and the President told aides he believes his effortscould help lower oil pricesto US$50 a barrel, the Wall Street Journal reported on Jan 7. A plan under consideration includes the US exerting some control over Venezuelas state-run oil company PDVSA, including acquiring and marketing the bulk of the companys oil production, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The White House did not respond immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Oil prices have slid this week on the prospect of higher Venezuelan crude output, though they recovered on Jan 8, with US crude rising 0.7 per cent to US$56.38 a barrel, while Brent crude futures advanced 0.7 per cent to US$60.37. The US is looking to wield control of PDVSA through a deal under which it would work to buy and possibly distribute the companys oil, including through past and current joint ventures with oil majors like Chevron, the report added. PDVSA said earlier on Jan 7 it is progressing in negotiations with the US for oil sales, as a board member told Reuters the US will need to buy cargoes at international prices. Washington and Caracas are in talks to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the US. US officials have said this week that proceeds from the Venezuelan oil supply, which is expected to help PDVSA drain inventories amid a severe oil blockade, will go to a US-overseen trustee. Proceeds are meant to finance supplies of American goods to Venezuela. Mr Trump is also pressing American oil companies to invest in Venezuelas energy sector. The Financial Times reported on Jan 7 that oil majors want serious guarantees from Washington before they make large investments. He is scheduled to meet with the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Jan 9 to discuss ways of raising Venezuelas oil production, and representatives from Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron are expected to be present. Chevron is in talks with the US government to expand a key licence to operate in Venezuela so it can increase crude exports to its own refineries and sell to other buyers, sources said on Jan 7. The company is the only US oil major operating in Venezuela, which it does under an authorisation from the US government that exempts it from sanctions on the country.

China metals in grip of frenzy as investors bet on global rally,"Jan 08, 2026, 09:56 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 10:45 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/3daecc3ee5c83a89f755e35ecd6c2bc8ce9ad2ce60cd8d2fb01e3fdb38cca43c,Heightened geopolitical risk and expectations of a lower interest-rate environment in China and the US are driving investors to pour capital into raw materials.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG,"['China', 'Commodity market', 'Geopolitics']","SHANGHAI-Chinas metal markets are in the grip of a speculative frenzy, with traders and deep-pocketed funds betting on global supply tightness and industrial demand to extend a rally in commodities like copper, nickel and lithium. Open interest has surged to a record across the six base metals traded in Shanghai, indicating robust sentiment. Heightened geopolitical risk and expectations of a lower interest-rate environment in China and the US are also driving investors to pour capital into raw materials. The total turnover of the Shanghai Futures Exchanges six base metals contracts, plus gold and silver futures, reached 37.1 trillion yuan (S$6.8 trillion) in December. The value was up more than 260 per cent from a year earlier; by trading volume, Dec 29 was the single busiest day for copper in more than a decade. Besides general supply tightness, metals are finding support from monetary easing by central banks. Lower interest rates typically encourage investors to buy non-yielding assets like metals. A weaker US dollar is also a tailwind, with investors piling into the so-called debasement trade. Weve seen significant macro allocation flows into commodities, said Shanghai Soochow Jiuying Investment Management head of trading JiaZheng, adding that some equity funds are betting commodity futures will rise alongside stocks in2026. Nickel – used in stainless steel and batteries – rallied nearly 6 per cent on the Shanghai Futures Exchange on Jan 7. The most-active aluminium contract closed at its highest since 2021, while copper has shot beyond a milestone 100,000 yuan a tonne, defying some bearish signs in the local market, including rising inventories. Turnover on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange – including lithium, palladium, platinum and silicon futures – was around 5.6 trillion yuan in December. This was more than six times higher than the same month in 2024, although some of the Guangzhou contracts are relatively new. But questions remain as to whether the scorching rallies have run too far, too fast. As the bull run accelerated in the second half of last year, some of the new capital invested was speculative, said Mr Chi Kai, chief investment officer at Shanghai Cosine Capital Management Partnership. This market will test trading skills, he said. Easy profits wont come simply by holding positions – and the risks are increasing. Volatility is becoming an increasing risk, especially in Guangzhou, where a platinum contract launched at the end of November has already traded either limit-up or limit-down on eight occasions. From mid-December, the Guangzhou bourse also capped new positions and raised fees for lithium carbonate after the contract rallied 35 per cent in the space of around seven weeks. Though open interest has retreated since then, it remains at a historically elevated level. With base metals starting the year strongly – copper hit a record on the London Metal Exchange earlier this week and the LMEX Index that tracks the six main metals surged to the highest level since 2022 – Chinese investors are likely to stick around. This is reinforced by the presence of macro funds, which tend to hold their positions longer, Shanghai Soochows Ms Jia said. Looking ahead to the next six months, under the broad backdrop of monetary easing in China and the US, macro capital is unlikely to exit, she said.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/china-metals-in-grip-of-frenzy-as-investors-bet-on-global-rally

It also announced a minority investment in smart logistics infrastructure company, Ally Logistic Property (ALP), which will lease the facility. CLIs CapitaLand South-east Asia Logistics Fund (CSLF) has acquired a 5.1ha site at 19 Gul Lane in the Jurong Industrial Estate to develop the project – Omega 1 Singapore. The five-storey facility is set to be completed in 2028 and will have a gross floor area of 71,000 sq m. It will also be equipped with robotics, as well as an automated storage and retrieval system capable of handling about 60,000 pallet positions. Ms Patricia Goh, CLIs chief executive of South-east Asia and global head of logistics and self-storage, private funds, said that the move is a strategic response to demand for modern, automated logistics solutions across the region. This demand, she said, has been driven by growth in digitally enabled consumption, an ageing population, rising labour costs and supply chain rationalisation. Concurrent with the development, CLI has acquired a minority stake in ALP, a smart logistics infrastructure firm based in Asia. Upon completion of Omega 1 Singapore, the facility will be fully leased to ALP under a master lease agreement. The deal includes built-in rent escalation, which CLI said will provide CSLF investors with stable and growing income. Over the past two years, CLI has deployed about $500 million into logistics developments across South-east Asia. Following the Gul Lane transaction, the geographical composition of CSLFs portfolio will shift, with Singapore assets now accounting for 55 per cent of its total assets under management. The remainder of the funds portfolio is located in Thailand and Vietnam. The funds other major projects include Thailands Omega 1 Bang Na, a 20ha smart logistics campus in Bangkok, with Phase 1 expected to complete in mid-2026. The fund also has a ready-built factory at Song Khoai Industrial Park in Quang Ninh, Vietnam, which broke ground in September 2025 and is targeting completion by the first half of 2026.

Samsungs profit triples on supercharged AI memory market,"Jan 08, 2026, 08:36 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:56 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f035e1514bca3d9320d969c1f36c2c8fc9ebdab02d3636948f80019ed0b3143a,"Memory makers like Samsung are diverting production to build more lucrative high-end AI chips. That has created a severe shortage in standard memory for laptops and servers, driving up prices.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Samsung', 'Semiconductors', 'AI/artificial intelligence']","SEOUL- Samsung Electronics quarterly profit more than tripled to a record high after global demand for AI servers sharply lifted memory chip prices. South Koreas largest company reported a preliminary operating profit of 20 trillion won (S$17.7 billion) in the three months to December, up 208 per cent and beating the average analyst estimate. Revenue rose 23 per cent to 93 trillion won, also a record. Memory makers like Samsung are diverting production away from everyday tech to build more lucrative high-end chips for AI giants like Nvidia amid a global rush to roll out massive data centres. That has created a severe shortage in standard memory for laptops and servers, causing prices for both DRAM and NAND to surge. Hyperscalers and cloud providers are buying a lot of DRAM and they are willing to pay a price premium, said Mr Sanjeev Rana, head of research at CLSA Securities Korea. Average selling prices of DRAM jumped more than 30 per cent sequentially in the December quarter, while those of NAND rose about 20 per cent, he said, adding that prices are likely to remain very strong throughout 2026 and possibly through the first half of 2027. Even after that, we may not see much correction because demand is just too strong and supply is tight, he said. Samsungs shares have more than doubled in value in 2025 and surged again in January, reflecting hopes for a blowout year after rival Micron Technology gave an upbeat forecast. More than 10 analysts tracked by Bloomberg raised their target price for Samsung in the past week alone. Memory is required in new arenas including humanoids and driverless cars, while devices touting AI capabilities are also contributing to soaring demand for DRAM and NAND, said Mr Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. Its too early to talk about demand peak-out, he said. Investors should buy and hold memory stocks. If the stocks fall after the 20 trillion won earnings figure, its an opportunity to buy. The company will provide a full financial statement with net income and divisional breakdowns on Jan 29. This week, Samsung executives at the CES trade show stressed the scope of the memory chip supply crunch, with president Lee Won-jin sayingconsumer electronics prices are already risingand theres going to be issues around semiconductor supplies. Counterpoint Research forecasts a 40 per cent price rise for DDR5 – the latest generation of conventional DRAM used in computers and servers – in the current quarter compared with the prior three months, followed by an additional 20 per cent growth in the second quarter. Samsung, which has trailed SK Hynix and Micron high-bandwidth memory, delivered its cutting-edge HBM4 samples to Nvidia in 2025 for qualification testing. That has raised hope that Samsung may be able to close the gap with its rivals in a race to begin mass production in the first half of 2026 to support Nvidias upcoming Rubin processors. CLSAs Rana expects Samsungs total HBM shipments to triple in 2026 as HBM4 enters commercial supply.

With that in place, he went to show Singapores banking regulator the safeguards would sufficiently control the risks. Before rolling out the tool that drafts documents for relationship managers at the private wealth arm of OCBC Bank, he took his team of data scientists less than a mile across the citys downtown finance district to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Mr Chiang highlighted the steps the bank would take if things went wrong with their blueprints and how staff would react if the system hallucinated. After the presentation and discussion with representatives at MAS, he left feeling that engineers at the regulator embraced it, said Mr Chiang, 52, the head of financial crime compliance analytics at Bank of Singapore. They were quite happy. Singapores AI efforts underscore a unique balancing act: The Government is working hand in glove with the countrys largest banks to teach new technology skills. The unspoken intent is to limit the large-scale job losses seen at some financial firms in the US and Europe. At stake is the future of thousands of bank workers at a time when giants of the industry, such as Goldman Sachs have told staff to expect more job cuts as they take advantage of AI. Singapores Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat, who is also deputy chairman of the MAS, has said the three large banks DBS Bank, OCBC and UOB are retraining all 35,000 of their domestic staff over the next one to two years. The government is doing something about it because they realise that this capability and this change is actually infusing potentially a lot of fear, said Ms Violet Chung, a senior partner at McKinsey & Co. Given what weve seen in other markets like the US where were seeing much more aggressive job cuts and reductions, the government is essentially aware that we need to do something as a country to do something for these leading companies. For David, 39, who manages money for a banks wealthy clients, smarter technology is helping him work faster than at any time in his 16-year career, but thats raising the expectations of his bosses and has left him feeling unsettled. He would typically spend around an hour preparing a single customer order form – now, it takes him 10 to 12 minutes. That means more time in front of clients, he said.He declined to give his full name discussing private details about his work. Banks will be able to increase the number of customers that each of their relationship managers can cover, say from 50 up to 60 or 70, according to Mr Mohan Jayaraman, senior partner at Bain & Co. The argument is that if you are able to spend more time with customers, you get better coverage, he said.

Singapores National Jobs Council, which sprang out of the countrys employment needs during the Covid-19 pandemic, now also works with the not-for-profit Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) as a key partner to foster job growth for the finance industry. In some cases, as roles change, the institute works with and pays for finance firms to map out how staff can take on redesigned roles or pivot to new career paths. In one scenario, it offers banks up to 90 per cent salary support to reskill mid-career staff or new hires, according to its website. MAS says it works closely with the IBF, financial institutions and unions to prepare the sectors workforce for AI adoption. OCBC and UOB have said they arent making AI-related job cuts. DBS has said it will not lay off permanent staff, but expects to reduce about 4,000 temporary and contract roles over the next three years as vendor contracts end. A Bloomberg Intelligence analysis forecasts DBS will make bigger AI-derived cost savings than its peers and help boost pretax profit by up to $1.6 billion, or about 17 per cent, in the next few years. Staff at DBS now use an internal AI assistant that handles more than one million prompts a month. It has also built role-specific tools, including one for customer service officers that has reduced call handling time by up to 20 per cent. UOB has given all its employees access to Microsoft Copilot and deployed more than 300 AI use cases across the bank. Watching from the inside, Ms Vania Lim, 22, spent last summer as an AI intern in the global payments team at HSBC Holdings. She is optimistic about new roles emerging in digital assets and improving use cases for wallets, but worries that some of the skills for junior hires are not all that unique any more. Everyone is so well versed with AI nowadays, she says. Its no longer so much of a competitive advantage. Older staff like Woon Leng, in her 60s, says the training to keep up with new technology feels like one more thing piled on top of an already demanding job of managing a branch. She has worked at a local bank for more than 40 years and now uses ChatGPT at her branch to help answer customer questions about products. Staff also have to take online courses on AI after work as it is too busy during the day and try to pass a test afterwards, she added.She declined to give her full name discussing her employer. Many banks are choosing not to fill roles when staff move on either within the firm or outside it, said Walter Theseira, associate professor of economics at Singapore University of Social Sciences. Of course, companies dont like to do layoffs and redundancies, especially if they are major firms that the Singapore economy and government watches very closely, he said. But firms can pursue a headcount reduction simply by not filling roles when you have natural attrition. At OCBC, there were fewer than a handful of people in the AI lab when Mr Kenneth Zhu joined in 2018. Eight years later, the 36-year-old executive director of data science and AI oversees a lab that sits within a data office of more than 100 staff. Some 400 models make six million decisions every day, from flagging suspicious transactions to scoring credit risk and filtering out false positives in anti-money laundering systems that once chewed up compliance officers time. While it is too early to assess if the Singapore approach will pay off for banks and their staff, Dr Jochen Wirtz, vice-dean of MBA programmes and professor of marketing at National University of Singapore, said the technologys potential remains huge and cautions against firms holding back. My hunch is that we havent really scratched the surface yet, he said. Banks would be completely stupid now to load up on employees who they will then have to let go again in three or four years. Youre much better off freezing now, trying to retrain whatever you can. At UOB, the bank is busy building AI fluency across the organisation as well as training staff, such as via an internal Better U Pivot programme. Inaction is not really an option for us or anybody, said Mr Alvin Eng, its head of enterprise AI. Its a slow path to irrelevance.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/inside-singapores-ai-bootcamp-to-retrain-35000-bankers
"Buyer caught in 99-1 property deal drops lawsuit against agent, ERA and law firm","Jan 08, 2026, 07:45 AM","Jan 08, 2026, 09:19 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/8c87a488716caeb00d7096dd812cefc672206a74e8afa30e7daa2e000e296531,The buyer claimed that the property agent had proposed the 99-to-1 structure during his purchase of a condominium unit at Normanton Park.PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO FILE,"['Singapore companies', 'Civil lawsuits', 'Singapore property', 'The Business Times']","SINGAPORE - A home buyer rapped by the taxman for attempting to evade stamp duty has withdrawn his lawsuit against property agency ERA Realty, its salesperson and a law firm over alleged misrepresentation and negligence linked to a so-called 99-1 property transaction. The buyer, Mr Lim Yuan Zhang, had filed a suit against the three in the State Courts of Singapore over a 99-to-1 transaction in May 2025, seeking $180,945 in damages – the amount in additional tax and surcharge that the taxman had asked him to pay for having avoided paying the relevant stamp duty for his purchase of a condominium unit. Mr Lim claimed that the property agent, Mr Jeremy Chan, had proposed the 99-to-1 structure during the purchase of a new-launch unit at the 99-year leasehold condominium, Normanton Park. This arrangement would allow Mr Lims father to buy 1 per cent of the property and take on a joint loan to fund the purchase of the unit, while reducing the total amount of additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) payable for owning a second property. Mr Lim said Mr Chan had misrepresented the legality of 99-to-1 transactions as a commonly used and foolproof method of reducing the ABSD payable when purchasing a property. Mr Lim also argued that the conveyancing law firm, Anthony Law Corporation (ALC), failed to properly advise or warn him about the legal risks of the 99-to-1 arrangement, and proceeded with the transactions conveyance despite the risks. He claimed that ALC was professionally negligent and in breach of both contract and fiduciary duty. Had he been properly advised, he said he would not have gone ahead with the arrangement. ALC was one of three firms penalised by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) in August 2025 foranti-money laundering breachesin the purchase of properties linked to Singapores $3 billion money laundering case. The firm was ordered to pay a financial penalty of $100,000. The head of its conveyancing department, Mr Tan Chau Chuang, was also referred to the Law Society. In his lawsuit, first filed in May 2025, Mr Lim alleged that the agent, Mr Chan, had supposedly obtained legal clearance in endorsing the 99-to-1 transaction, and would guide and oversee its execution. Persuaded by Mr Chans representations, Mr Lim paid $49,250 for an option to purchase the $985,000 unit on Nov 18, 2021. Mr Lims father purchased a 1 per cent interest in the property on Jan 26, 2022, completing the 99-to-1 transaction. In December 2024, Iras ordered Mr Lim and his father to pay $246,744 – $164,496 as ABSD and a surcharge of $82,248. The surcharge was later lowered to $16,449 after Mr Lims appeal to Iras, bringing the total sum to $180,945. In the lawsuit, Mr Lim suggested that the representations were fraudulent, with Mr Chan either knowing they were false or being reckless with the truth so he could profit from the property purchase by earning a commission from either the developer or the law firm. Further to this, Mr Lim claimed that the property agency was responsible for training Mr Chan as a real estate agent, including being adequately knowledgeable about the relevant laws and regulations. He added that ERA failed to supervise its salesperson, and stood to benefit substantially from the transaction through commissions and business activity. In their defence, Mr Chan and ERA denied giving legal and tax advice for the property purchase. The two said they were the appointed real estate agents of the propertys developer, not Mr Lim. Even if Mr Chan owed Lim a duty of care, which he denied, this was not breached as Mr Chan was not qualified or expected to advise on the legality of ABSD arrangements. Instead, he argued that the duty of care lay with ALC, Lims appointed solicitor. Mr Chan added that any statements made were based on materials provided during the law firms training sessions, including how the 99-to-1 structure could help minimise buyers ABSD payments. Likewise, ERA claimed that it was not hired to perform any estate agency work for Mr Lim, whether in the property purchase or 99-to-1 arrangement, nor did it receive any commission fee from him. In any case, ERA pointed out that any loss and damage was suffered by Mr Lims father and not himself. Even if it was found to have breached the duty of care, any recoverable loss should be limited to the penalty of $16,449, not the full amount of $180,945. It also described Mr Chan as an independent contractor, not an employee, and said it should not be vicariously liable for his actions. Nonetheless, the agency claimed to have proper systems, training and supervision in place for its salespeople, who were required to comply with professional codes and not engage in illegal arrangements. Meanwhile, ALC argued that it was asked to handle only conveyancing services for the 99-to-1 structure, not to give an opinion on its legality. The firm also alleged that it did not know Mr Lims identity or plans for the 99-to-1 transaction when preliminary enquiries were made by the agent, nor did the firm endorse it. During their first and only in-person meeting, the firm said that it had, as part of its standard practice, drawn Mr Lims attention to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapores broad powers under the Stamp Duties Act, including its authority to disregard such transactions and impose surcharges. It further argued that it was hired only to provide conveyancing services for the transfer of the 1 per cent share of property from Lim to his father, and that Mr Lim was separately represented by another law firm, Acclaim Law. At no point in time did (Lim) seek (the firms) advice on the legality of the structure… (nor) in any event, endorse the said structure, it said. Court records showed that Mr Lim discontinued the action against ERA, Mr Chan and ALC in November, and each party bore its own costs. The case is the latest in a string of lawsuits entangling property agents over purported sale arrangements for buyers to avoid paying more in ABSD. Most recently in November, a couple sued a PropNex subsidiary, along with its salesperson and ALC, for an alleged breach of duty over another 99-to-1 property transaction. That was PropNexs third reported lawsuit involving 99-to-1 transactions. The first reported case, in which the agency was sued for about $1.2 million in January 2025, was withdrawn on Jan 2, 2026. A second lawsuit filed against it in February 2025 was withdrawn in October, PropNex disclosed in a bourse filing then. ALC is one of three law firms singled out by MinLaw to be penalised for their involvement in the conveyancing of real estate properties seized in 2023s $3 billion anti-money laundering bust. In a statement in August, MinLaw said ALC had acted for nine clients to convey 25 properties valued at around $135 million in total. Among other breaches, MinLaw said then that the firm did not corroborate or verify the clients explanations for why the transactions were being funded by seemingly unrelated third parties, even though these were red flags. ALC also continued to undertake transactions for some of these clients despite filing Suspicious Transaction Reports against them.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/buyer-caught-in-99-1-property-deal-drops-lawsuit-against-agent-era-and-law-firm

Drops in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average followed intraday record highs earlier in the session. Shares of housing acquisition companies tumbled after US President Donald Trump said he was moving to ban Wall Street investors from buying single-family homes, in a bid to reduce home prices. Blackstone and Apollo Global Management dropped more than 5 per cent, contributing to a 1.4 per cent decline in the S&P 500 financials index. American Homes 4 Rent fell 4.3 per cent. Real estate platform Zillow moved more than 2 per cent higher. JPMorgan Chase fell 2.3 per cent after Wolfe Research downgraded the bank to peer perform from outperform. Northrop Grumman slid 5.5 per cent and Lockheed Martin lost 4.8 per cent after Mr Trump said he would not permit dividends or stock buybacks for defence companies until they fixed problems with the production of military equipment. In his social media post, Mr Trump did not mention specific companies. Nvidia and Microsoft rose about 1 per cent each, and Alphabet rose more than 2 per cent as investors shifted back into AI stocks following recent worries they were overvalued. Underscoring investor appetite for heavyweight AI players, Anthropic is planning a multibillion-dollar fundraise that would value the Claude chatbot maker at US$350 billion (S$448 billion). That would make the privately held company more valuable than the vast majority of corporations, including Advanced Micro Devices, Chevron and Wells Fargo. Investors have come into 2026 with a similar playbook to last year: Buy tech and forget about it. Rumours that the AI trade was done turned out not to be true, said Mr Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Heading into fourth-quarter earnings season in the next few weeks, valuations on Wall Street remain relatively pricey. The S&P 500 is trading at about 22 times expected earnings, down from 23 in November, but above the indexs five-year average of 19, according to LSEG data. The S&P 500 declined 0.34 per cent to end the session at 6,920.93 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.16 per cent to 23,584.28 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.94 per cent to 48,996.08 points. Data on Jan 7 showed US job openings fell more than expected in November after rising marginally in October, while a separate ADP report showed that private payrolls increased less than expected in December. While the latest labour market datasets mark a return to the standard release of economic data disrupted by the US government shutdown, they did little to change expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve ahead of a key government payrolls report on Jan 9. Investors were also monitoring geopolitical developments after the US said it seized a Russian-flagged, Venezuela-linked tanker as part of Mr Trumps aggressive push to dictate oil flows in the Americas and force Caracas socialist government to become its ally. The White House said on Jan 6 that Mr Trump was discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the US military. Memory and storage technology companies gave up some of their steep gains following a recent rally. Western Digital dropped almost 9 per cent and Seagate Technology fell 6.7 per cent. First Solar tumbled 10 per cent after Jefferies downgraded the solar panel makers rating to hold from buy. Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 by a 3.4-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 28 new highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 106 new highs and 58 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was relatively heavy, with 17.4 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 16.2 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/sp-500-ends-lower-ai-stocks-buoy-nasdaq

Minnesota Timberwolves savour scintillating stretch as the hot Cleveland Cavaliers visit,"Jan 08, 2026, 03:27 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 03:27 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/256802e8ca06281155e83f2a49cf3eb80348bd09289a7259e50fa78139a31e57,"Anthony Edwards and the Minnesota Timberwolves will be chasing their fourth NBA win in a row when they tip off against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Jan 8 (Jan 9, Singapore time) in Minneapolis.PHOTO: IMAGN IMAGES","['NBA', 'Cleveland Cavaliers', 'Basketball players', 'Player transfers', 'New York Knicks']","MINNEAPOLIS – After one of their worst losses of the National Basketball Association (NBA) season, the Minnesota Timberwolves have put together one of their best stretches. Minnesota will go for their fourth win in a row when they tip off against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Jan 8 (Jan 9, Singapore time) in Minneapolis. It is the start of a home-and-home series between the teams, who will travel to Cleveland for a rematch on Jan 10. The Timberwolves are coming off a 28-point win over the Miami Heat on Jan 6. It was the third straight victory since Minnesota were outhustled in a 24-point loss against the Atlanta Hawks on Dec 31. Timberwolves top scorer Anthony Edwards walked off the court and to the locker room after coach Chris Finch benched his starters during the blowout loss in Atlanta. That moment, combined with the teams lackadaisical effort, prompted questions about the teams true identity. The last three games offer evidence that the Timberwolves still have plenty to offer as they look to climb the Western Conference standings. The game in Atlanta was just a wake-up call for all of us, Timberwolves centre Rudy Gobert said. It put it on ourselves to say, Do we really want to be that team? Or do we want to be the team that we said were going to be, which is a championship team? I think the answer is pretty obvious. Minnesota will face a Cavaliers squad that are coming off a 120-116 win on the road against the Indiana Pacers. It was the fourth win in the past five games for Cleveland. Darius Garland will try to stay hot after scoring 29 points on 14-for-23 shooting in Clevelands most recent win. Garland is averaging 17.5 points and 6.9 assists in 22 games. Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson praised Garland for his recent efforts. Garland missed the start of the season due to injury and is looking to return to the form that he showed last season, when he earned his second career All-Star selection. That was like Takeover DG from last year, Atkinson said of Garlands most recent performance. He really hit some big, big shots – some tough shots. Sam Merrill also could play a decisive role for Cleveland. He made six of 10 attempts from beyond the arc in the Cavaliers most recent game. There was one point I said, Just get Sam the ball, Atkinson said. Run off-ball (offence) or pick-and-roll with him... We needed that extra push from someone creativity-wise, and Sam gave it to us. Edwards leads the Timberwolves with 29.3 points per game on 50.4 per cent shooting from the field. Julius Randle is averaging 22.1 points, and Jaden McDaniels ranks third with 14.5 points. McDaniels is coming off a 19-point performance in the win over Miami. Coming out of the holiday period, the priority was to get Jaden back into the mix offensively, whether it be play calls or just kind of finding him in the flow a little bit more, Finch said. Hes really responding. Meanwhile, in news off the court, the Atlanta Hawks are trading four-time All-Star point guard Trae Young to the Washington Wizards, multiple outlets reported Wednesday night. The return package from Washington reportedly includes veteran guard C.J. McCollum and forward Corey Kispert. Young, 27, has spent his entire career in Atlanta since he was acquired via from Dallas immediately after the Mavericks selected with the fifth overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. He led the Hawks to the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2020-21 season, but they followed with first-round exits the following two seasons and have been eliminated in the play-in the last two seasons. Young, the franchises all-time leader in assists (4,837) and three-pointers made (1,295), has averaged 25.2 points, 9.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and one steal per contest over 493 games (all starts) with the Hawks. However, he has played just 10 of the teams 39 games this season, missing an extended stretch with a sprained medial collateral ligament and sitting out currently due to a right quad contusion. ESPN said Young had been keen to join the Wizards, where he will be reunited with Washington executive Travis Schlenk, who drafted him in 2018. Washington, who are one place off the bottom of the Eastern Conference with a 10-26 record, view Young as the centerpiece of their rebuilding project. In on-court action on Jan 7, the New York Knicks ended their four-game losing streak with a 123-111 win over the struggling Los Angeles Clippers. Jalen Brunson scored 26 points while Karl-Anthony Towns added 20 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. For the most part, we played a little desperate tonight, Brunson said. We needed a win. The way we competed, the way we played, even if we were down in the first half, was Knicks basketball.We just kept playing that way and found a way to win. In Oklahoma City, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander rescued the Thunder with a game-tying buzzer-beater before finishing with 46 points in a 129-125 overtime victory against the Utah Jazz. Its not always going to be pretty, but weve got to play a lot better... wed rather learn lessons in a win than in a loss, he said after helping the NBA champions avoid a third straight loss.

Starc, who took 31 wickets, was the only one of the quartet of bowlers that have kept Australia at the top of the game for a decade to play all five tests. Regular captain Pat Cummins played just one as he battled a back problem, spinner Nathan Lyon managed two before being sidelined by a hamstring problem and Josh Hazlewood was ruled out before the series started. Added to that, Australia needed an emergency opener in the series opener in Perth when Usman Khawaja suffered back spasms and was unable to bat in the second innings. Travis Head took up the role and kept it for the remainder of the series, notching three such influential centuries that he was unlucky to miss out to Starc for Player of the Series honours. After stand-in skipper Steve Smith had paid tribute to Starcs incredible performances in the post-match press conference, the 35-year-old returned the compliment. Okay, Pat wasnt there, but we have someone whos captained the team so much in the past, has a great cricket brain. It was business as usual, Starc said. I think Steves captained phenomenally well through the series, was ahead of the game, ahead of England for a lot of it. And then, whether it be the different batters, different Trav opening, different bowling setups, we knew as a group that we had the guys that could fill different roles and be adaptable in different situations. LITTLE MOMENTS Starc said that was not a recent development and that the team had been fully confident the likes of fast bowlers Scott Boland and Michael Neser would come in and play their part. I think its been a feature as well over the years, said the left-arm paceman. Its not just about having a settled 11. Its very much a squad mentality. Whether its Scotty playing five (tests) and doing his role so well, Neser coming in and having his first crack at red-ball cricket and probably having his best series for Australia of his career. Theyre those little moments as a squad that I think have got us across the line to four wins this series. Both Starc and Smith, who is 36, said they were not looking too far ahead but would not rule out still being around to tour India as well as England in 2027. I think this group has shown that, whilst theres so much made about our age profile, I think at times through this series, that experience has been a really good thing in some moments in this series, said Starc. And I think weve seen guys prove that if youre still playing your role, or if youre still good enough, it shouldnt matter how old you are. If we both get to go on those tours in 27 itd be lovely to tick them off, but weve got plenty of cricket before then.

England lost the fifth and final test of a deeply disappointing series at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday and the loss will do little to dampen the criticism of the way the team approached the campaign. In particular, critics have pointed the finger at the high-risk Bazball approach to the game along with questions about the levels of preparation for the tour, which saw England quickly fall to an insurmountable 3-0 deficit. The 34-year-old all-rounder, though, said he wanted to remain skipper for the upcoming home test series against New Zealand and Pakistan. (Im) definitely, keen as anything to carry on, he told reporters. I love having a challenge thrown at me and at the moment the challenge is getting the team back to where we once were in terms of the performances that we were delivering. Asked about McCullums position, Stokes gave his full backing to the New Zealander, who has a contract until after the 2027 home series against the Australians and said he expected him to remain in his role. I do expect him to be (in charge) but again its not my decision, he said. Im sure if it ever ... comes to it, Ill be asked my opinion and hell be getting my full support and backing. I absolutely love working with Baz. Hes a great man and hes a very, very good coach. You know theres more that goes on behind the scenes than hell ever give away and than hell ever let out. Critics, such as former England captain Michael Vaughan, have said that McCullum will need to accept that his approach has failed and agree to a different style for the team. When asked about being given such instruction from his bosses at the ECB, the coach was far from welcoming of the idea. I am not against assistance but have a firm belief in how to get the best out of these players, McCullum told the BBC. I will look at it individually and say, what could I have done better? Am I for being told what to do? Of course I am not. But at the same time Im not thinking there wont be areas to improve. Stokes appeared sympathetic to McCullums stance. Me and Brendon, we know how to run a dressing room, we know how to try and give the lads the best possible chance of being as good as they can be, he added. Everyones got an opinion how things should be run and kind of stuff like that. So it is always tough. But I would never try to tell someone who runs a huge business what they should do because I havent got any expertise in that whatsoever. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD While quick to back his coach, Stokes was frank in his assessment of Englands recent form, which includes a drawn series at home to India, suggesting opponents might have worked out Bazball. I think that we are now playing against teams who have answers to the style of cricket that we have been playing over quite a long period of time now, he said. I think in the first couple of years, teams found it difficult to try and come up with anything to come to combat the way that we played but now teams are I think coming up with plans that (are) standing up to a certain style of cricket that we want to play. When you come up against a team like Australia out here, who know how to play cricket out here and you are adding to your own downfall then youre going to end up losing the series 4-1 like we have done. Stokes accepted that England need to rethink their approach in order to win the big series.

Seamer Josh Tongue led Englands battling rearguard with 3-42 but Alex Carey got Australia across the line with a four through the covers in mid-afternoon in the company of Cameron Green. Weve played so well as a team, said Steve Smith, who was standing in for Pat Cummins as Australia captain for the fourth time in the series. Weve had some incredible individual performances but ... everyone else just stood up at different moments. I think thats what makes a really good team. We won those big moments throughout the series. England will take credit for making a game of it and not being ground into the Sydney dirt as previous tourists have in end-of-series dead rubbers at the famous old ground. Without the bowling of injured captain Ben Stokes, however, defending 160 was always going to be an uphill challenge on a good wicket which allowed day-five action for the second time in the series. Australias openers managed to get the target under 100 runs before Man of the Match Travis Head, whose third century of the series underpinned his teams first-innings 567, ballooned a shot to midwicket off Tongue for 29. Jake Weatherald followed for 34, again caught off Tongues bowling, to bring up lunch with Australia 89 runs from their goal. It was 15 years and a day since England won the final test of the 2010-11 series at the same ground by an innings and 83 runs -- the last time they won an Ashes series Down Under. Khawaja made his debut in that match and got his chance for one final innings before retirement when Smith was bowled through the gate by the spin of Will Jacks for 12 soon after lunch. The England players formed a cordon to welcome Khawaja to the crease but Tongues bowling was less friendly and the lefthander played on for six after facing seven balls. I was trying to act cool, but the whole test match I found it really hard to control my emotions, the 39-year-old admitted. Labuschagne had been dropped on 20 off Tongue when Bethell failed to hold onto the ball despite an acrobatic leap at backward point. He was unable to make the most of his reprieve, however, running himself out for 37 with 39 runs still required for victory. Carey, who made 16 not out, and Green, who finished unbeaten on 22, nearly reprised Labuschagnes exit with a classic mix-up after an overthrow but eventually made their ground to secure the victory. Its a tough one to take knowing that we can play better than that, said Stokes, who exhorted his players from the slips on Thursday. But Ive got to give full credit to (Australia), theyve been just incredible for five test matches. STARC STRIKES AGAIN TO HURT ENGLAND England had resumed on 302-8 but Mitchell Starc struck a major blow to their hopes of setting Australia a testing target when he had Bethell caught behind for 154. Bethells superb maiden test century offered plenty of promise for the future and was essentially the difference between an innings defeat for England and Australia batting again. Starc (3-72) returned to remove Tongue for six to end the innings on 342, the left-arm quick later awarded Player of the Series honours for his tally of 31 wickets over the five tests. The body is still holding together and this is a great group to be a part of, the 35-year-old said. I am a little tired but got the job done. In Sydney, Australia were again that bit superior in every department, as they were when wins in Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide secured possession of the Ashes urn for another 18 months in just 11 days. England won a lottery of a fourth test in Melbourne -- their first win in Australia since Sydney in 2011 -- but the future of the Bazball style of play must be in doubt after a tour that started with high hopes ended in a 4-1 loss. Weve not won the big series that we want to be winning, said Stokes. When a trend is happening on a consistent basis ... thats when you do need to go back and look at the drawing board and make some adjustments. Despite Englands woes, the Ashes remain as popular as ever with the 211,032 fans through the gates over the five days in Sydney, the most ever for a test match at the ground.

Sabalenka to skip events in 2026 to prioritise her health,"Jan 08, 2026, 01:41 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 01:41 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/402300f295177bbce7d54a816da51b67ba883e81b0615558a3118545136da6ac,"Tennis - Battle of the Sexes - Nick Kyrgios v Aryna Sabalenka - Coca-Cola Arena, Dubai, United Arab Emirates - December 28, 2025 Belarus Aryna Sabalenka reacts during her match against Australias Nick Kyrgios Christopher Pike/Pool via REUTERS","['Aryna Sabalenka', 'Grand Slam']","Jan 8 - Aryna Sabalenka expects to skip events again this year rather than put her health at risk over the course of an insane season, even though she knows she is likely to be sanctioned by the WTA Tour for doing so, the world number one said. Top players are obliged to compete in all four Grand Slams, 10 WTA 1000 tournaments and six WTA 500 events under WTA rules, with the punishment for missing them ranging from rankings points deductions to fines. In 2025, Sabalenka competed in just three WTA 500 events - Brisbane, Stuttgart and Berlin - making her one of a number of high-ranked players, including world number two Iga Swiatek, to be docked ranking points. Asked if she would change her plans for 2026, the four-times Grand Slam champion told reporters: The season is definitely insane, and thats not good for all of us, as you see so many players getting injured ... The rules are quite tricky with mandatory events, but Im still skipping a couple events in order to protect my body, because I struggled a lot last season, the Belarusian said after beating Sorana Cirstea at the Brisbane International. Even though the results were really consistent, some of the tournaments I had been playing completely sick or Ive been really exhausted from overplaying. This season we will try to manage it a little bit better, even though they are going to fine me by the end of the season. But its tricky to do that. You cannot skip 1000 events. Its really tricky, and I think thats insane what they do. I think they just follow their interests, but theyre not focusing on protecting all of us. The mens and womens circuits have faced criticism due to their 11-month seasons, and both tours came under fresh scrutiny during the Asian swing towards the end of last year with injuries piling up. In September, the WTA told Reuters that athlete welfare is a top priority and that it had listened to views on the calendar, both through the players council and their representatives on the WTA board, to improve the circuit structure in 2024 and boost compensation.

Rosenior, who replaced Italian Enzo Maresca, joined Chelsea on Tuesday from Racing Strasbourg and will take charge of his first game on Saturday when the London club travel to Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup. He was in the stands on Wednesday as Chelsea were beaten 2-1 by Fulham, a defeat which left them eighth with one win from their last nine league games. For this opportunity to come up at this stage of my career is great but my biggest focus is not about being Chelsea manager, its about being a winning Chelsea manager, Rosenior told Sky Sports ahead of Wednesdays defeat. That is the message I gave the players yesterday when I was fortunate enough to meet them for the first time. We need to hit the ground running for the rest of the season. Chelsea have a hectic run of fixtures in January and early February with 10 games in 31 days. Asked if it would be difficult to impose his style with matches coming thick and fast, Rosenior said: No, I think Enzo, the previous manager, has done a really, really good job with the team tactically. My game is not dissimilar. There are different characteristics in terms of the way that I play that I want to put my stamp on. People talk about tactics and systems and philosophies, (but) I want to see good energy in a team. I want to see a team thats hard to beat. I want to see a team that runs for each other and fights.

Australias James eyes elusive halfpipe gold at Milano Cortina,"Jan 08, 2026, 12:26 PM","Jan 08, 2026, 12:26 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7d04d36cd853cef6f6518d9257a185d8b2246b5fe8a8261b5b59e582a921ec39,"FILE PHOTO: Snowboarding - FIS Freestyle World Championships - Mens Halfpipe - St Moritz, Switzerland - March 29, 2025 Australias Scotty James during the Mens Halfpipe training REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo","['Australia', 'Olympics', 'World championships']","MELBOURNE, Jan 8 - Snowboarder Scotty James will head to the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics as one of Australias biggest medal chances after more than a decade of pushing the limits in halfpipe. Australias flag-bearer at Pyeongchang 2018 took bronze at the Games in South Korea, silver at Beijing four years ago and is desperate to go one better in the Italian Alps where he will drop in at his fifth Olympics. The elephant in the room for me is I havent won a gold medal yet, the 31-year-old said in the Netflix documentary, Scotty James: Pipe Dream released in December. That could be about to change. He won his fourth world title at St Moritz-Engadin, Switzerland, in March and currently sits second on the World Snowboard Points List, the global ranking system for the previous 52 weeks. Only Japans Ruka Hirano, runner-up at the world championships, sits above him. Gold would make James Australias most decorated Winter Olympian, eclipsing freestyle skier Dale Begg-Smith and womens snowboarder Torah Bright, who each took a gold and silver in their events. Having made his Olympic debut at 2010 Vancouver and been at the peak of halfpipe for over a decade, James faced some doubts through the last Olympic cycle about whether he still had the motivation. However, becoming a father a year ago proved a new spur to keep pushing for the sports biggest prizes. Thats been a really awesome motivator for me to now want to win, but do it with a family at my side, he told Australian media. If I tried to continue to want to be the best from the day I started 10 years ago, Id just run myself into the ground because I dont operate the same. So Ive always been open-minded about how I can evolve to keep that level of intensity. Rivals-wise, Jamess title threats are familiar and Japanese-heavy. Olympic champion Ayumu Hirano remains the benchmark when he is on, while Ruka Hirano and Yuto Totsuka have been trading podiums with the Australian at the biggest events. Led by Ayumu Hirano, the three Japanese athletes swept the podium at the season-opener in Secret Garden, China, the first World Cup of the season. James is banking on his experience and creativity in stitching together new trick combinations to stick the landing on top of the podium. For me, getting better is putting myself in uncomfortable environments and challenging myself, whether thats with tricks, competitors, or different halfpipes, he said.

Hamed held multiple featherweight world titles in a career lasting from 1992 to 2002 and was famed for his spectacular entrances and ringside antics. Giant follows Hameds rise from humble beginnings, focusing on his relationship with mentor and trainer Brendan Ingle. Irishman Ingle, played by Brosnan, runs a gym in the English city of Sheffield, seeking to inspire youngsters to swap life in the streets for the ring. When Hameds Yemeni parents send their sons there to better equip them against racist bullies, 7-year-old Naseem stands out with his fast footwork and swagger. Ingles unorthodox training methods and Hameds talent propel the two to the top of the sport, but success tests their bond. Its a story of two men who are wildly ambitious ... who know what its like to be on the outside of life and have this ferocious passion to be great, said Brosnan premiering the film in London on Wednesday. Brothers Ghaith and Ali Saleh play Hamed at ages 7 and 12, while El-Masry portrays the boxer at his peak. El-Masry spent four weeks preparing for the role, training 12 hours a day, losing 8 kg (18 pounds) and watching archive footage to hone in on Hameds movements and bravado. Massive boots to fill. He was one of my heroes growing up, said El-Masry. Sylvester Stallone was an executive producer for Giant, which was written and directed by Rowan Athale. Athale described the movie as a fractured love story between a father and a son. The late Ingles contributions to boxing and his community needed to be focused on, Athale said. Hes as brilliant in his field as Naz was in his, so I wanted to give them equal time. Hamed, 51, who showed his support by attending the London premiere, was not involved in the production. To be really honest, this is not a story about me. Its a film about the prince and his trainer. Its not really had my input at all, so its some good parts and theres some bad parts, Hamed said, adding he was planning a documentary series about his life with actor Mark Wahlberg.

After two second places in the four previous slaloms, Noel got it together under the floodlights in the Italian resort of Madonna di Campiglio to beat Finlands first-run leader Eduard Hallberg by 0.12 seconds over the two legs. Hallberg had looked to be on course for his first win until he made a small but costly mistake six gates from the finish.

Noel is now three points behind Norways Timon Haugan, who tied for sixth place with Belgiums Armand Marchant, in the slalom standings with Rassat third after skiing the fastest second leg to secure his second career podium. There have now been five different slalom winners in five races this season. It was a tough race, it was really tight, said Noel, who was third after the first run. I was not really happy with my first run but I was in contention. I knew it was going to need a lot of commitment in the second. The win was the 15th of his career in the World Cup.
