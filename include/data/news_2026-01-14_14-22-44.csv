Grouping HDB blocks with fewer units together for HIP voting under consideration: Chee Hong Tat,"Jan 14, 2026, 09:45 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:45 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/332284b4fd4dc05ca4b278874cb29449437a408e497ae9bfbf1fa206ca810a03,The programme can start when at least 75 per cent of a blocks eligible Singaporean households have voted for it.ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI,"['Singapore Parliament', 'HDB', 'Public housing', 'Housing policy', 'Ministry of National Development']","SINGAPORE – The authorities are studying grouping HDB blocks with fewer units together to vote for the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) as a cluster, so that enough households participate in the voting process. In a written parliamentary reply on Jan 14, National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat said this is one option the authorities are considering to address the challenges faced by blocks with fewer units. We understand that under the current voting process, blocks with fewer eligible units may face greater risks of not reaching 75 per cent of votes to proceed with HIP, he said. This comes aftertwo HDB blocks in Tiong Bahru narrowly missed the voting thresholdin November 2025, which disappointed some residents who hoped for improvements to their ageing flats. Mr Chee said the authorities arereviewing the voting process for such blocks, in order to strike a balance between upgrading older flats and respecting the decisions of flat owners. He was responding to Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast-Jurong West GRC), who asked how many HDB blocks had failed to garner enough votes for HIP in the last 10 years, how many were allowed a re-poll, and what was the outcome of each re-poll. Six HDB blocks were unable to garner the 75 per cent of votes needed to undergo HIP over the last 10 years, Mr Chee said. These were:one block at Serangoon Ave 2 in 2017 and three blocks at Lengkong Tiga in 2023, as well as the two Tiong Bahru blocks. For the Serangoon and Lengkong Tiga blocks, HDB received appeals from flat owners and the MP for a re-poll. After careful review, HDB allowed these blocks to re-poll after about one year from the first poll. All four blocks re-polled successfully for the HIP, he said. Checks showed the Serangoon block, which was built in 1984, has eight executive flats. The Lengkong Tiga blocks, built in 1988 and 1989, have between 10 and 55 executive flats each. The two Tiong Bahru blocks – Block 34 Kim Cheng Street and Block 35 Lim Liak Street – had failed to garner enough votes to pass the 75 per cent threshold by a narrow margin of two votes and one vote, respectively. Block 34 comprises 24 units, while Block 35 has 15 units. They were among 29 blocks in the neighbourhood where residents voted on whether to carry out HIP improvements. Voting was successful for the other 27 blocks. All the blocks are four-storey, walk-up flats built in 1949 by Singapore Improvement Trust, the predecessor to HDB. Residents in the two unsuccessful blocks could get a second chance to vote in 2026, depending on the level of support from residents, Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Foo Cexiang told The Straits Times in December 2025. He previously said that a sizeable proportion of units in the neighbourhood were rented out. Several owners were uncontactable or felt little incentive to support the HIP, including those who had just moved in after doing major renovation works. HIP was launched in 2007 to spruce up older housing estates and resolve common maintenance problems, such as spalling concrete. The programme gets carried out after at least 75 per cent of a blocks eligible Singaporean households have voted for it. Permanent resident households are not eligible to vote. Mr Chee said that apart from HIP, HDB supports flat owners who face ceiling leaks and spalling concrete through the Goodwill Repair Assistance scheme, under which HDB subsidises 50 per cent of the repair cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally between the upper- and lower-floor flat owners. Households with seniors can also apply directly to HDB for the installation of senior-friendly fittings under the Enhancement for Active Seniors programme.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/grouping-hdb-blocks-with-fewer-units-together-for-hip-voting-under-consideration-chee-hong-tat
Agencies reviewing plans to develop more vegetation in Serangoon River forest: Alvin Tan,"Jan 14, 2026, 09:30 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:42 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/81f8ce4e56b58ca5b1cf9d98119058011a29e0574c50414829ab4f297fd0b717,A coalition of residents and nature advocates has called for an environmental study for works on Lorong Halus bus depot.ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Environmental issues', 'Ministry of National Development', 'LTA', 'Public transport']","SINGAPORE – Government agencies are reviewing plans to develop more vegetation along the eastern bank of the Serangoon River, Minister of State for National Development Alvin Tan told Parliament on Jan 14.A coalition of residents and nature advocates has called for an environmental study for works onLorong Halus bus depot, which is sited on one of several tracts of woodland on the eastern bank of the river, informally dubbed the Serangoon River forest. Reiterating their call, Workers Party MP Dennis Tan (Hougang) gave a speech in Parliament about the need to rethink the redevelopment and preservation of green spaces in Singapore. In response, Mr Alvin Tan reiterated that the area east of the river, also known as Sungei Serangoon, has been zoned for industrial use since the 1998 Master Plan. He said the land was intended to be progressively developed to bring economic development and jobs closer to residents of nearby towns, such as Hougang and Sengkang, and to future residents of the upcoming towns at Defu andPaya Lebar Air Base. Plots of vegetation along the river stretch from Tampines Road to Serangoon East Dam. The bus depot that serves residents in the area was rezoned and published in the Government Gazette in December 2023, said Mr Alvin Tan, who is also Minister of State for Trade and Industry. It was deemed that an environmental study was not needed because it was not a sensitive nature area, the environmental impact of the depot was limited and its habitats generally had lower ecological value, he added. So this is a considered decision and we will not revisit the matter, he said. Beyond the bus depot, the agencies will review potential development plans for the remaining areas and continue to carefully plan for the provision of greenery and recreation spaces there. Citing the development of Serangoon River forest, Mr Dennis Tan had called for the Government to recognise the ecological premium of established greenery and prioritise green spaces based on their regional function, as part of a slew of suggestions to improve Singapores approach to developing green spaces. As the Government plans the massive new HDB town at the Paya Lebar Air Base site, it must recognise that large parts of the limited existing green spaces within and on the eastern fringe of the airbase will be developed or severely affected by the construction, he said. He suggested that the Government can retain Serangoon River forest to mitigate any heat impact from the future town, instead of relying on artificially created parks. He also called on agencies to clearly demonstrate that they had explored avoiding and minimising the reduction of green spaces, before mitigation measures are proposed. According to him, residents who appealed to the authorities for the bus depot site to be shifted were not given a reason why the bus depot had to be sited in the middle of the forested area between Buangkok East Drive and Tampines Road. A Land Transport Authority (LTA) spokesperson said on Jan 14 in a statement that the bus depot will serve as an operating base for bus services in the east and north-east regions, as the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base is expected to commence from the 2030s. LTA said: New public transport infrastructure needs to be introduced ahead of time to support public transport connectivity to these areas and provide additional capacity in the east and north-east regions for a growing bus fleet to better serve commuters, especially for growing towns and estates, and connect them to employment centres. It was responding to queries from The Straits Times sent in November 2025. The authority said the future Lorong Halus industrial area was assessed to be the most suitable site in the east and north-east regions to meet the requirements of a bus depot, considering factors such as its size, location and availability of other sites. It said measures will be put in place to limit environmental impact and protect any wildlife in the area. These include earth control measures to prevent untreated discharge and sediment from entering water bodies and forested areas, hoarding up the entire worksite, conducting pre-tree felling checks for bird nests and other wildlife before clearing the site. LTA also said it conducts environmental monitoring and compliance checks on its contractor. Areas zoned for business use have catered for adequate buffer between the development and nearby residential premises to minimise nuisance impacts. The bus depot is located 200m from the nearest residential development. A 12m-high temporary noise barrier facing the residential area has also been installed to insulate sound from construction activities, LTA added. When completed, the Lorong Halus bus depot is expected to house at least 550 buses.

Allowing shorter-term renewals will likely amplify peak and trough of COE cycles: Jeffrey Siow,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:45 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:26 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/60edc667c7d7bdf1637dfd195f3f621f9c96c07df99146668af81c12ac77ebf2,"Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow said that besides the needs of existing owners, the interest of those who want to buy a new car also needs to be considered.ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG","['Singapore Parliament', 'COE', 'Ministry of Transport', 'LTA']","SINGAPORE - Allowing the renewal of certificates of entitlement (COEs) for shorter periods than the current five or 10 years will likely amplify the peaks and troughs of the COE supply cycle and reduce the quota available for prospective car owners, said Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow. He was responding in Parliament on Jan 14 to a question by Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang West) about whether shorter-term COE renewal of one or two years could be considered as a potentially more affordable option for owners touse their vehicles beyond 10 years, given the high COE premiums. A COE allows a vehicle to be used for 10 years. The price to renew is the moving average of COE prices over the preceding three months. In 2025, a 10-year COE renewal cost between $92,064 and $116,000. Mr Siow said: We understand the concerns of existing car owners who wish to renew their COEs. However, we need to balance their interests with those who wish to buy a new car. Today, we already allow existing car owners to renew COEs for five years as a concession. If we allow for shorter renewals, its likely to amplify the peak and trough of the COE cycles further. It would mean that more car owners will renew their COEs when prices are high, and this would reduce the supply of new COEs for prospective car owners. So we will not make this move. While a five-year renewal costs half as much as a 10-year renewal, the COE cannot be extended further. When the five-year period lapses, the car must be deregistered and the COE returned to the pool for bidding. Shorter renewal periods could amplify the peak and trough of the COE cycles because more car owners would deregister their vehicles when COE prices are low, or renew their certificates when prices are high. Under the current policy, the main determinant of COE supply is the number of vehicles that are deregistered in the previous four quarters. Ms Poh asked if shorter-term COE renewals could be permitted for commercial vehicles to help small-business owners, such as hawkers, avoid the heavy cost of renewals to keep their vehicles on the road. Mr Siow said he fully understands the pressures small businesses face in an environment of high COE prices. He noted that commercial vehicle owners can already renew COEs for five-year periods repeatedly until the vehicle reaches its statutory lifespan. It is something that, I think, is fair because you also want to allow new businesses that wish to have access to vehicles to be able to compete for COEs. And I think the better approach is for them to be able to bid in the same market, and for the COE to be priced accordingly, he said.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/allowing-shorter-term-renewals-will-likely-amplify-peak-and-trough-of-coe-cycles-jeffrey-siow
Govt close to finalising low-cost retirement investment scheme details: Tan See Leng,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:05 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:29 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/47a5a5aaac4b4c8642027d0e1a9bf23f6bb7ef972be8e2e024a513545c068e21,The CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme is billed as a simple and low-cost investment alternative to the Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme.ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Ministry of Manpower', 'CPF', 'Retirement', 'Financial planning']","SINGAPORE – CPF members who want to invest their savings in a retirement investment scheme,first announced and accepted by the Government in 2016, will have to wait a little longer to do so. The Ministry of Manpower is in the final stages of studying the CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS) and will give updates when it is ready. The LRIS is billed as a simple and low-cost investmentalternative to the Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme (CPFIS) products. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng was responding in Parliament to a question from Jalan Besar GRC MP Shawn Loh, who asked if the delay in implementing the scheme may deprive CPF members of an option to take risks to earn higher expected returns. Mr Loh pointed out that a typical investment portfolio with 65 per cent invested in equities and 35 per cent in bonds had earned 9.5 per cent returns every year over the past five years. Dr Tan said the Government is studying how it can provide further support to CPF members to plan for their retirement. The investment product that will eventually be introduced should strike the right balance between risk and return, he added. The proposed LRIS would be applicable for CPF members who want to invest but feel they lack the financial expertise and/or time and resources to actively manage their investments. Dr Tan said other CPF members can already invest their savings through a number of low-cost funds under the CPFIS for potentially higher returns. According to investment research firm Morningstar, the investment consultant for the CPFIS, all CPFIS funds – unit trusts and investment-linked insurance products – had an average one-year return of 11.78 per cent in Singapore dollar terms for the third quarter ended September 2025. Cumulative returns reached 37.03 per cent over three years, equivalent to a return of 10.74 per cent a year. Acknowledging Mr Lohs comment that time in the market is more important than timing the market, Dr Tan said he fully agrees with him. However, he added that much also depends on how much time each investor has in the market. For instance, if a product was launched recently and an investor had to liquidate his investments during a downturn for his retirement needs, he would have experienced a drop in the investment value. The investor would not have been able to benefit from enough time in the market to ride out the market falls, ultimately impacting his retirement adequacy, Dr Tan said. The penultimate objective has always been to safeguard retirement adequacy, he added. When pressed by Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) on whether there will be an update in 2026, Dr Tan would not be drawn into giving a specific timeframe. We are close to finalising the details, he said, noting that the CPF Board is reviewing the recommendations made by the CPF advisory panel in 2016. Dr Tan added that time has passed and markets have evolved since then, necessitating a deeper look into which suggestions can be incorporated into the LRIS scheme. Professor Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) wanted to find out more about the composition of the investment product and asked if there will be one that is fully geared towards Singapore equities. Dr Tan said the construct of the product would take into account different weightages of global equities and bonds. He added that it will be a glide path, an investment strategy where an investor takes more risks by holding more equities versus bonds when young. Then, as retirement nears, that investor will take less risk by holding more bonds. The investor is essentially gliding towards retirement with the aim of preserving/protecting his CPF savings as he gets older. Apart from investing their CPF savings, members can choose to leave their money in the Ordinary Account (OA) and Special Account (SA) to earn the risk-free rate of return. A CPF member who is below 55 would earn 2.5 per cent on his OA savings and 4 per cent on his SA savings, with an extra 1 per cent on the first $60,000 of combined balances. The extra interest is capped at $20,000 for the OA. CPF members who are 55 and above would earn 2.5 per cent on the OA and 4 per cent on the Retirement Account, with an extra 2 per cent on the first $30,000 of combined balances and an additional 1 per cent on the next $30,000 of combined balances. The extra interest is capped at $20,000 for the OA.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/government-close-to-finalising-low-cost-retirement-investment-scheme-details-tan-see-leng
Parliament deems Pritam Singh unsuitable to continue as Leader of the Opposition,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:03 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 10:17 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/51cb948ed68addf6c5e1387571652dd69b632e6da7412900e209d7190652b809,The decision on whether to retain WP chief Pritam Singh in the Leader of the Opposition post rests with PM Lawrence Wong.PHOTO: MDDI,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Pritam Singh', 'Leader of the Opposition', 'Workers\' Party', 'Raeesah Khan']","SINGAPORE - The House has expressed the view that Workers Party chief Pritam Singh is unsuitable to stay on as the Leader of the Opposition (LO), following his conviction for lying to a parliamentary committee. Following a three-hour debate on Jan 14, the House approved a motion that said Mr Singhs conduct and conviction in relation to then WP MP Raeesah Khanslie in Parliament in 2021meant he had fallen short of the requirements and standards expected of an LO. Hence, Mr Singhs continuation as LO would undermine the standing of Parliament and public confidence in the integrity of Singapores political system, added the motion, which was raised by Leader of the House Indranee Rajah. All 11 WP MPs in the House stood up to record their disagreement, while Non-Constituency MP Eileen Chong was not present. The NMPs and the PAP MPs agreed with the motion. As the position of LO is conferred by the prime minister, the decision on whether to retain Mr Singh in the post rests with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. ST has contacted the Prime Ministers Office for comment. Opening the debate, Ms Indranee noted the High Courts decision on Dec 4, 2025, to uphold Mr Singhs conviction on two counts of lying to the Committee of Privileges (COP). In sum, she said, Mr Singh had guided Ms Khan twice to maintain her lie to Parliament; he lied twice before the COP; and he lied before the court. Mr Singh also lied to the public, and concealed material information from his own party, she added. There are simply too many lies – they pile up, one on top of another, each one to cover up a previous lie, she said. And that is a problem, as Mr Singh is also the Leader of the Opposition. The courts findings meant the matter had come full circle back to Parliament, she added. Ms Indranee said Parliament derives its authority from not only the law, but also the confidence and trust reposed by Singaporeans in its processes and MPs. An MPs lies to Parliament or before its committees are, therefore, not just a personal lapse or a tactical misjudgment. It strikes at the trust Singaporeans place in us... It undermines the high standards of integrity and incorruptibility which make the Singaporean system work, and for which Singapore is known, she said. That is why I have brought this motion before Parliament. Ms Indranee noted that the court had already fined Mr Singh, which dealt with the criminal offences. On Feb 17, 2025, the district courtfined Mr Singh the maximum of $7,000for each of his two charges. The House was not being asked to impose further penalties on Mr Singh, said Ms Indranee. But his conduct and conviction reflect directly on Parliament, and it must decide whether such conduct is acceptable for an MP, and in this case, the LO. The motion also asked the House to affirm that honesty and integrity are fundamental pillars of Singapores parliamentary system, she added. Members are entitled to, and I will argue have an obligation to, express a view on Mr Singhs suitability to continue in the role (of Leader of the Opposition), said Ms Indranee. It will then be for the Prime Minister to decide what to do after that. Speaking after Ms Indranee, Mr Singh said that while he accepted the courts verdict fully and without reservation, he was disappointed with the judgment and did not agree with the findings. A criminal conviction does not negate ones right to assert innocence... In my case, my conscience will always be clear insofar as my conviction on both charges is concerned, he said. The WP chief said his lawyers had tendered evidence to the court that, in their legal opinion, render(ed) a conviction on both charges unsafe. Mr Singh said the Leader of the Opposition appointment was neither written into the Constitution nor written laws, and that he had never hankered for it. Whatever Parliament decides, and as long as I am a Member of Parliament, I will continue my work as an MP on the ground in Aljunied GRC, he said. WP MPs who joined the debate, including Aljunied GRC MPs Sylvia Lim and Gerald Giam, questioned whether the motion was an attempt to further punish Mr Singh, who had already been sentenced by the court and had paid his fines. I believe this motion today does not serve Singaporeans, but is a party political exercise, and I can foresee that our Parliament will slip further down the rule of law rankings on the factor of being able to effectively check government power, said Ms Lim, who is WPs chairwoman. Three NMPs – Ms Kuah Boon Theng, Mr Mark Lee and Dr Neo Kok Beng – participated in the debate, and called on Mr Singh to voluntarily relinquish the title of Leader of the Opposition. Ms Kuah, a senior counsel, noted that professions such as medicine and law have disciplinary tribunals that may take away the right of doctors and lawyers to practise when a member of their fraternity has been convicted of a serious criminal offence, or when a complaint of professional misconduct has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Rounding up the debate, Ms Indranee said the motion went beyond any individual or party, and was about upholding the integrity and standing of Parliament and the standard of conduct of the Republics MPs. We cannot endorse dishonourable conduct or ignore the courts judgment, and we cannot talk about a first-world Parliament and effective checks and balances if fundamental values of honesty, integrity and accountability are not upheld, she said. We have a solemn duty to make sure that politics in Singapore remains upright and honourable.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/parliament-deems-pritam-singh-unsuitable-to-continue-as-leader-of-the-opposition

In a speech that lasted nearly 20 minutes, the WP chief disagreed that his conduct was dishonourable and unbecoming, and addressed the six points of the motion moved by Leader of the House Indranee Rajah. Ms Indranee said that while the court had already fined Mr Singh, the lies which gave rise to his offence occurred in Parliament, and were told to Parliaments Committee of Privileges. His conduct and conviction reflect on the standing and integrity of the House, she added. Rising to respond, Mr Singh (Aljunied GRC) said he had lifted the party whip, meaning WP MPs could vote as they consider fit on the motion. He noted that he could not take his case beyond the High Court whichdismissed his appeal, and said he was disappointed with the judgment and did not agree with it. Mr Singh said he agreed with the first and sixth resolution of the motion, which called on MPs to affirm that honesty and integrity are fundamental pillars of Singapores parliamentary and political system; and to uphold their duty to respect and abide by the law. The future (WP MPs) envisage for Singapore does not call for the destruction of the stable and sensible politics Singaporeans seek to uphold in Singapore, he said. He rejected the other resolutions, including the second one which called on the House to note the findings of the High Court and Committee of Privileges. The committee hadfound that Mr Singh had guided former WP MP Raeesah Khan to continue with her lie to Parliament. The findings by the committee went much further than the charges levelled against him, Mr Singh said. Raeesah Khan was not told to take a lie to the grave on Aug 8, 2021, he said, noting that this was the anchoring piece of documentary evidence that, along with other circumstantial evidence, led to the trial judges conclusion that this statement was made by himself. My conscience remains clear, as it will forever, that this was not said by me to Khan at any point in time, he added. He also rejected the third resolution which stated his behaviour was dishonourable and unbecoming as an MP. There are those who believe that whatever our courts decide, a convicted person is unable to retain their belief that they are innocent insofar as a conviction is concerned, he said, as he referenced now-President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Mr Tharman was convicted in 1994 under the Official Secrets Act for negligence in allowing sensitive government data to be communicated to the media. Noting that Mr Tharman said in a 2023 media interview that they got the wrong man, Mr Singh added: A criminal conviction does not negate ones right to assert innocence. A finding of guilt by the courts did not undermine the Presidents personal view of his conviction. In my case, my conscience will always be clear, insofar as my conviction on both charges is concerned. Mr Singh moved on to reject the fourth resolution, which called on MPs to consider that his conduct renders him unsuitable to remain as Leader of the Opposition, and that his continuation in the role would undermine public confidence in Singapores political system. He noted that the appointment is not a constitutional or statutory one. Following the 2020 General Election, then Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loongdesignated Mr Singh as the formal Leader of the Opposition, after the WP won 10 seats. I have never operated on the assumption that the Leader of the Opposition appointment is a given, nor have I hankered for it, said Mr Singh. I have done my best to work with my colleagues to advance the interests of Singaporeans with the Workers Party as a responsible opposition through the office. He also rejected resolution five, which called on the House to consider the implications of the case on WP MP Sylvia Lim and former MP Faisal Manap separately. Mr Singh said no action should be taken against Ms Lim and Mr Faisal, as he did not agree with the judgment and the findings of the Committee of Privileges. The committee had found that both Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had lied under oath bydenying that they had told Ms Khan to hide her untruthin an August 2021 meeting. Concluding, he thanked Singapore and Singaporeans for their support. He added: In my case, whatever Parliament decides, and as long as I am a Member of Parliament, I will continue my work as an MP on the ground in Aljunied GRC, and I will continue to advocate for Singaporeans in Parliament to the best of my abilities, as I have for the last 15 years. Ms Lim (Aljunied GRC), who is WP chairwoman, said there were differences between Mr Singhs case and other cases where WP MPs have resigned over their misconduct. Ms Indranee had contrasted the WPs swift actions against its former MPs Raeesah Khan and Leon Perera with its handling of Mr Singhs case. In her speech, Ms Lim said that while the other MPs had admitted their wrongdoings, Mr Singh has maintained his innocence, contested the charges and appealed against his conviction. Given the different circumstances, she asked whether Parliament should subject Mr Singh to a further punishment beyond the fines meted out by the courts, by initiating a removal of him from his position as Leader of the Opposition. Is this necessary, or is this a political exercise? she asked. Ms Lim also responded to Ms Indranees point that Parliament could not wait for the WP to act on the court ruling. WP said on Jan 3 thata disciplinary panel would be formedto assess if Mr Singh breached the partys Constitution, and that it would need to come to a conclusion within three months. Although (Ms Indranee) says that she cannot wait for us, thats fine. But the fact is that we have our processes, and the processes will take their course, Ms Lim said. She also referred to the resolution in the motion which called on MPs to note that the High Courts judgment and COP findings have implications for herself and Mr Faisal, and for the matter to be considered separately. She asked Ms Indranee to elaborate on what it meant and how long she and Mr Faisal will need to wait for this to be addressed. Ms Lim noted that there were several references to her in Mr Singhs appeal judgment, but said these were based on the prosecutions evidence and that she and Mr Faisal were not called as witnesses. We had no opportunity to present our side of the story to the court. The courts findings cannot be held against us, she said. Mr Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) said that by seeking to remove Mr Singh as Leader of the Opposition, the motion appeared to be imposing a further political penalty on top of the fines he has paid after the High Court dismissed his appeal. Noting that the position of the Leader of the Opposition was a role constituted at the Prime Ministers prerogative, Mr Giam asked if the Prime Minister was seeking the views of Parliament to make his executive decision. He added that WP was vastly outnumbered in Parliament, with 12 MPs compared with the PAPs 87. The outcome of this motion may be a foregone conclusion due to the mathematical reality of this House, but the moral weight of the decision rests on every member, he said. All 11 WP MPs present in the House subsequently voted against the motion, which Parliament agreed to.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/pritam-singh-rejects-motion-against-him-says-his-conscience-remains-clear

The Mandai Wildlife Group, in a statement on Jan 14, said the vulture – native to mountain ranges in northern India – was rescued by the National Parks Board (NParks) and moved to Mandai Wildlife Group for treatment on Jan 3. It was found in bad health near Neo Tiew Crescent in the Kranji area. Checks found that the vulture, among the worlds largest birds of prey, was severely underweight, weak and heavily infested with parasites. It was later found to have anaemia, or a shortage of red blood cells. It also had muscle injuries and its kidneys were not working properly, and it was placed in intensive care. Mandai Wildlife Group veterinarian Charlene Yeong said: Despite these efforts, the vultures condition deteriorated on the fifth day. The Mandai Wildlife Group veterinary team and NParks made a joint decision, the statement said, to euthanise the bird on Jan 7. A post-mortem was later carried out to find out what caused the birds declining health. After that, its carcass was transferred to Lee Kong Chian National History Museum for education and research. The museum is in the National University of Singapores Kent Ridge campus. The museums assistant senior curator for birds, Dr Tan Yen Yi, said: This is the first specimen of the species for the museum and for Singapore. This rare specimen is a valuable addition to Singapores natural heritage collection. Dr Yeong said recentsightings of Himalayan vulturesin Singapore are likely birds that have strayed from their usual range. Younger vultures tend to venture farther and can end up in areas with fewer food sources linked to habitat loss, she added. On Jan 11, aHimalayan vulture spotted along the ECPwas rescued by the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres). The bird, which was taken into Acres care, was found to be dehydrated, and generally weak and exhausted from the long voyage.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/rare-himalayan-vulture-found-in-kranji-put-down-after-health-worsened-mandai-wildlife-group

New workgroup to review training for private-hire car licence after Autobahn saga,"Jan 14, 2026, 06:25 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 07:22 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f89ca287dc70290d514ddf058eea672870cd0a27f472f7a1bba40924c62807d0,The livelihoods of many private-hire drivers were affected after creditors repossessed vehicles from Autobahn Rent A Car in December.ST PHOTO: AZMI ATHNI,"['Singapore Parliament', 'Ride-hailing apps', 'Gig economy', 'Private car sharing']","Follow our Parliament live coverage here. SINGAPORE – Following the abrupt repossession of vehicles by Autobahn Rent A Car that left hirers stranded, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will look at helping drivers understand rental contracts as part of training to become a private-hire car driver. Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling said in Parliament on Jan 14 that LTA will be forming a new workgroup to review the subjects covered in the vocational licence training to drive a private-hire car. The review will incorporatethe Platform Workers Act, which took effect on Jan 1, and the relevant protection for workers, said Ms Sun, adding that LTA is open to including education on contractual matters in the training curriculum. In response to Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Punggol GRC), who asked if LTA should consider regulating owners of large rental car fleets to protect private-hire drivers, Ms Sun said that doing so could result in raising the cost of private-hire cars, which would likely be passed on to drivers and passengers. Ms Yeo, who is also adviser to the National Private Hire Vehicles Association (NPHVA) and National Taxi Association (NTA), and assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), said drivers often face onerous contractual terms when renting cars. These include unclear clauses governing termination and having to pay high fees for vehicle damage. In December, creditors repossessed vehicles from Autobahn Rent A Car after the companyfailed to get temporary protection from the High Court. This led to drivers losing their vehicles, affecting their livelihood. The drivers also had difficulty recovering their rental deposits from the company. Autobahn is reported to have a fleet of 1,700 vehicles. On Jan 6, the company said through its lawyer that it wassuspending operations. Ms Sun said: We are deeply sympathetic towards the plight of drivers who are affected by the Autobahn business failure. We recognise the impact large car companies have on drivers livelihoods when such companies become financially distressed or insolvent. In response to the situation, Ms Sun said LTA worked with NTA, NPHVA and fleet operators to help affected drivers secure other vehicles and earning opportunities. NTUC also provided legal advice to members who needed help. Ms Sun said providing such support does not require fleet owners to be regulated. NPHVA, an affiliate of NTUC, told The Straits Times on Jan 13 that it is working with LTA to strengthen safeguards for private-hire drivers who rent cars. Mr Raven Lee, NPHVAs executive secretary, said the association is advocating clearer and fairer rental contracts, for terms like late payment, termination and replacement vehicle arrangements. Beyond contract terms, NPHVA is calling for safeguards to be put in place to protect our drivers in the event that car rental companies face financial distress or insolvency, he said. Given drivers dependence on rental vehicles to earn a living, rental companies should have contingency arrangements to prevent sudden service disruptions, including clarity on the handling of vehicles, deposits and existing contracts. As part of training to be licensed as a private-hire driver, the current curriculum includes topics like road safety practices and planning routes using mapping and navigational tools. Labour chief and MP Ng Chee Meng (Jalan Kayu) said affected drivers were concerned that they would not be able to recover rental deposits paid to the leasing companies, which can range from $500 to $1,000. He asked if protective measures, like ring-fencing the deposits to protect the drivers interest if the company becomes insolvent, can be considered. In response, Ms Sun said that putting in such a requirement would raise the compliance burden for the companies, which would eventually be borne by drivers and passengers in the form of higher costs. That said, I recognise the difficulties that the current set of drivers who are impacted by the Autobahn situation face, she said. The matter is now before the High Court, but because these drivers are unsecured creditors, it is likely that they will face difficulties getting their deposits. This is why I think, moving forward, we need to work closely with the associations to see how to better equip drivers about what they understand about their rental contracts. Labour MP Patrick Tay (Pioneer) asked if theshort-term relief fundmanaged by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management could be extended to affected drivers, to which Ms Sun said that she would consult the Ministry of Manpower.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/new-workgroup-to-review-training-for-private-hire-car-licence-after-autobahn-saga
Over one in four eligible platform workers opted in to make higher CPF contributions as at Sept 2025,"Jan 14, 2026, 06:15 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 10:10 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1ef78e16c22e01b99aaab87b22c8fc650ce119b4e3750d883919e390488476d9,"Platform workers born before Jan 1, 1995, may choose to opt in to make higher CPF contributions beyond the mandatory MediSave payments.ST PHOTO: BRIAN TEO","['Singapore Parliament', 'Ministry of Manpower', 'CPF', 'Gig economy', 'Food delivery services']","SINGAPORE –For Mr Mohamed Farouq, cash in handfrom his passengers is more important than making CPF contributions. Its difficult because cash is what I need at the moment, said the private-hire car driver, 49, a father of three. Mr Farouq said choosing to make CPF contributions feels like he is docking his own pay. As it is, its hard to put money aside, he added. He said he is not overly worried about his CPF savings, saying: I have some savings and I have a plan. He aims to leave driving later in 2026, when a three-year lease on his car ends. He has completed a course in phlebotomy – the process of drawing blood from a vein –and intends to switch to a job in the healthcare sector. Driving is not something I planned to do long-term... its quite impossible (to earn a living), he added. Mr Farouq is among platform workers born before Jan 1, 1995, who may choose to opt in to make higher CPF contributions beyond the mandatory MediSave payments. While there is no deadline for older platform workers to subscribe to making higher CPF contributions, the decision is irreversible once made. Under the Platform Workers Act, it is mandatory for younger platform workers born on or after Jan 1, 1995, to contribute more to their CPF accounts. Since the Act took effect onJan 1, 2025, about26,500of99,200platform workers born before Jan 1, 1995, or27 per cent, have committed to higher CPF contributions as atSeptember 2025. The opt-in rate is higher for those who rely on platform work as their main or only source of income at32 per cent, or some19,100out of59,800platform workers. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng provided these figures onJan 12in response to a parliamentary question fromMP Yeo Wan Ling (Punggol GRC). As at September 2025, there are7,400platform workers who do not rely on platform work as their main or only source of income, but have opted in, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) told The Straits Times. Ms Yeo, who is also executive secretary of the National Transport Workers Union, had asked how many eligible platform workers enrolled for higher CPF contribution rates, if the reasons for those who did not do so were recorded, and what those reasons were. Dr Tan said the MOM does not collect data on why workers choose not to do so. We will continue to work with platform operators and platform work associations to reach out to platform workers to encourage more to opt in, he added. To address concerns over lower take-home pay, MOM said in December 2024 that lower-income platform workers who opt in will receive monthly cash payments to offset the year-on-year increase in CPF contributions. These payments will cover 100 per cent of the increase in 2025, tapering to 75 per cent in 2026, 50 per cent in 2027 and 25 per cent in 2028. Older platform workers who do not opt in will continue to contribute only to MediSave and will not receive CPF contributions from platform operators, MOM said. MsCarmen Ortega, who has been a private-hire vehicle driver for more than10years, chose to contribute more to her CPF accounts. The40-year-old said that she feels it is more worth it to do so because platform companies will need to contribute their share to her CPF savings, which will help to fund her purchase of a three- or four-roomHousing Board flat in the future. Similarly, MrKelvin Lam– a private-hire vehicle driver for adecade– sees higher CPF contributions as a long-term investment, since they include top-ups from platform companies, which earn compound interest over time. I do not want to be a burden to society in my old age – with no savings, no accommodation and no money for medical fees, added the50-year-old. He said there may be a significant number of platform workers who will retire without enoughCPF savings, and he feels that they may be forced to live from hand to mouth and without a roof over their heads. On the other hand, delivery riderSeth Ongis not planning toregister to contribute more to his CPF accounts, as he believes he would need to work even longer hours to earn the same amount of money before the deduction of CPF contributions. Noting that he already has a family home fully paid for by his late father, the34-year-old said saving for a distant future is a luxury for those who are well-off. He said he would prefer to have more cash in hand, especially because it is really unpleasant to have a portion of his already inconsistent income deducted for CPF contributions. In response to queries from ST, Ms Yeo said NTUC and its affiliated platform work associations have been actively engaging platform workers on the ground to help them understand the long-term benefits of choosing higher CPF contributions for housing and retirement. Ms Yeo added that some workers worry opting in could affect how platforms allocate earnings and incentives to them, even though platforms are not allowed to do so. Others prefer to keep more cashavailable. There are also those taking a wait-and-see approach before deciding, she noted. She added that NTUC and platform work associations are also working with the CPF Board to help platform workers better understand how CPF works so they can make informed decisions. When asked if these opt-in figures are above or below expectations, Ms Yeo said NTUC will continue watching this closely to ensure platform workers queries are addressed and that the roll-out of the higher CPF contributions is fair– given that they are now going into the second year of opting in. This is ultimately about our platform workers long-term retirement and housing needs, and it is important that platform workers make an informed choice, she added.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/over-one-in-four-platform-workers-opted-in-for-higher-cpf-contributions-as-at-sept-2025

According to a report released earlierin Januaryby the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, babies conceived through medical support such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or artificial insemination accounted for 15.1 per cent of all newborns in 2024, up from 8.7 per cent in 2019. In headcount terms, babies born through infertility treatment rose by about 37 per cent, from roughly 26,000 in 2019 to 36,000 in 2024. The faster growth in the proportion reflects a broader demographic shift. During the same period, South Koreas total number of newborns declined from 302,000 to 238,000. Total infertility treatment costs recorded by the Health Ministry increased from 227.7 billion won (S$198.66 million) to 555.5 billion won between 2018 and 2024. The trend coincides with delayed marriage in the country. The average age at first marriage has continued to rise for both men and women, a factor that affects fertility in both genders. According to the Ministry of Data and Statistics, the average age at first marriage for men increased from 33.15 to 33.86 between 2018 and 2024, while the figure for women rose from 30.4 to 31.55 over the same period. Older age groups now account for a growing share of fertility care recipients. The proportion of patients in their 40s rose from 25.5 per cent to 40.3 per cent during the same period. In response to rising demand, the government has expanded its support for infertility treatment as part of efforts to address rapid population ageing. By easing eligibility standards and increasing the number of subsidised treatment cycles, the number of supported treatment cases grew by 142.6 per cent, from 92,000 in 2020 to 223,000 in 2024. The related budget expanded 3.5-fold to 145.7 billion won. The data showed that the success rate of infertility treatment stood at 30.9 per cent for IVF and 17.5 per cent for artificial insemination as at 2022.

Unidentified drones struck at least two oil tankers in the Black Sea on Tuesday, including one chartered by U.S. oil major Chevron, as they sailed toward a terminal on the Russian coast to load oil from Kazakhstan. Kazakhstans foreign ministry said in a statement that three tankers were hit en route to the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) in the Black Sea. On November 29, drones also attacked CPCs exporting equipment, resulting in a fall in oil exports via the outlet. The increasing frequency of such incidents highlights the growing risks to the functioning of international energy infrastructure, the ministry said in a statement. We therefore call upon our partners to engage in close cooperation to develop joint measures aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future, it added. Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday that the Matilda tanker, sailing under the Maltese flag, came under attack by two Ukrainian strike drones at a distance of about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the city of Anapa in Russias Krasnodar region. Ukraine did not comment on the incident. Shareholders in CPCs 1,500-km (930-mile) pipeline include Kazakhstans state-owned oil company KazMunayGas, Russias Lukoil and units of U.S. oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil. Russian terminals on the Black Sea handle more than 2% of global crude. Its waters, which are shared by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and Turkey, as well as Russia and Ukraine, are also crucial for the shipment of grain.

Eugene Hoshiko/Pool via REUTERS","['Japan', 'Innovation']","TOKYO, Jan 14 - Japans Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve parliaments lower house next week, triggering a national election to decide all 465 seats in her first major election test since taking office in October. She will announce details of the election on Monday, ruling Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Shunichi Suzuki said. WHY CALL AN ELECTION NOW? Japans first female premier inherited a battered government, with the LDP having lost its majority in both houses of parliament after disgruntled voters punished it over rising prices and a funding scandal. By calling a snap election now, she hopes to capitalise on a surge in public support for a new leader who has promised to spur economic growth, tackle cost-of-living concerns and tighten immigration rules. Some media polls have put the LDPs support at more than 60%, giving Takaichi an opportunity to restore its majority in the more powerful lower chamber. A poll of 1,213 people published by public broadcaster NHK on January 13 showed she had the backing of 62% of voters. Even if she bags a lower-house majority, however, Takaichi will still have to govern with a minority in the upper house, which she cannot dissolve. Voters elect half of its members every three years and the next election is not due until 2028. WHAT WOULD A STRONG RESULT DELIVER? A decisive victory would strengthen her hand within the LDP and reduce her reliance on smaller political parties to pass key legislation. That, in turn, could allow her to push ahead with plans to boost government spending to revive economic growth and sharply increase defence outlays under a revised national security strategy amid heightened tension with Japans powerful neighbour China. The shift could mark a further step from Japans post-war pacifist constraints, including a long-standing principle that bars nuclear weapons from the countrys territory. With prices still rising and the yens value against the U.S. dollar sliding, the cost of living is likely to dominate the election campaign. In the NHK poll 45% of respondents said that was their main concern, followed by diplomacy and national security at 16%. Her government has proposed record spending of $770 billion for the next fiscal year, a move that has unnerved investors in one of the worlds most indebted industrial economies. WHATS UP FOR GRABS? All 465 seats in the lower house will be contested, 289 in single-member districts and 176 through proportional representation. A simple majority requires 233 seats. The LDP currently controls 199 seats in the chamber and governs with the support of its coalition partner the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, which has 34 seats. The main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), has 148 seats in the house, followed by the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) with 27. Komeito, which quit its 26-year coalition with the LDP after Takaichi became leader, has 24 seats. Attention may also focus on how Takaichi fares against the far-right Sanseito Party, whose calls for tighter immigration controls siphoned votes from the LDP in last Julys upper house election, where it won 14 seats. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? By dissolving the lower house on January 23, Takaichi will trigger an official campaign period of around two weeks before voting day. If the LDP and Ishin secure a majority, she would be confirmed as prime minister in a special parliamentary session. If not, she may be forced to seek new coalition partners or the support of other smaller parties, a setback that would weaken her authority.

Even if Yoon is sentenced to death in the Feb 19 ruling and the sentence is later upheld by the Supreme Court, it remains highly unlikely he would be executed. South Korea is considered a de facto death penalty abolitionist, with no executions since December 1997, despite around 60 people remaining on death row. While largely symbolic, the harshest possible sentence for Yoon could have significant implications in a country long haunted by memories of military coups, dictatorship and repression prior to democratisation in 1987. The special counsels request is symbolically rich, even though Yoon is highly unlikely to be executed, said Dr Mason Richey, professor of international studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. The message is that the judicial system and government take abuse of martial law – and the potential for its tyrannical misuse – with utmost seriousness. Another expert echoed this view, emphasising the importance of sending a strong message that any threat to democracy is intolerable. Given the gravity of the situation, it seems appropriate to request the maximum sentence, even though the likelihood of execution is virtually zero, said Dr Benjamin Engel, assistant professor of Korean studies at Dankook University. The request and any subsequent sentence would signal that Yoons self-coup attempt is completely unacceptable in a democratic South Korea. Others, however, questioned whether the death penalty is appropriate, regardless of the seriousness of Yoons alleged actions. (Yoon) must be held fully accountable for his abuse of power and insurrection, said an executive of the European Chamber of Commerce in Korea, speaking to The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. However, the special counsels call for the death penalty feels disproportionate to the crime. The executive added that a lesser sentence such as life imprisonment, the minimum punishment for insurrection, would be more in line with modern South Korean values. US communications professional Spencer Waters, based in Busan, warned that pursuing the harshest penalty could worsen social division, especially amid claims the judiciary is under political pressure. Allegations of insurrection must be investigated thoroughly and independently, free from political influence, Mr Waters said. But seeking the harshest punishment risks deepening polarisation and turning the legal process into a symbolic or retaliatory act. A human rights group advocating for the abolition of capital punishment also argued against the death penalty, regardless of how serious the crime. No one is above the law, including a former president, but seeking the death penalty is a step backward, said Amnesty Internationals death penalty adviser Chiara Sangiorgio in a statement on Jan 13. Yoonsimposition of martial law in December 2024endangered fundamental human rights, prompting prosecutors to seek his execution. While accountability is vital, the death penalty undermines the very principles of human rights and dignity that the rule of law is meant to protect. The special counsels request and the courts upcoming decision in February could reshape South Koreas political landscape just five months ahead of local elections. It could also deal a potential blow to the conservative People Power Party ahead of the June elections, as Yoons sentencing could split the party. A death sentence may be Yoons final disgrace, but it could also turn him into a martyr among hardline conservatives, said Dr Engel. He noted that since the party has not completely severed ties with Yoon, internal strife between moderates and extremists is likely to persist. If the extremists prevail, the PPP may struggle in Junes elections. Dr Richey said Yoons sentencing would likely have a limited impact on overall voter sentiment. However, he noted that a conviction could slightly suppress conservative turnout if it causes confusion or division within the partys messaging.

Ms Takaichi is considering holding the election on Feb 8, two ruling party lawmakers said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. We need to seek a fresh mandate, Mr Shunichi Suzuki, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), told reporters after meeting Ms Takaichi on Jan 14, adding that she would outline her plans on Jan 19. Japans first female prime minister will be looking to ride a surge in public support since coming to office in October, despite triggering a major diplomatic row with powerful neighbour China. Mr Suzuki said the ballot would allow voters to judge the LDPs new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin. Ms Takaichi formed the alliance in 2025 after breaking with Komeito, the LDPs longstanding and more liberal partner. One reason for dissolving Parliament is that the previous election was under the LDP–Komeito government; the public has not yet rendered a verdict on the change in our coalition partner, Mr Suzuki added. The vote will also test public appetite for Ms Takaichis plans to boost government spending to revive growth and increase defence outlays under a revised national security strategy, Mr Suzuki said. Reports last week that she was considering a snap poll triggered a sell-off in Japans yen and government bonds as investors fretted over how one of the worlds most indebted advanced economies would pay for her fiscal expansion. The election also comes amid the worst dispute in more than a decade between Asias two biggest economies. Ms Takaichi said in 2025 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute an existential threat to Japan – remarks Beijing has demanded she retract. She has not done so, prompting Chinese countermeasures including advising its citizens not to travel to Japan and issuing a curb on dual-use exports. The election would presumably be won on her handling of the economy, said Mr Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst for North-east Asia with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. The upside for Takaichi of a convincing victory, though, is that it would also signal to Beijing that she is here to stay and Chinas suite of coercive tactics are not going to succeed in driving her from office. With the timing of the election likely to complicate passage of the 2026 Budget before the fiscal year ends in March, Ms Takaichi is considering a temporary spending plan, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo","['Greenland', 'Foreign policy', 'Donald Trump']","COPENHAGEN, Jan 14 - Greenlands Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt and her Danish counterpart Lars Lokke Rasmussen are meeting U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday, amid President Donald Trumps repeated threats to seize control of Greenland. Analysts have described it as the most important meeting in modern Danish history. These are the two ministers working to navigate the crisis on behalf of the Kingdom of Denmark: GREENLANDS FOREIGN MINISTER, VIVIAN MOTZFELDT Vivian Motzfeldt, 53, grew up as a sheep farmers daughter in southern Greenland. At seven years old she moved to a boarding school and when she was 17 she went to the United States on a student exchange programme, according to an interview she gave to daily Sermitsiaq in 2019. Her official resume shows she worked as a teacher at various Greenlandic schools from 1997-2014 before entering politics. She is married and has four children. Motzfeldt has been serving as minister of foreign affairs since 2022 and previously served as speaker of Inatsisartut, the parliament of Greenland and as the chair of Greenlands constitutional committee. She appears to be a pragmatic politician who understands the power game, Mette Marie Staehr Harder, assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen who has analysed Motzfeldts social media posts, told Reuters. Motzfeldt has not hesitated to publicly criticise Denmark when she believes Greenlandic interests are sidelined. If she has a case, she is not afraid to challenge whoever it may be, Harder said. Motzfeldt has repeatedly made clear that Greenland does not want to be part of the United States but is open to more cooperation. My greatest hope is that the meeting will lead to a normalisation of our relationship, Sermitsiaq quoted her as saying on Wednesday. DENMARKS FOREIGN MINISTER, LARS LOKKE RASMUSSEN Lars Lokke Rasmussen, 61, a two-time prime minister and a former finance minister, is the ultimate veteran of Danish politics, serving as the Nordic countrys foreign minister since 2022. A law degree holder and widely regarded as a skilled negotiator, he led a centre-right coalition government from 2009 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2019 as head of Denmarks Liberal Party. He eventually resigned from the Liberals after his government lost the 2019 election, forming a new centrist group, the Moderate Party, of which he is now the leader. A strong advocate for the rule of law at home and abroad, Rasmussen adheres to a pragmatic idealism in foreign policy, meaning that Denmark should approach the world as it is, realistically and pragmatically, while maintaining principles of democracy and human rights. He has weathered controversies during his decades in politics, including over the spending of party money on drinks, taxis and underwear, but bouncing back each time with a down-to-earth image appreciated by many Danes.

Russian national Vladimir Motin, captain of the Solong that hit the anchored Stena Immaculate tanker in March 2025, tried to take his vessel off autopilot shortly before the crash but was unsuccessful, his lawyer said. Motin, 59, is on trial at the Old Bailey charged with the gross negligence manslaughter of Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found but is presumed dead. Motin has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer James Leonard said Motin had a duty to avoid the collision and that there was no doubt that the collision caused the sad death of Mr Pernia. On the simple basis of failing to avoid a collision with the Stena Immaculate, there is no doubt that the defendant was at fault, Leonard added. But he told the jury they would have to consider whether any fault by Motin actually caused the collision and whether it was grossly negligent as compared with something less than that. CAPTAIN SAYS HE TRIED TO CHANGE COURSE Motin was aware of the Stena Immaculate from the Solongs radar from at least nine nautical miles (16.7 kilometers) away while the Solong was controlled by autopilot, Leonard said. He added that, when the Solong was around one nautical mile away from the Stena Immaculate, Motin tried to take the Solong out of autopilot to manually change course. There is no dispute that, had he changed course in the way he intended, there would have been no collision, Leonard said. He told the jury that they would have to consider why Motin waited until the Solong was one nautical mile away and whether that was reasonable. Prosecutor Tom Little said on Tuesday that Motin, who has pleaded not guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, did absolutely nothing to prevent the collision. The trial is expected to conclude next month. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/captain-tried-to-change-course-before-fatal-tanker-crash-uk-jury-told

REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier","['Parliament', 'Budget', 'EU']","PARIS, Jan 14 - The French government faces two no-confidence votes on Wednesday that are not expected to pass, which would clear the way for the government to focus on yet another budget showdown in the coming days. The no-confidence motions, filed by the far-right National Rally (RN) and hard-left France Unbowed (LFI), aim to protest the European Unions trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc. Despite French opposition, EU member states last week approved the signing of the long-debated deal with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The RN and LFI accuse the government of not doing enough to block it. The French executive never really gave itself the means to prevent the adoption of this agreement, LFI said. VOTES IN THE AFTERNOON The two motions will be examined by the lower house of parliament in the afternoon. The Socialist Party has ruled out backing them and the conservative The Republicans said they would not vote to censure the government over Mercosur. A motion of censure in France achieves nothing. Its now in the European Parliament that the battle will take place, The Republicans leader Bruno Retailleau told Europe 1/CNews. Government insiders said Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu will let the no-confidence motions run their course before returning to the fraught budget talks. NEXT ON THE AGENDA: TOUGH BUDGET TALKS One of several options regarding the countrys 2026 budget would be for the prime minister to invoke Article 49.3 of the Constitution to push through the finance bill without a vote, after negotiating a text with all groups except the RN and LFI, one government source said. That would almost certainly lead to more motions of no confidence. Lawmakers are eager to end weeks of wrangling over the budget, even if it means the countrys deficit remains near 5%, sources said. President Emmanuel Macron, according to his entourage, wants a budget adopted in January and is neutral on how to achieve that. HUNG PARLIAMENT Government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said on Tuesday that nothing is excluded to pass the budget. Lecornu, who last week warned of a possible dissolution of parliament if his government fell, later softened his tone: I want neither censure nor dissolution. My fight is for stability and against disorder, he told Le Parisien. Frances political situation has been fragile since 2022, when Macron lost his majority in parliament. His problems worsened when he unexpectedly called early legislative elections in mid-2024, only to deliver a hung parliament split between three distinct ideological blocs: his centre-right alliance, the left, and the far-right RN.

REUTERS/Yves Herman","['Parliament', 'Trade', 'United States']","BRUSSELS, Jan 14 - The European Parliament is considering putting on hold the European Unions implementation of the trade deal struck with the United States in protest over threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to seize Greenland. The European Parliament has been debating legislative proposals to remove many of the EUs import duties on U.S. goods - the bulk of the trade deal with the U.S. - and to continue zero duties for U.S. lobsters, initially agreed with Trump in 2020. It was due to set its position in votes on January 26-27, which the MEPs said should now be postponed. Leading members of the cross-parliamentary trade committee met to discuss the issue on Wednesday morning and decide whether to postpone the vote. In the end, they took no decision and settled on reconvening next week. A parliamentary source said left-leaning and centrist groups favoured taking action, such as a postponement. A group of 23 lawmakers also urged the EU assemblys president Roberta Metsola on Wednesday to freeze work on the agreement as long as the U.S. administration continued its threats to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. If we go through and approve a deal that Trump has seen as a personal victory, while he makes claims for Greenland and refuses to rule out any manner in which to achieve this, it will be easily seen as rewarding him and his actions, the letter drafted by Danish lawmaker Per Clausen said. Signatories were mainly fellow members of Clausens Left Group, but also included centre-left Social Democrats and Greens. Greens lawmaker Anna Cavazzini said the only argument in favour of the deal was to bring stability. Trumps actions show again and again that chaos is his only offer, she said. French lawmaker Valerie Hayer, head of the centrist Renew Europe group, said on Tuesday the EU should consider holding off a vote if Trumps threats continued. Many lawmakers have complained that the U.S. trade deal is lopsided, with the EU required to cut most import duties while the U.S. sticks to a broad rate of 15%. However, freezing the deal risks angering Trump, which could lead to higher U.S. tariffs. The Trump administration has also ruled out any concessions, such as cutting tariffs on spirits or steel, until the deal is in place.

Orban, in power since 2010, is facing a strong challenger for the first time in the April 12 parliamentary vote, with the outcome having major implications not only for Hungary but for Europe and its far-right political forces. The polls show Fidesz is still struggling to recoup ground despite numerous voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation. Tisza, a centre-right party led by former government insider Peter Magyar, has extended its lead over Fidesz to 12 percentage points, up from a 10-point lead in a November survey, pollster Median said in an article published by news website hvg.hu. Magyars party, which was only launched in 2024, had the support of 51% of decided voters, up from 50% in November. Support for Fidesz dropped to 39% from 40% two months ago, according to the survey conducted between January 7 and 13. Median researchers said Tisza was mostly luring away voters from other opposition parties, not Fidesz, but the ruling party was failing to lure new voters despite fiscal giveaways and efforts to tap into voter fears about the Ukraine war. Apart from the two main parties, only the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) party has a chance to reach the 5% threshold for getting into parliament, the Median survey showed. A second poll published on Wednesday, conducted by Idea Institute, put support for Tisza at 48% among decided voters, 10 points ahead of Fidesz. That survey was conducted between December 31 and January 6. Magyar has said he would keep Hungary firmly anchored in the European Union and NATO and seek pragmatic relations with Russia, in contrast to Orban, who counts U.S. President Donald Trump among his allies, has maintained cordial ties with Moscow and has often clashed with Brussels.

U.S. President Donald Trump redesignated Nigeria a country of particular concern in November and promised military action if it failed to crack down on the killing of Christians. The Nigerian government says it is working hard to tackle Islamist and other groups which have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians and that there is no systematic persecution. It hired Washington-based consulting firm DCI Group for an initial six months for $4.5 million, with a similar amount due for another six months, a filing with the U.S. Department of Justice dated December 18 and posted on the DOJ website showed. DCI and the Nigerian presidency did not immediately comment on the filing, which appeared in Nigerian media on Wednesday. The agreement says DCI would help the Nigerian government in communicating its actions to protect Nigerians (sic) Christian communities and maintaining U.S support in countering West African jihadist groups and other destabilizing elements. Nigeria has faced a long-running Islamist insurgency in the northeast, armed kidnapping gangs in the northwest and clashes between largely Muslim cattle herders and mostly Christian farmers in the middle belt of the country. The U.S. military carried out an airstrike in northwest Nigeria on Christmas Day, which Trump said had killed multiple Islamic State militants. Trump said in an interview with the New York Times published last week that there could be more strikes if Christians are killed. On Tuesday, the U.S. militarys Africa Command said it had delivered critical military supplies to Nigeria to bolster the West African countrys operations, in a sign of increased cooperation between Washington and Abuja.

The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) takes a whole-of-society approach, involving the public, businesses and community organisations, to enable seniors, including persons living with dementia, to move about safely and independently. One such initiative is the Dementia Go-To Points (GTPs) located at MRT stations, bus interchanges, community centres, eldercare services and retail partners. GTPs serve as accessible touchpoints in the community, where front-line staff are trained to assist seniors, and persons living with dementia who appear lost and disoriented, by providing them support and helping them to reunite with their families or caregivers. There are over 800 GTPs islandwide today. To enable quicker community responses in locating lost persons living with dementia, the public may use Dementia Singapores CARA app, which alerts users to missing persons in their vicinity. AIC continues to strengthen public awareness so that seniors, including persons living with dementia, can navigate public spaces safely. This includes expanding community training, providing useful resources for caregivers and guidance for the public on assisting seniors who appear lost or disoriented, and supporting partners in adopting clearer wayfinding signs in the community. Members of the public may visitwww.aic.sgto learn more about available dementia support and resources. They can also attend the interactive exhibition organised by AIC at Century Square, Tampines, from Feb 28 to March 6.

I am all for our students getting tasty and nutritious meals. The students at HCI also deserve to get what they have paid for and requested. But we must also recognise that SATS is a renowned caterer for Singapore Airlines and many of the airlines that call at Changi Airport, and other institutions here. It takes all feedback about its food and other services seriously, and makes changes where theyre due. Its early days yet for the bento meals at HCI, and expectations so far have not matched the reality on the ground. Instead of launching brickbats right away, a better approach may have been to ask, How can we make these meals better? That would turn the keyboard warriors into responsible stakeholders who are united in the common goal of seeing our students have quick access to healthy, reasonably priced and well-cooked meals. Lets give the bento meals a chance to evolve and catch on as SATS works through the feedback.

Forum: What long-term housing options are there for adults with autism?,"Jan 14, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 14, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Autism', 'Public housing']","My son was born in 1998 and is on the autism spectrum. He has very limited speech and cannot be left alone, but physically he is able to manage some activities of daily living with supervision. Like many adults with autism, he does not require institutional care, yet he cannot live fully independently without structure, familiarity and timely support. While Singapore promotes ageing-in-place and an inclusive society, living in a regular Housing Board environment can be challenging for adults with autism. My son has significant sensory sensitivities, particularly to high-pitched sounds such as baby cries. When exposed to such triggers, he becomes distressed and has difficulty regulating his behaviour. Out of consideration for our neighbours, we keep our doors and windows closed and limit his activities within the flat. As a result, he spends most of his time indoors, socially isolated– not because he chooses to be, but because the environment is not suited to his needs. Many families in similar situations try hard to be responsible neighbours, yet standard housing environments are often not designed with neurodiversity in mind. As parents age, the question of long-term housing becomes increasingly urgent. Under current HDB rules, a single person may buy a flat only from age 35. For those with autism, this timeline may be too late. Adapting to a new environment often requires many years of gradual exposure, training and familiarisation. A sudden transition later in life can be distressing and difficult to sustain. One possible way forward would be to explore a housing model for adults with special needs similar in concept to the Community Care Apartments for seniors. Such housing could consist of small, purpose-built apartments purchased by families, with access to support and environments designed to reduce sensory overload. This would not only support independent living, but also help build a more inclusive society where adults with special needs can live with dignity, safety and community acceptance.

Playing the one-point, winner-takes-all first round against 24-year-old Australian Petar Jovic, Chou did not manage to get a hit of the ball at the famed Rod Laver Arena when his opponent hit an ace to the singers right. One point is all it takes in the One Point Slam, an exhibition tournament that has tennis amateurs and pros facing off, meaning Chou did not get to show off the fruit of his labour from practising with 20-time grand slam champion Roger Federer in Shanghai. Chou sportingly applauded and congratulated Jovic for his winning serve, before throwing into the crowd the shades he wore on the court, much to the delight of the two women who were able to collect the spoils of his defeat. His pre-tournament comments proved prescient. Its a one-point game, so I could be knocked out without even touching the ball, the Taiwanese star, 46,had said whenherevealed he would be participating. He had also asked fans not to travel to Melbourne for the competition, where matches could last less than a minute. Chou, a singer-songwriter more frequently seen behind a piano, is also an accomplished tennis player who often posts videos of himself hitting long rallies on court. He reportedly took up the sport to play with his son Romeo, a budding tennis player at the age of seven. He had earlier stolen the spotlight from many of the other tennis pros like top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz and Australian Open defending champion Jannik Sinner before the match, with his fans carrying posters into the arena to encourage him. His opponent Jovic quipped that Chous the most famous guy in the stadium.

Artist Lawrence Lek sends self-driving cars to therapy with Guanyin in new exhibition,"Jan 14, 2026, 03:35 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 06:03 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a45e3aa6adb8357684a69245dfb15ab954894f7bd156ca26613b49ceaf48a588,London-based artist Lawrence Leks exhibition NOX: Confessions Of A Machine is on at the ArtScience Museum from Jan 23 to April 19.ST PHOTO: JASON QUAH,"['Singapore Art Week', 'Visual arts', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'Marina Bay Sands', 'ArtScience Museum']","SINGAPORE – London-based artist Lawrence Leks upcoming exhibition conjures a rehabilitation centre – not for deviant humans, but for sentient self-driving vehicles which burn out and are sent for therapy with the mental health chatbot Guanyin, named after the goddess of mercy. This might sound like hardcore science fiction, but the 43-year-old thinks his world resembles the corporate logic of well-being today. Just like some companies have perks for their employees – massages at work, team-building activities to make people enjoy work more – what if you had a case where you had a super-intelligent self-driving car you forced to work 24/7 and the company created a mental health app for the car? NOX: Confessions Of A Machine – to be held at the ArtScience Museum from Jan 23 to April 19 as part of Singapore Art Week – invites visitors to step into the rehabilitation centre in a work that blends role-playing video game, music and architecture. Lek, who flew in to Singapore from London, spoke to The Straits Times at the museum ahead of the exhibitions installation and opening. Named in 2024 by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in artificial intelligence (AI), Lek is at the forefront of fleshing out speculative narratives about automations effects. The premise of NOX is especially timely asSingapore started trialling driverless shuttle services in Punggol on Jan 12, with plans to deploy between 100 and 150 self-driving vehicles by end-2026. In 2019, Lek staged a work titled 2065 at the Singapore Biennale, imagining a post-work society where people spend all their leisure time playing video games. That same year, he released a feature-length sci-fi musical AIDOL, about a fading idol who enlists an AI songwriter to mount a comeback. Both read as prescient today in the age of doomscrolling and new AI tools. Leks work, which premiered at the LAS Art Foundation in Berlin in 2023, has since travelled the world and makes its South-east Asian premiere in Singapore. He says: In each of these places where the project is shown, the car means a very different thing. In Germany, the car is a cultural object that has a relation to a local industry, population and society. In some places like Singapore, a car is a super high-end luxury item. In Los Angeles, a car is a complete necessity to function in society. But it is the first time that NOX and Guanyin (Confessions Of A Former Chatbot) are being shown together, and Lek hopes this will create multiple entry points for audiences to experience the perspectives of both the caregiver and the sentient car. The work is presented in collaboration with Farsight Corporation. This is a fictional Anglo-Chinese technology conglomerate Lek invented in 2017 which he has since legally registered as a real company. It is part of his work as a method artist which has informed how he thinks of the company as a non-human entity with certain rights and liabilities. Of course, Singapore being founded by a company is also an interesting thing, notes the artist, who was born to Malaysian-Chinese parents and spent his childhood in several Asian cities, including Singapore. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles, representing the British East India Company, established Singapore as a British trading post. Lek believes that art can be instructive for tech companies. When I realised that big, well-funded companies take video games very seriously, I thought, what if they took fine art very seriously as a field of human work worth studying? After NOX, Lek – who sees his work as part of an expanding cinematic universe – wants to venture further into the future. His next series, which he is calling Death Drive, gets even more existential than psychotherapy for automobiles. The idea of a fixed life and identity is really strange. If youre a self-driving car, what sense of mortality would there be?

Just two weeks after Art SG 2025, she was back on the road. Among her first excursions was to Shanghai to see the inaugural staging of the Wan Hai Hotel – an itinerant art experience by Rockbund Art Museum that she invited to Singapore as part of Art SG 2026. Then, in Hampi, she huddled with Singapore artist Robert Zhao in the Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary as bears licked ghee and honey around her. The India trip cemented partnerships with institutions there for a new platform highlighting South Asian art, sponsored by automotive manufacturer TVS Motor. Zhao is presenting some of his works at art non-profit organisation The Institutums booth at the fair. Ms Yang tells The Straits Times: Because we are a hub, we touch so many regions. We connect with South Asia, on to East Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the broader Asia-Pacific. The art fair cant be an island, so we need to form these meaningful connections. Over 100 galleries from more than 30 countries and territories have signed up for the fourth edition at Marina Bay Sands – a comparable number with the past two editions. The anchor event of Singapore Art Week (SAW) runs from Jan 22 to 25, and is presented by multinational investment bank UBS. The 2026 edition boasts a slew of new initiatives that hopes to differentiate Art SG in an increasingly crowded Asian art fair landscape. Wan Hai Hotel: Singapore Strait will draw visitors into a world of video programmes, installations and performances at The Warehouse Hotel, and the TVS initiative is a three-year project that includes a keynote lecture and a South Asian exhibition space in Art SG. But the biggest change is the collapsing of S.E.A. Focus into Art SG,which made headlines in September. For seven editions, S.E.A. Focus was a separate exhibition of South-east Asian artists, which moved from Gillman Barracks to Tanjong Pagar Distripark, run by print and paper gallery and workshop STPI. The National Arts Council announced it would be taken over by Art SG to help grow South-east Asian art on a global scale, though it will retain its distinctive brand. Ms Yang, who advocated for this inclusion, says: S.E.A. Focus has been an amazing and meaningful platform, and it is at that point in time when it should be scaled up to reach broader audiences. Against fears that this could dilute S.E.A. Focus uniqueness, Ms Yang believes the re-invention will benefit both platforms. Now that they are under one roof, we can share audiences with single-ticket access. Were able to present a more complete narrative of South-east Asia. We want all the collectors to circulate through and then make the assessment on whats the most interesting and relevant for their own collections. Ms Yangs work to grow Art SG in the shadow of the pandemic culminates in an exciting guest list in 2026. These include the influential Tate patrons group, which supports Britains Tate galleries. The French Embassy is flying in curators from Paris Palais de Tokyo and arts centre LUMA Arles, while Shanghais Rockbund Art Museum brings a coterie of its own patrons. The director of Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Mr Michael Govan, is visiting Singapore to kick-start the museums acquisition for a permanent South-east Asia collection. Hong Kong non-profit Para Site, one of Asias most active independent art spaces, is hosting its first patrons event at the Wan Hai Hotel project. The project takes its name from a motel in Penang and evokes the borderless global networks of Chinatowns. More than 20 artists have been invited to show work related to oceans, rivers and migration, including Singapore artist Ming Wongs Bloody Marys Bar at the hotel bar and Malaysian artist Hoo Fan Chons fish station. These can be experienced in the hotels reception area, restaurant, bar and corridors over 10 days from morning to midnight and are open to non-hotel guests. Rockbund Art Museums executive director X Zhu-Nowell, who conceptualised the project, says: When we turned to Singapore, it became clear that it needed a different vocabulary. The Singapore Strait is not just a passage, it is also a dense zone shaped by shipping, finance, labour migration, surveillance and extraction. Singapore Art Week moves at a fast and overwhelming pace that can sometimes feel almost transactional. Wan Hai Hotel offers a different rhythm. The project deliberately creates conditions for slower encounters. Mr John Tung remains curator for S.E.A. Focus and has assembled 16 participating galleries under the theme of The Humane Agency. He promises that the platforms curatorial rigour has not been diminished with the move to Marina Bay Sands. Visitors can look forward to new works but also pieces already significant in South-east Asian art history. Titanic figures like Indonesian artist Arahmaiani and the Philippines Imelda Cajipe-Endaya are balanced with younger names like Filipino artist Nicole Coson. Singapore artist Tang Da Wus prerequisite for being included was that he had to be shown together with younger artists. I didnt need to be blackmailed, Mr Tung, who says his curation has been incredibly price-blind, jokes. The common refrain Ive heard is that S.E.A. Focus is a barometer of practices in the region, and you cannot be a good barometer if your sample size is exceedingly skewed. Referencing Americas capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro on Jan 3, he says: 2025 was a traumatic year on a global level and 2026 is off to an even worse start. I wanted to put out there something that could be a beacon of light that not only recognises the situation we are in, but also gives focus as to what we could do to make it better. Artists are essentially trying to communicate a more noble path forward. Ms Yang has worked to add a third art cluster in the River Valley area in addition to Tanjong Pagar Distripark and Gillman Barracks. There will be a map, with dining options marked out, helping visitors navigate the area that contains the Wan Hai Hotel project, STPIs inaugural The Print Show & Symposium, Tanoto Art Foundations first exhibition at New Bahru, Kim Associations presentation of Chinese artist Shuang Li, Singapore artist Dawn Ngs solo at the Singapore Repertory Theatre black box and JW Projects show of Shanghai artist Ge Hui. The cherry on top for Art SG 2026 is a new US$10,000 (S$12,900) Art SG Futures Prize presented by UBS to an outstanding emerging artist featured in the fairs young galleries section. Ms Yang says her work has been helped by exciting developments in South-east Asia, which add to Singapores allure as the regions gateway. Many international visitors are taking the chance to fly on to the ongoing Thailand Biennale in Phuket or the much-hyped private museum Dib Bangkok that opened in late 2025.

Worlds most influential artist Ibrahim Mahama holds solo show at Singapore Art Week,"Jan 14, 2026, 03:35 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 06:19 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/4f976a3ad2c28a56ee43081e1a069f509e2de2c56750677e1bcf7152f798745b,Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama topped ArtReview magazines annual power list in 2025.PHOTO: COURTESY OF IBRAHIM MAHAMA,"['Singapore Art Week', 'Visual arts', 'Exhibitions']","SINGAPORE – The worlds most influential figure in the art world, Ibrahim Mahama, is sitting on the floor of his studio in his home town of Tamale, Ghana. He harbours no airs, and maybe even looks a little sleepy as he chats with The Straits Times over Zoom. To anyone who asks about his topping of ArtReview magazines annual power list in 2025, his go-to reply has been that it was humbling. Gesturing to his surroundings, he says: Where I live is a village. Were surrounded by farms and children whose parents can barely pay for them to go to school. Ibrahim calls such external validation part of the paradox of the art world where, to make the kind of socially conscious, community-oriented work he is known for, he has had to hold shows in the Western Hemisphere to generate capital. Now that Ive been named No. 1, people have to pay me my money, he jokes. One of the first events Ibrahim is attending after receiving his accolade in December is Singapore Art Week, which kicks off on Jan 22. Under the auspices of non-profit Art Outreach and The Pierre Lorinet Collection, he has made new works for a solo show titled Digging Stars, on at Gillman Barracks from Jan 16 to Feb 8. The 39-year-old will also conduct a performance lecture at Art Outreachs symposium on Jan 24 at Marina Bay Sands. This will be centred on his obsession with excavating materials and making meaning of their residues. He says: Its not a difficult thing at all, but it requires effort. It doesnt make any sense to do it every day, but we artists constantly dwell in the realm of stupidity and senselessness. Its not like medicine, where it can save a human body. Art starts from failure, but somehow the body is renewed in a way that it becomes a lot more sensitive to the world. Though Ibrahim confesses he has not had much contact with South-east Asia, the material that made his name – the jute fibre sack – is largely manufactured in the region. He first used it to engulf a corridor artery at the Venice Biennale in 2015 and his ambitions have only expanded. Since then, he and his collaborators have stitched tens of thousands of fragments of the coarse and tattered material into giant structures enveloping buildings, monuments and gallery spaces like the National Theatre of Ghana and the Porta Venezia, or Venice Gate, in Milan, Italy. Recalling his undergraduate years, Ibrahim cites a professor who drew comparisons between Ghana and Singapore and Malaysia as aspiring nations of a class gaining independence in the 1950s and 1960s. That is a now forgotten history. Ghana was sending engineers to Singapore and Malaysia, and certain intellectuals from there came to Ghana, he says. It was all about expanding our economic capabilities and reinforcing our sovereignty. Theres a sharp contrast now in terms of how developed Singapore is. When he first paid attention to the ubiquitous jute sacks transporting vegetables, cocoa and rice while visiting a friend in Burkina Faso in 2011, it was not the bags enmeshing in systems of labour and production but their aesthetics that first enticed him. I was very curious about the forms they took, he says. I started collecting specifically the ones that charcoal centres used – with the scars, the patina and the dark stains. I realised there was something that the material did when you laid it against a building. Meaning came after and easily. The scale of his projects meant he needed collaborators, and who better than the women most familiar with them in Ghanian markets? He also got audiences to sew the material, like in Syntagma Square in Athens, Greece, in 2017, inverting global systems of extraction. The same idea can take on severely different meanings depending on time and place, in the way the works of fellow wrappers Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whom he is frequently compared with, might not. He says of his project in Milans Porta Venezia: Those two towers were the gates into the city of Milan back in the mediaeval period, and you paid your taxes when you entered. 2019 was during the height of the refugee crisis, and a lot of people didnt want to accept them. But the material speaks of global transactions, the commodities we consume and the relationships those create. The bag doesnt forget and records what humanity neglects. There are unexpected parallels between his new works for Singapore and South-east Asias history. There will still be some jute, but he has also explored rubber residues taken from Ghanas defunct factories, which were built during the countrys drive for self-reliance in the 1960s but later neglected. Pressures under colonialism made Malaysia and Singapore the major rubber exporters in the 20th century, at one point producing half the worlds supply. A lot of the works are quite beautiful, he promises of his Brutalist creations. Ibrahim frowns at the idea of artists from the Global South moving to Western metropoles after gaining global recognition. In Tamale, he has plugged his earnings into building cultural centres such as the Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art, the Red Clay Studio and Nkrumah Volini, attracting ordinary families, sometimes from faraway villages. Twenty kids pack themselves onto a single tricycle, precariously wobbling to see the fantasy ground where they will get their first exposure to art. We produce cocoa in Ghana, but a lot of farmers have never eaten chocolate, he says. We cannot forget what art represents. Art has always been about the quest for new freedoms. Im making work in museums all around the world, but everything I have intellectually and materially came from here. What about these peoples encounter with the work, not just at the point of making?

The case involves two boys who were appearing on a television drama that he was producing in New Mexico. Busfield, 68, went to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Albuquerque and will be booked on a warrant that was signed Friday by a Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court judge in Albuquerque. The warrant said that Busfield had been charged with two counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and one count of child abuse. Stanton Stein, a civil lawyer for Busfield, said his client had voluntarily appeared before the New Mexico authorities after travelling across the country to confront these false and deeply troubling allegations. He is innocent and is determined to clear his name, Stein said in a statement. Gilbert Gallegos, a spokesperson for the Albuquerque Police Department, said earlier Jan 13 that the department was working with federal marshals to take Busfield into custody because he was not in New Mexico. A police affidavit said the offences took place in 2022. At that time, Busfield was an executive producer and actor on the crime drama The Cleaning Lady (2022 to 2025). The police began investigating him in 2025 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital, where staff members requested a sexual-abuse investigation and said it appeared the boys were being groomed, the affidavit said. Stein said that after the womans son was terminated from the show, she had vowed to seek revenge against Busfield. What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing, Stein said. Warner Bros. Television, which produced the show, said in a statement Tuesday that the health safety of its cast and crew was always its top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have processes in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action, the company said. We are aware of the current charges against Mr Busfield and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement in a timely manner. Busfield won an Emmy Award for best supporting actor in a drama series for his work in ABCs Thirtysomething, which aired for four years beginning in 1987. He also portrayed a journalist on political drama The West Wing (1999 to 2006). He is married to American actress Melissa Gilbert. The affidavit said Busfield would invite the boys family to gatherings off the set, with his wife buying Christmas gifts to foster closeness. Gilberts publicist said in a statement that Gilbert was honouring a request from her husbands lawyers not to speak publicly about the case while it unfolds. During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment, the statement said. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.

MPA offers more LNG bunkering licences to address growing demand for cleaner marine fuels,"Jan 14, 2026, 02:50 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:14 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/36e4869398d41a4c5c5237ad667590e74a8b0048439f8da07afd9dfe660d3d77,Industry experts say that demand for LNG bunkering has grown significantly over the past few years.ST PHOTO: BRIAN TEO,"['Oil and gas sector', 'Fossil fuels', 'Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore', 'Maritime and shipping', 'Environmental issues']","SINGAPORE -The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) is offering permits to existing and new applicants to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel in the Port of Singapore. Firms that obtain the licence will be required to implement end-to-end LNG bunkering supply arrangements, MPA said on Jan 14. These arrangements will include securing LNG supply, demand planning, cargo transfer operations, storage and safe handling of LNG, as well as the sale, supply and delivery of LNG fuel to vessels in Singapore – one of the worlds largest bunkering ports. Industry experts say demand for LNG bunkering has grown significantly over the past few years. The demand is driven not only by regulatory mandates – on reductions in greenhouse gas intensity for fuels used in shipping – but also by the growth of the LNG dual-fuel fleet, which consists of ships designed to run on both LNG and conventional marine fuels. According to Norwegian classification society and risk consultant DNVs Alternative Fuels Insight platform, 642 LNG-powered vessels were in operation in 2025 worldwide. Of these, 169 were delivered in 2024, the highest delivery of such vessels ever. The growth in demand is expected to continue, with 264 new orders for LNG-fuelled vessels placed in 2024 – also a record and more than double the number of orders placed in 2023. Experts believe the total addressable market for LNG pathway fuels – which include LNG, bio-LNG and e-methane – will grow exponentially by the end of this decade. The LNG pathway fuels use LNGs established infrastructure to fuel ships, and they are increasingly recognised as a practical route to take the shipping industry to net-zero emissions. Singapores call for additional applications follows the recent updates to the Singapore LNG bunkering licensing framework and standards. They now include the provision of sea-based LNG reloading and the supply of liquefied bio-methane and e-methane in the Port of Singapore, the port regulator said. MPA on Jan 14 said the licensees are now required to own or charter at least one LNG bunker vessel (LBV) for the entire licence period. The LBV must be registered with the Singapore Registry of Ships and comply with MPAs Standards for Port Limit LNG Bunker Vessels, it said. To support international shippings decarbonisation efforts, applicants are also required to submit a proposal detailing their technical readiness to supply LNG fuels with lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, such as liquefied bio-methane and e-methane. The proposal should also cover intended supply pathways and sourcing arrangements. Applicants for the new licences are also required to outline measures to monitor and mitigate methane slip – which refers to the leakage of methane fuel – from LNG bunker vessels. The outline of measures should include vessel design features, operational practices, and monitoring or reporting approaches. The measures will be assessed as part of the licence evaluation process, said MPA. In July 2025, MPA conducted a large-scale chemical spill drill simulating a methanol leak, ahead of issuance of the first batch of methanol bunkering licences in November to Global Energy Trading, Golden Island, and PetroChina International (Singapore). The regulator on Jan 14 said that to further enhance Singapores LNG bunkering ecosystem, MPA and Enterprise Singapore, through the Singapore Standards Council, will upgrade the existing Technical Reference for LNG Bunkering (TR56) to a Singapore Standard (SS) in the second quarter of 2026. The new SS will update and strengthen the requirements under TR56, aligning them with Singapores broader bunkering standards and serving as a key reference for LNG bunkering licence applicants. MPA has also published the Standards for Port Limit LNG Bunker Vessels, developed in consultation with the industry, to ensure the safe operation of LNG bunker vessels in Singapore. These standards specify requirements for equipment, operational performance and efficiency of LNG bunker vessels. Singapores LNG ecosystem has developed fast since the opening of its first terminal in 2013 – making LNG the top fuel for power generation. The first Request for Proposal for LNG bunkering was launched in July 2015. In the same year, MPA announced a co-funding scheme to support the building of LNG-fuelled vessels. In May 2021, FueLNG – a joint venture between Keppel and Shell Eastern Petroleum – completed Singapores first bunkering of an LNG-fuelled oil tanker. Shell has become one of the biggest players in LNG trading and bunkering in Singapore after it completed the acquisition of Pavilion Energy from Temasek in April 2025.

The Catalist-listed mining stock rose as much as 5.9 per cent to $1.25 in morning trade on Jan 14, and was up 3.4 per cent at $1.22 at 1.40pm. About eight million shares had changed hands. The counter closed 5.1 per cent higher at $1.24 on Jan 14. Spot gold, meanwhile, rose 1.1 per cent to a new record high of US$4,639.42 an ounce on Jan 14. The precious metal has surged more than 60 per cent over the past year amid heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, including the Russia-Ukraine war, conflict in Gaza, and policy uncertainty stemming from US President Donald Trumps tariffs. The latest spikes have been driven by Mr Trumps capture of Venezuelas leader, his renewed threats to annex Greenland, and violent protests in Iran that could lead to a toppling of the Islamic regime there. Other precious metals have also rallied. Silver broke above US$90 an ounce for the first time on Jan 14, while platinum and palladium both jumped more than 4 per cent. CNMC Goldmine in August posted record earnings of US$15.8 million (S$20.4 million) for the first half of the 2025 financial year, a 256.1 per cent jump from a year earlier. Revenue for the six months ended June 2025 surged 78 per cent to US$52.8 million, driven by higher gold production and stronger selling prices. In comparison, the group earned US$9.8 million for the whole of the 2024 financial year. Its previous earnings record was US$12.2 million in the 2014 financial year. Mr Zavier Wong, market analyst at trading platform eToro, said CNMC Goldmine Holdings share price strength appears to be tied to a broader shift in global sentiment towards gold. Gold has been well bid for months, but the latest bout of geopolitical uncertainty and persistent rate ambiguity has sharpened investor focus on the metal again... For a small, pure-play producer like CNMC, that tends to feed through quickly into their share price, given how tightly it tracks movements in gold, he said. CNMCs earlier record earnings have definitely helped anchor confidence that higher gold prices can translate into real cash flow for them – if geopolitical risks remain sticky and central bank demand stays firm, golds support looks intact, and companies like CNMC are likely to remain on investors radar. Ms Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, noted that golds ongoing strength, underpinned by safe-haven demand and positive flows into precious metals, continues to support mining stocks. She added that CNMCs expanded processing capacity at its Sokor operation in Kelantan, Malaysia, remains a key growth driver. Ms Sachdeva also noted that CNMCs share register is relatively retail-heavy, with individual investors and insiders collectively holding the majority stake, while institutional presence remains limited. This can contribute to heightened price volatility, a common feature in smaller, sector-specific stocks, but does not, in itself, indicate fundamental weakness, she said. In short, while the near-term surge is largely sentiment-driven by the bullion rally, CNMCs earnings trajectory and asset expansion lend credibility to the uptrend, even as the stock remains a small-cap play rather than a large institutional favourite.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/cnmc-goldmine-shares-shine-amid-soaring-gold-prices
Saks Global files for bankruptcy after Neiman Marcus takeover leads to financial collapse,"Jan 14, 2026, 01:21 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 07:22 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d0c44b13790521f2cefd695c3b61415c247f380f0d32b1d71652b1e9fc8c4269,"The move cast uncertainty over the future of US luxury fashion, though Saks said its stores would remain open for now after it finalised a $2.3 billion financing package.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Retail', 'Bankruptcy/Liquidation', 'United States']","NEW YORK-High-end department store conglomerate Saks Global has filed for bankruptcy protection in one of the largest retail collapses since the Covid-19 pandemic. It comes barely a year after a deal that brought Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus under the same roof. The move cast uncertainty over the future of US luxury fashion, though the retailer said early on Jan 14 that its stores would remain open for now after it finalised a US$1.75 billion (S$2.3 billion) financing package and appointed a new chief executive officer. Former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck will replace Mr Richard Baker, who was the architect of the acquisition strategy that left Saks Global saddled with debt. Saks Fifth Avenue, the retail arm of Saks Global, listed US$1 billion to US$10 billion in assets and liabilities, according to court documents. The court process is meant to give the luxury retailer room to negotiate a debt restructuring with creditors or sell itself to a new owner to stave off liquidation. Failing that, the company may be forced to shutter. A retailer long loved by the rich and famous, from Gary Cooper to Grace Kelly, Saks fell on hard times after the pandemic, as competition from online outlets rose, and brands started selling items through their own storesmore frequently. The new financing deal would provide an immediate cash infusion of US$1 billion through a debtor-in-possession loan from an investor group, Saks Global said. Reuters earlier reported the loan was led by Pentwater Capital Management in Naples, Florida, and Boston-based Bracebridge Capital. Financing worth US$240 million would be available through an asset-backed loan provided by the companys asset-based lenders, according to Saks Global. The luxury retailer will have access to US$500 million of financing from the investor group once it successfully exits bankruptcy protection, expected later in 2026, the company added. A host of luxury brands were among the unsecured creditors, led by Chanel and Gucci owner Kering at about US$136 million and US$60 million, respectively, the court filing said. The worlds biggest luxury conglomerate, LVMH, was listed as an unsecured creditor at US$26 million. In total, Saks Global estimated that there were between 10,001 and 25,000 creditors. In 2024, Mr Baker had masterminded the takeover of Neiman Marcus by Canadas Hudsons Bay, which had owned Saks since 2013, and later spun off the US luxury assets to create Saks Global, bringing together three names that have defined American high fashion for over a century.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/saks-global-files-for-bankruptcy-after-neiman-marcus-takeover-leads-to-financial-collapse

Monthly registrations of electric vehicles, including battery electric and plug-in hybrids, dropped further in North America after the end in October of an EV tax credit scheme in the US, consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) said. Radical policy shifts, includingUS President Donald Trumps U-turn on electrificationand a relaxation of emission standards in the European Union, shook the global EV market in 2025 into a virtually unrecognisable landscape, according to BMI data manager Charles Lester. Rising competition in Europe and cooling demand in China are likely to intensify the debate between electrification proponents who emphasise the need to curb planet-warming CO2 emissions, and carmakers who say a quick transition threatens jobs and profits. Global EV registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 6 per cent to almost 2.1 million units in December, reaching 20.7 million vehicles in 2025, the data showed. They were up 2 per cent in China to more than 1.3 million, the lowest year-on-year increase since February 2024, leading to a 17 per cent increase to 12.9 million units in 2025. The country produced 71 per cent of EVs sold worldwide. North American registrations fell 39 per cent in December to just over 100,000 cars sold, following similar declines in October and November at the end of US tax credits. They were down 4 per cent for whole of 2025. Europe was up 34 per cent in December to over 450,000 registrations and 33 per cent for 2025, while in the rest of the world sales were up 41 per cent to over 160,000 units in December, and 48 per cent for the year. BMI expects 23.9 million EVs will be sold globally in 2026, a 15.7 per cent increase, with growth sharply accelerating in China to 21 per cent and slowing in Europe and the rest of the world to 15 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively. It forecasts a sharper drop of 23 per cent in North America due to a 29 per cent slump in the US.

Cordlife first received a six-month suspension in November 2023 after audit checks found lapses in its storage of cord blood units. It has not been allowed to collect, test, process and store new cord blood since November 2025. However, this licence renewal will allow Cordlife to continue to store and transfer the cord blood still under its care. It also had its human tissue banking licence renewed for two years, until January 2028. Cordlife shares jumped from an opening price of 12.7 cents to 15 cents at 11.40am on Jan 14, as the market reacted to the announcement filed on the Singapore Exchange. The counter closed 3.2 cents higher at 15.9 cents on Jan 14. Cordlifes group executive director Shally Chen said: We are committed to complying with all conditions attached to the licences, and to eventually restore the confidence of all stakeholders in the way we conduct our services. Ms Chen, who is also group chief executive and CEO for Singapore, said the conditions do not apply to its businesses in its five other markets in the region. In a separate filing, Cordlife said it has applied to convert ongoing client claims into an originating claim. This typically happens when the material facts of a civil claim are in dispute. If granted, it could move the dispute to a full trial process. Claims totalling at least $5.45 million had been made by parents who stored 109 cord blood units with Cordlife. It previously said the claimants had sought damages at a market value of $50,000 for each damaged unit, or any other amount determined by the court, and the reimbursement of expenses related to the damage. The claimants now have to file an affidavit by Feb 3. Cordlife noted that if it is ordered to pay the claims in this financial year, there would be a negative impact on its financial position. It also said some 60 per cent of affected customers had accepted refunds and an enhanced package from the company, which offers benefits such as five additional years of free storage.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/cordlife-shares-jump-18-after-renewal-of-restricted-licence
China ends 2025 with record $1.5 trillion trade surplus despite Trump tariffs,"Jan 14, 2026, 11:28 AM","Jan 14, 2026, 07:32 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/6bae86707cbb83ddff137131c3f43931231d62320c9afb493968b8ecd215836a,Chinese exporters successfully sought out customers in other markets when shipments to the US plunged on Trump tariffs.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['China', 'Trade', 'Tariffs', 'China economy']","BEIJING- China on Jan 14 reported a strong export run in 2025 with a record trillion-dollar surplus, as producers braced themselves for three more years of a Trump administration set on slowing the production powerhouse by shifting US orders to other markets. Beijings resilience to renewed tariff tensions since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January 2025 has emboldened Chinese firms to shift their focus to South-east Asia, Africa and Latin America to offset US duties. With Beijing looking to exports to counteract a prolonged property slump and sluggish domestic demand, the record-shattering surplus risks further unsettling economies concerned about Chinas trade practices and overcapacity, as well as their over-reliance on key Chinese products. The manufacturing powerhouses full-year trade surplus came in at US$1.19 trillion (S$1.5 trillion) – a figure on a par with the gross domestic product of a top 20 economy globally like Saudi Arabia – havingbroken the trillion-dollar ceiling for the first time in November. Outbound shipments grew 6.6 per cent in value terms year on year in December, compared with a 5.9 per cent increase in November. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 3 per cent increase. Imports were up 5.7 per cent, after a 1.9 per cent bump the month earlier, and beat a forecast of a 0.9 per cent uptick. Monthly export surpluses exceeded US$100 billion seven times in 2025, partially underpinned by a weakened yuan, up from just once in 2024, underscoring that Mr Trumps actions have barely dented Chinas trade with the wider world even if he has curbed US-bound shipments. Economists expect China to continue gaining global market share in 2026, helped by Chinese firms setting up overseas production hubs that provide lower-tariff access to the US and the European Union, as well as by strong demand for lower-grade chips and other electronics. A flagship of Beijings global industrial ambitions, Chinas auto industry saw overall exports jump 19.4 per cent to 5.79 million vehicles in 2025, with pure electric vehicle shipments up 48.8 per cent. China would likely remain the worlds top auto exporter for a third year after first superseding Japan in 2023. Beijing, however, has shown signs of recognising it must moderate its industrial exports if it is to sustain its success, and the leadership has been increasingly cognisant and vocal about imbalances in Chinas economy and the image problem outsized exports are causing. After Novembers trillion-dollar surplus data, Chinese Premier Li Qiang was quoted last week on national television as calling for proactively expanding imports and promoting the balanced development of imports and exports. The country also scrapped subsidy-like export tax rebates for its solar industry, a longstanding point of friction with EU states. Lawmakers in December passed revisions to the Foreign Trade Law after two, rather than the usual three, readings, in a signal to members of a major trans-Pacific trade pact that China is prepared to shift from industrial subsidies and towards freer, more open trade. Despite the year-long truce on tariffs that Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck in late October, US duties of 47.5 per cent on Chinese goods are well above the roughly 35 per cent level analysts say enables Chinese firms to export to the US at a profit.

Buyout billionaire Kim wins court fight over arrest bid,"Jan 14, 2026, 09:53 AM","Jan 14, 2026, 11:25 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/49f439b5eac0fcb0dba86865f1bdc568c30c5adae844f387204ba8c6c0c1c357,Prosecutors sought to take Mr Michael Kim ByungJu into custody as part of a probe into his firms management of the beleaguered supermarket chain Homeplus.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG,"['South Korea', 'Billionaires/Millionaires', 'Private equity']","SEOUL-Mr Michael Kim ByungJu won a key victory after a South Korean court rejected prosecutors request to detain the billionaire co-founder of buyout firm MBK Partners as part of a probe into the companys management of supermarket chain Homeplus, which entered court-led rehabilitation in 2025. South Korean prosecutors are investigating Mr Kim and three others on charges including fraud, examining how Homeplus slid from being the nations second-largest retailer into financial distress and eventual rehabilitation. The judge on Jan 14 rejected a request by prosecutors to arrest Mr Kim, 62, while they investigate MBK Partners handling of Homeplus, which was once one of the buyout firms biggest and most ambitious investments in South Korea. The court told Bloomberg News via text message that all the requests for arrest warrants had been dismissed. While it is clear that the alleged harm in this case is very serious, the materials submitted to date are insufficient to establish the charges to a degree that would justify detention, the court said. The court also said that taking Mr Kim into custody could impact his ability to prepare his defence, saying it was necessary to allow the suspects sufficient opportunity to mount a defence while not in custody, rather than detaining the suspects due to concerns over destruction of evidence or flight. The ruling brings some relief for Mr Kim, who has faced mounting pressure as the probe intensified, including a travel ban imposed in 2025. MBK Partners has strenuously denied wrongdoing. The investigation has piled pressure on one of Asias most prominent private equity firms. It also heralded a new phase in South Korean authorities bid to better regulate the countrys private equity sector, amid mounting calls for tighter scrutiny after a series of high-profile missteps by top players, some of which have enraged local consumers. Prosecutors have been probing whether Homeplus and MBK Partners knew the retailer was heading toward a credit downgrade when 82 billion won (S$71.6 million) of bonds backed by assets linked to Homeplus were issued in February 2025. A significant portion of these short-term notes were bought by retail investors. But soon after the issuance, a local ratings firm downgraded the supermarket chain. And days after that, the company filed for court receivership. Distraught buyers have staged public protests, demanding accountability and compensation. The dispute has tarnished the otherwise gilded career of the Korean-born, US-educated financier who ventured into private equity and became one of the richest people in South Korea. After starting in investment banking, he rose to an executive director position at Goldman Sachs before becoming the Carlyle Groups top dealmaker in the region. He helped start his eponymous firm in 2005 and has built it up to become one of Asias largest home-grown private equity companies. Over two decades, the Seoul-based fund focused on North Asia expanded to amass over US$30 billion (S$38.7 billion) in capital under management, with offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo. Mr Kims net worth is estimated at about US$9.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/buyout-billionaire-kim-wins-court-fight-over-arrest-bid
Singapore farmers head across the border to Johor for cheaper land and energy,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:39 AM","Jan 14, 2026, 08:53 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/70a56fcdfda17e49ae5e0b194fcabbae031bea950d3aca67e9e567ed36fb07e8,"Mr Vincent Wei is securing farmers for a 80.9ha site in the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, a joint venture between his agri-tech firm Archisen and Malaysias Southern Catalyst.PHOTO: ARCHISEN","['Singapore', 'Johor', 'Agriculture/farming']","SINGAPORE - Mr Vincent Wei led fellow Singaporean farmers around an empty Malaysian plot, laying out plans for a greenhouse and rows of leafy vegetables. What he pitched was not just space for crops but a lifeline for growers struggling to make ends meet amid high prices and little vacant land. The to-be agriculture hub is part of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) launched in 2025. It is expected to cost US$123 million (S$158.5 million) and produce 10,000 tonnes of fresh produce a year. It is luring Singapores farmers with promises of cheaper land, labour and energy just over the border. Mr Wei is confident of securing farmers for the 80.9ha site, promising they can reduce their cost of set-up and operations there. Representing a joint venture between his agri-tech firm Archisen and Southern Catalyst, backed by Malaysias Ministry of Finance, he aims to get them going by the third quarter of 2026, offering 25-year land leases bundled with infrastructure and electricity. Its an aggressive timeline, Mr Wei admitted, as earth diggers roamed the plot clearing it of palm trees. But wait any longer and some of those ventures may already be out of business, he said. Singapore has tried in recent years to reinvigorate its farming industry. Last week, itopened the worlds tallest vertical farm, valued at $80 million and set to produce up to 2,000 tonnes of vegetables such as lettuce and spinach a year. Yet, a string of farm and start-up closures has underlined how high-tech agriculture is far from being a definitive solution for the island states food security. The fledgling sector has been buffeted by headwinds – supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures on energy and manpower costs, and a tougher financing environment, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in November. That has forced the Government to scale back an ambitious plan to meet a third of its populations nutritional needs through local production by the end of this decade. Still keen to protect against disruptions like those seen during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, the countrys new target is to meet 20 per cent of fibre and 30 per cent of protein needs locally by 2035. While Singapore has poured more than $300 million into agri-tech research and development, some farmers complain that does little to ease the cost pressures of actually running a farm. Ms Grace Lim, co-founder of a vertical farm GroGrace, has been losing about $25,000 a month since her electricity bill doubled between 2019 and 2025. She called for the Government to subsidise the sector, like in the European Union, which is expanding payments and simplifying financing for farmers. Why are they letting perfectly working commercial farms die while they continue to pour money into research that doesnt actually grow your real food? she said. The mounting losses have also frightened off investors. Private funding for agriculture ventures in Singapore peaked at $1.1 billion in 2021 but had dwindled to just a tenth of that by 2025, according to venture capital firm AgFunder. Mr Wei believes the industry is in a fund-raising winter, where start-ups are hard-pressed to find investors because they are unable to turn a profit. Enter the JS-SEZ where Mr Wei, his clients, and other firms are starting to shift or expand their operations. Singapore-based Vegeponics, for instance, is expanding its container and vertical farms to the JS-SEZ. By having facilities in both countries, the vegetable grower expects to cut operational costs – which can reach $70,000 a month – by about a third, said marketing manager Jesper Fan. The move will also be welcome for retailers and customers seeking price and supply stability. Mr Wei said the agriculture hub in the JS-SEZ could support closer cross-border cooperation and strengthen regional food resilience in South-east Asia and further afield as Japanese, Korean and Chinese farmers also show interest. For Mr Wei, what began as investor pitches and site walks around overgrown fields is gradually giving way to discussions on farm layouts and investment timelines. I think it is high time something like this is done, he said. If you dont work with your neighbour, who do you work with?

With a total purse of US$1 million (S$1.29 million), of which 60 per cent goes to the winner, the Listed one-turn turf mile event will be the most valuable thoroughbred race to be ever held in Abu Dhabi. The capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is host to one of the Middle-East countrys five race clubs under the umbrella of the Emirates Racing Authority, headed by its Dubai flagship in Meydan, and three other clubs in Al Ain, Jebel Ali and Sharjah. Entries are free and close on Feb 4, while travel and stabling costs for overseas runners will be undertaken by the Abu Dhabi Turf Club with owners, trainers and jockeys also hosted for the event, all expenses paid. The US$1 million Abu Dhabi Gold Cup will be the most valuable turf mile race to be staged in the Gulf region in 2026. The new race demonstrates the ambition and vision of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and the determination to take horse racing in Abu Dhabi to new levels, said Abu Dhabi Turf Cubs racing manager Ali Al Jaffal. The Abu Dhabi Turf Club has long been an integral part of the globally respected horse racing scene in the UAE and we look forward to attracting a truly international cast of participants to the inaugural Abu Dhabi Gold Cup, and to developing the race into one of the most prestigious turf mile contests in the world in the years to come. Taking a leaf from a current global trend in reciprocal link-ups between racing jurisdictions, the Abu Dhabi Gold Cup winner will gain an automatic berth to the US$1 million Grade 1 Old Forester Bourbon Turf Classic Stakes (1,800m) at Churchill Downs on Kentucky Derby Day, May 2. In 2025, Parchment Party earned a golden ticket to Australias Melbourne Cup by winning the Grade 3 Belmont Gold Cup in Saratoga in June. Over the past weekend, winners of three Group 1 races on Kings Plate day in Cape Town, South Africa, snapped up a Win and Youre In start to three corresponding races at the Breeders Cup World Championships at Keeneland, Kentucky in October. In an agreement between Abu Dhabi Turf Club and Churchill Downs Inc, entry fees will be waived for the Turf Classic, while the Abu Dhabi Turf Club will offer travel stipends to the winner. Churchill Downs Inc is fully committed to encouraging international participation in our extensive portfolio of Grade 1 races, and we are delighted to announce the new link-up between the Grade 1 Old Forester Bourbon Turf Classic and the inaugural Abu Dhabi Gold Cup, which is the most valuable mile race in the Gulf region, said its vice-president of racing Gary Palmisano. The Old Forester Bourbon Turf Classic is one of five Grade 1 races on Kentucky Derby Day, annually one of the most spectacular days of sport in America broadcast to tens of millions of people throughout the world, and the association with the Abu Dhabi Turf Club is a demonstration of our commitment to international racing at the highest level. The undercard on Abu Dhabi Gold Cup day will also feature competitive races for both thoroughbreds and purebred Arabians highlighted by the Group 1 Alanudd Classic (2,200m), Group 2 Liwa Oasis (1,400m) and the Listed Arabian Triple Crown (1,600m) for purebred Arabians, and the Listed Abu Dhabi Championship (2,400m) for thoroughbreds. One offshore racing personality who has already expressed interest in the Abu Dhabi marquee race is well-known Group 1-winning British trainer Charlie Hills. Congratulations must go to the Abu Dhabi Turf Club for creating this new US$1 million contest and we have already nominated our Group 1 winner Ciceros Gift for the race through the International Racing Bureau, said Hills to the UKs Racing TV. There are not many opportunities of this magnitude for top-class milers at this time of year and I can see the Abu Dhabi Gold Cup quickly establishing itself as an important race in the international calendar as well as the Abu Dhabi Turf Club becoming an increasingly powerful force in world racing. Ciceros Gift had mostly flown under the radar as a decent UK stakes winner until his 100-1 claim to fame in the Group 1 Qipco Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (1,600m) at Ascot on Oct 18. manyan@sph.com.sg",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/abu-dhabi-ready-to-shine-in-its-new-gold-cup-glory
Pacific Spirit gets into the mood at KL trials,"Jan 14, 2026, 09:48 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:48 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7b336a6117f63ff89dc49bd47b8f47d237fdb6335b105a8c1ec8986ff05b5c36,Pacific Spirit (Oscar Chavez) strolling away to a dominant nine-length win in Trial No. 5 at Sungai Besi on Jan 13.PHOTO: SELANGOR TURF CLUB,"['Horse racing', 'Malaysia', 'Sports and recreation']","Looking at it any which way, it was a good morning at the trials which were run off at the Selangor Turf Club on Jan 13. For one thing, the training spoils were rather evenly distributed. Nick Selvan took the honours when he claimed two of the six trials with Prince Lonhro in the second and Rhythm Of Zen in the last, while the other four other winners were saddled by four different trainers. The timings were not too shabby either. Two of the four, who trialled on grass, came close to breaking the minute-mark for the 1,000m trip. Still, the prize for outstanding performances of the morning had to be shared by two horses from the power-packed Pacific Stable. Speed demon Pacific Vampire took the prize for the swiftest gallop when he won the opener in 1min 0.74sec. In the fifth jump-out – which was on the sand track – Pacific Spirit proved to be the easiest winner of the day, beating Lims Puncak Jaya (Uzair Sharudin) by nine lengths. Needless to say, with plenty of daylight between the Rip Van Winkle five-year-old and the rest, jockey Oscar Chavez was in no hurry to push his mount home. The Panamanian allowed Pacific Spirit to cruise up in a relatively slow time of 1:03.23. But if push had come to shove, Chavez would have stepped on the accelerator and Pacific Spirit would have taken off. As it turned out, there was no need for dramatics. Pacific Spirit had done what he had to do. He had taken the lead after the runners had covered the initial 200m and he never gave it back. Even if the time did not say so, it was a really smart win by the David Kok-trained two-time winner. As for Pacific Vampire, he had the opening trial run on his terms. Another one ridden by Chavez, Pacific Vampire had hit the front after 400m and thereafter he had his rivals chasing his shadow. Then again, with his high rating of 100 points, anything less would have been unacceptable. Like that last race on Jan 3. Racegoers sent him off as the $9 top pick but he burnt a hole in their pockets when he finished last. Sure, he was obliged to race wide. But that was no excuse and the racing stewards agreed that he had to go for a 1,000m test gallop before his next start. As it turned out, Pacific Vampire passed that test with flying colours and when trainer Jason Ong sends the Impending six-year-old out for his next race, a ninth career win will be at stake. From that same trial, take note of runner-up, Omakase. He fashioned a nice run at the top of the straight and was putting in his best work late. Then again, one could say he lost no marks when going down to a talent like Pacific Vampire. Trained by Lim Shung You, this Universal Ruler five-year-old has yet to show up in a race. But when he does, he could – on his overseas record – give a good account of himself. Racing as Dialling in Western Australia, he won three races. He opened his account at Kalgoorlie and then won two more races, both at Pinjarra. He also placed second and third on the city tracks of Ascot and Belmont. On such a record, it could pay to follow his career in Malaysia. Aside from the Pacific winners and that good run by Omakase, trainer Ricky Choi deserves a mention for saddling the quinella in the fourth trial of the day. As part of a foursome who were locked in battle at the top of the straight, the Choi pair of Platinum Glory and Oriental Halflamma broke away and fought it out over the final furlong with Platinum Glory proving superior. Scrubbed along, he beat his stablemate by a length and, with the trial being run on the slower sand track, he did clock a fairly decent time of 1:02.69. brian@sph.com.sg",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/pacific-spirit-gets-into-the-mood-at-kl-trials
Amateur outlasts pros for massive payday at One Point Slam ahead of Australian Open,"Jan 14, 2026, 09:10 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 09:10 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a1c6c0831c7e2c0968e46225bbeb5ecad051159eb874fa6387ec34c1ae2705ee,,"['Grand Slam', 'Jordan', 'Iga Swiatek']","Jan 14 - An amateur tennis player from Sydney, Jordan Smith, struck gold on Wednesday as he walked away with a cheque worth A$1 million ($661,000) after holding his nerve to win the One Point Slam ahead of the Australian Open. The showdown pitted amateur players and celebrities against an elite field of 24 professionals, which included the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek. Smith, who qualified as the New South Wales state champion, got the better of two-times Australian Open winner Sinner and womens world number four Amanda Anisimova, before beating Joanna Garland in the final. Taiwans Garland, the womens number 117, had reached the final after beating world number three Alexander Zverev, former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios and Maria Sakkari. I dont know anymore. Coming into tonight, I was just happy to win one point. I was so nervous, but I enjoyed being out here. It was a great experience, said Smith, who added he planned to buy a house with his winnings. The event, part of the expanded opening week of the major, featured an elimination draw with rock, paper, scissors used to determine who will serve or receive, and the winner of the point going through to the next round. Amateurs were allowed two serves, but ATP or WTA-ranked players could only have one go. Greeces Sakkari knocked out the mens world number one Alcaraz after he netted a dropshot. The dropshot is my shot, I dont know what happened, a nonplussed Alcaraz said. Six-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek exited at the hands of Spaniard Pedro Martinez, who drew gasps from the crowd at the Rod Laver Arena when he caught world number 10 Alexander Bublik by surprise with an underhand serve. I gave him a taste of his own medicine, Martinez said of Bublik, who is known for his phenomenal touch and penchant for trick shots. The Australian Open runs from January 18 to February 1 at Melbourne Park.

French speed skater Loubineaud puts progress first as he prepares for Olympic debut,"Jan 14, 2026, 08:30 PM","Jan 14, 2026, 08:30 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/60fc67f47b1e03451f732a89afddfd67098f0353034234a8e708a9417295a6f5,"FILE PHOTO: Nov 14, 2025; Kearns, Utah, UNITED STATES; Timothy Loubineaud of France reacts to his world record time in the mens 5000m during the ISU Speedskating World Cup at Utah Olympic Oval. Mandatory Credit: Peter Creveling-Imagn Images/File PhotoREUTERS","['World record', 'World Cup']","Jan 14 - Speed skater Timothy Loubineaud shattered the mens 5,000 metres world record two months ago but will be content to walk away from his first Olympics without a medal if he feels he has turned up in the best possible condition. The Frenchman stunned the field at the World Cup in Salt Lake City in November, crossing the line in six minutes and 0.23 seconds to smash Swedish great Nils van der Poels 2021 record of 6:01.56. While the record thrust Loubineaud into the spotlight, it was steady performances across Olympic qualifying races that secured his status as a leading challenger in the 5,000 m, 10,000 m and mass-start disciplines in Milano-Cortina. I was pretty much not the most confident skater because the weekend before this race (in Salt Lake City), I saw some very good times from the trickier races from the Americans, Loubineaud told Reuters. But I never tried to focus on others - I just focused on myself and did everything as best as I could. The first step I did on the ice in Salt Lake, the first thing I thought was, Oh, today is going to be super fast. That (record) was a pure moment of joy because I worked really hard during the summer to be a better skater. It was cool that it finally paid off. Beyond the record, Loubineaud has built an impressive resume on the World Cup circuit, earning a bronze in the 10,000 m at Heerenveen in 2025-26 and a gold in the mass-start at Nagano in 2024-25. When Loubineaud broke the world record, one of the first congratulatory messages came from his idol and friend, 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic champion Van der Poel. He has played a huge role in my career, Loubineaud said. He taught me so many small details that only he can. Im proud that together we made the skater I am today. SKATING FAMILY Born in Arcachon, a seaside resort town in southwest France, Loubineaud comes from a skating family - his mother was an artistic skater and his father played rink hockey. He started roller skating at age five and switched to speed skating in 2017 after moving to Heerenveen in the Netherlands. I always wanted to be on the ice, he said, recalling how television coverage of the Winter Olympics had inspired him. I told my parents, This is what I want to do in life. But in France, we didnt have anywhere to practice, so it was really hard. He relocated to Bavaria in 2019 to train on Olympic-standard tracks at Inzell - an ambitious step for someone who had largely taught himself the sport. Another major influence is compatriot Alexis Contin, who coached Loubineaud in Berlin and whose long-held French 10,000m record his pupil took in 2020. He had been more than just a coach. He became a great friend. I always wanted to be a skater like him, he explained. BEST VERSION OF MYSELF A police reservist, Loubineaud benefits from Frances national athlete support programme, which offers both financial stability and career opportunities. Thats the best choice Ive made on the human side in the last few years, he said. He also uses his platform to inspire youngsters - not by urging them to follow in his footsteps but by encouraging them to chase their own dreams. The most important thing is having something that motivates you when you wake up in the morning. And for me, my life is about becoming the best version of myself, he added. Loubineaud could make history at Milano-Cortina as France has never won an Olympic medal in speed skating. The 29-year-old, though, is keeping everything in perspective. You can be at the top for a time, but you can be at the lowest just as quick, Loubineaud said. Im a very bad loser, but whats truly important is being the strongest version of myself every day. I want to be better than yesterday - thats my only goal. Theres no magic in this sport - we work hard, we train hard, and I wont be ashamed to say I want to be at my strongest. If theres a medal, thats good. If not, it wont change my life. REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/french-speed-skater-loubineaud-puts-progress-first-as-he-prepares-for-olympic-debut

Cizeron, who is competing at the European Championships this week with new partner Laurence Fournier Beaudry, said he is the target of a smear campaign linked to Papadakis memoir, So as Not to Disappear, which is set for release on Thursday. Papadakis and Cizeron, who teamed up as children, were among the most decorated ice dance teams in history, winning five world championship titles and gold at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. They said they were taking a break in June 2022, and announced their retirement two years later. In excerpts published by French media, Papadakis described an unbalanced relationship, calling Cizeron controlling and demanding, and said she often felt under his grip. In the face of this smear campaign, I want to express my incomprehension and disagreement with the labels attributed to me, Cizeron said in a statement. The book contains false information, including statements I never made, which I consider serious. He added that his lawyers have been instructed to demand an immediate halt to what he called defamatory claims. For more than 20 years, I have shown deep respect for Gabriella Papadakis, Cizeron said. Despite the gradual erosion of our bond, our relationship was built on equal collaboration and marked by success and mutual support. Reuters has contacted Papadakis for comment. Cizeron teamed up with Fournier Beaudry, who previously competed for Canada with Nikolaj Sorensen, last March. Fournier Beaudry received her French citizenship in November, paving the way to Olympic eligibility. They won their two Grand Prix competitions this season, and finished second behind Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates at the Grand Prix Final last month. They are expected to challenge Chock and Bates for gold at the Milano Cortina Olympics, which open on February 6. The rhythm dance at the European Championships is Friday, followed by the free dance on Saturday. Since her retirement, Papadakis has worked as a broadcaster at figure skating events. She is also a big proponent of permitting same-sex teams to compete in ice dance. She and American Madison Hubbell have skated together in exhibitions in a bid to help pave the way for same-sex pairs to compete officially.

The right-arm quick missed Australias 4-1 Ashes victory with a hamstring strain. He subsequently suffered Achilles soreness in his rehabilitation, but was confident he would be ready for Australias tournament opener against Ireland in Colombo on February 11. Everythings going to plan, Hazlewood told the ESPN Cricinfo website. We took a few extra weeks once we couldnt make the test matches. I had a couple of bowls off the half-run last week. Runnings going well, all the strength stuffs going well so, yeah, on track. Hazlewoods availability from the start will be a big boost for Australia, who are fretting over the composition of their pace attack. Australia have named Pat Cummins in the World Cup squad but are considering delaying his return from a lumbar stress injury that prompted the team to rest the quick after his single Ashes appearance in Adelaide. With their Ashes hero Mitchell Starc retiring from T20 internationals, Xavier Bartlett is set to claim the second pace bowling slot in the group stage of the World Cup. After the World Cup, Hazlewood will be in action in the Indian Premier League. Later this year, Australia will enter an 11-month stretch during which they will play up to 21 tests. Hazlewood said it was too early to plan his test workload. (With) white ball, you can really sit down and nut it out because you know youre involved for four or 10 overs pretty much, he said. With the red ball, it is a bit more on the run. You can map out the way you want to train to get ready for that first one, but I think once the tests start then its sort of play it by ear and have those conversations on the go.
