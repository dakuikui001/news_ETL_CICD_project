Playing mahjong to build intergenerational ties,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/03f5c6c97a7b85e2a8ce79e264c68193aa49c0944f29640a49c11a1c8c9c288e,Mahjong Together brings together players young and old over games of mahjong.ST PHOTO: LIU YING,"['TL;DR', 'Volunteering', 'Community centres and clubs']","SINGAPORE – Every Tuesday, elderly residents in Toa Payoh rush to register to ballot for a weekly mahjong session held on Sunday afternoons at their local community club. These sessions – where 24 youth volunteers mingle with 24 elderly residents over mahjong – are so well-received by seniors that they are frequently oversubscribed, and balloting had to be introduced in 2025 to give more people a chance to attend. Im very happy when I get the chance to play, said retiree Kong Yoke Kew, 73, who has been attending the sessions at Toa Payoh West Community Club for two years. I look forward to it every week. These sessions are led by a group of young people who hope to bridge the intergenerational gap through a game that elderly residents can play. Called Mahjong Together, the group was started by students from Dunman High School in 2021. The initiative is now run by a committee of 15 young people that rotates yearly, mostly students, who handle its operations, outreach and recruitment. Youth volunteers for each months sessions are recruited monthly via online-sign ups, with about 70 to 90 volunteers turning up each month to play games at community clubs, active ageing centres and care homes across Singapore. Sessions are mostly organised on an ad-hoc basis, but they run most regularly on Sunday afternoons at Toa Payoh West Community Club. Ms Yap Yihui, a Dunman High School alumnus who is currently a University of Virginia undergraduate, was part of the founding batch of four students who independently initiated the project, as they wanted to do more for their community. The 21-year-old said news stories highlighting loneliness among the elderly during the Covid-19 pandemic spurred her to start the group. Of picking mahjong as the conduit, Ms Yap said: The most important aspect of mahjong is the way it is set up – four people together at a table, half talking and laughing about the game, half catching up about life. This makes it possible for natural conversation to flow. Ms Yap has stepped down from the initiative since going abroad for university, but said the growth of the project has been surreal to witness. She added: I would never have guessed that the project we did in 2021 would have reached this stage, and I am so, so happy with how everything turned out. At a recent session in December 2025, the sound of friendly chatter and mahjong tiles shuffling on tables filled the room as seniors and young people played. First-time volunteer and Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) student Duan Zehao, 16, said that he had a good time playing with the seniors. He said: It was very fun. I even managed to learn some mahjong tips from the seniors I played with.No money changes hands during Mahjong Together sessions, which last three hours each. For some volunteers, their love for mahjong is what initially drew them to join the initiative. I started volunteering in January 2024 with my mahjong kakis after hearing about it in school, said Dunman High School student Harris Lau, 17. I grew up with mahjong and I love to socialize so it was perfect for me. Knowing how to play mahjong is preferred but not necessary for taking part in the initiative. Dunman High School student Reese Chin, 17, was introduced to the initiative by a senior and learnt to play mahjong from other volunteers when she joined the group in January 2025. The Mahjong Together committee member said: I picked the game up quite quickly, but some of the aunties will still jokingly scold me when I play too slowly or make the wrong move. Other youth volunteers said the sense of community kept them coming back to volunteer. Dunman High alumnus Tan Yan Kai, who is currently waiting to enlist in national service, was a committee member in 2024. The 18-year-old returned for his first session in 10 months in December 2025, after taking time off to focus on his A-levels. I was very touched that many of the aunties and uncles still recognised me and asked how Id been, he said. I really missed the atmosphere. I think its very heartwarming for us to give back. Seniors who participate also felt they benefited from and enjoyed the sessions. Ms Doris Tan, 66, a homemaker, said: Its a good way for me to pass the time and it keeps my mind active. I enjoy playing mahjong with young people because I can learn from them, and they can learn from me.Madam Kong said in Mandarin: Its very fun to meet and play with these familiar faces. Playing with these young people also makes me younger.

Half of The Centrepoint up for collective sale at $418m guide price,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:39 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/dc78cd7d970d369cb409740ea65bc5c643b76843f5d13fe54572c7088bdda640,Only the leasehold portion of The Centrepoint in Orchard Road is being offered in this maiden push for a collective sale.BT FILE PHOTO,"['En bloc/collective sale', 'Malls', 'Singapore property']","SINGAPORE –About half of The Centrepoint, the grand dame of Orchard Road in the 1980s, has been put up for collective sale for the first time at a guide price of $418 million on Jan 7. Developed by Frasers Centrepoint (now Frasers Property) and opened in May 1983, the seven-storeyCentrepointincludes a residential complex with 66 units. It comprises Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) plan numbers 1304 and 1298, and straddles two adjoining plots. But only the leasehold portion of the property at 176A Orchard Road – comprising the rear of the mall where 66 strata retail units and residential floors are located under MCST Plan No. 1304 – is being offered in this maiden attempt at a collective sale. The remaining 151 retail units under MCST Plan No. 1298 are not part of this collective sale tender, marketing agent Savills Singapore said. MrJeremy Lake, managing director of investment sales and capital markets at Savills Singapore, said: As the shops and apartment sizes vary significantly, we estimate that each owner or retail tenant will get about 30 per cent above their current open market value. Under the latest URA masterplan, the site is zoned for commercial use with a plot ratio of 5.6 and a maximum height of 10 storeys, allowing for redevelopment into a new mixed-use development. Located in Singapores iconic shopping belt, the property has about 52 years left on its 99-year leasehold tenure, and a site area of about 44,700 sq ft. The $418 million guide price translates to a land rate of $2,709 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr). This is after factoring in a land betterment charge of $260 million for topping up the lease to a fresh 99 years and intensifying the total gross floor area to a plot ratio of 5.6. Only MCST Plan No. 1304, which can be independently redeveloped, received 80 per cent consensus from its unit owners for the development,Mr Lake said. Nothing is happening at MCST 1298 and there are no plans for a sale, he added. According to the Singapore Land Authority, the property has a verified development baseline of approximately 171,482 sq ft, equivalent to a plot ratio of 3.83, and a maximum allowable gross floor area of about 250,320 sq ft. Mr Lake added: Developers have been bidding aggressively for Government Land Sales sites, and some of them will be keen to buy a part of The Centrepoint. For this reason, we are confident we can exceed the guide price of $418 million... With its direct link to Somerset MRT station, excellent accessibility, and location in the heart of Orchard Road, the property offers developers a chance to develop a landmark property with an internationally recognised address. Savills has brokered several major collective sales in Orchard Road, including Concorde Hotel & Shopping Mall at $821 million, or $1,804 psf ppr; Delfi Orchard at $439 million, or $3,346 psf ppr; Tanglin Shopping Centre at $868 million, or $2,769 psf ppr; and Ming Arcade at $172 million or $3,125 psf ppr. There are no restrictions on foreign ownership. The public tender will close on Feb 26 at 3pm.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/half-of-the-centrepoint-up-for-collective-sale-at-418m-guide-price
Electric shock when chewing or talking: When your jaw pain is more than a toothache,"Jan 07, 2026, 04:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 04:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d32a55a50574f60d3a2920581b6327f17ac1d628c986a9149e95e94a2ad1c9a7,"What seems like dental pain could actually be pressure on a facial nerve, also known as trigeminal neuralgia.PHOTO: GETTY IMAGES","['ST A Healthy You', 'Branded content']","It begins suddenly – sharp, electric-shock bursts of facial pain that strike when chewing, talking, brushing teeth, or even when a light breeze touches your cheek. These jolts often follow a distinct pattern along the jaw or cheek, making the pain easy to mistake for a dental problem. But when your dentist finds nothing wrong, the real cause may betrigeminal neuralgia(TN). Trigeminal neuralgia is a neurological condition that occurs when a blood vessel presses on the facial nerve, triggering intense misfires, says Dr Nicolas Kon, a neurosurgeon and TN specialist atNeuro Asia Care. TN pain is often mistaken for dental problems because it can feel as if it originates from the teeth or gums – similar to that of a toothache. As a result, some patients undergo multiple dental treatments or extractions before realising the pain is actually neurological. According to Dr Kon, TN is most often caused by a blood vessel pressing on the nerve, damaging its protective layer and causing it to send pain signals. In rarer cases, conditions such as multiple sclerosis or a small tumour may also irritate the nerve. However, differentiating TN from dental pain is particularly tricky when the lower-jaw branch of the nerve is involved, which Dr Kon says is more common among Asian patients. TN pain is usually brief but extremely sharp and triggered by light touch. Dental pain, on the other hand, is more constant and pressure-sensitive, often worsening when biting down. The condition can significantly affect daily functioning. Dr Kon observes that some patients avoid solid food, stop talking or even smiling for fear of triggering pain, and that they find simple routines such as washing their face or putting on make-up daunting. This constant fear of sudden pain can lead to isolation. People may withdraw from social gatherings, avoid meals with friends or lose confidence at work. Over time, the stress can also lead to sleep problems and low mood, he says. Early signs of TN include short bursts of sharp, electric-like shocks on one side of the face that last for a few seconds but return repeatedly, often triggered by a gentle touch or movement. If the pain keeps recurring over days or weeks, or becomes more frequent, Dr Kon advises early diagnosis and treatment to prevent months, or even years, of unnecessary discomfort. He notes that globally, TN affects about 10 to 300 people per 100,000. In Singapore, TN is slightly more common among women aged 40 to 60, though younger people can also develop it. A detailed medical history, physical examination and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to see if a blood vessel is pressing against the nerve can distinguish TN from dental conditions, notes Dr Kon. While trigeminal neuralgia itself is not life-threatening, a thorough evaluation is important to rule out rare but serious causes such as tumours or multiple sclerosis, he adds. The first line of treatment for mild to moderate symptoms of TN is medication, says Dr Kon. These drugs help calm the overactive nerve signals that cause pain, but they control symptoms rather than cure the condition. They may lose efficacy over time and cause possible side effects like dizziness, drowsiness or brain fog, he notes. For more severe cases, or when medication no longer provides enough relief, other procedural options may be considered, says Dr Kon. These treatments may need to be repeated if symptoms return. One option is gamma knife radiosurgery, a non-invasive outpatient procedure that uses targeted radiation on the nerve root, with pain relief developing gradually over several weeks. Another is radiofrequency ablation, which uses controlled heat delivered through a fine needle to deactivate the part of the nerve causing pain. A third procedure ismicrovascular decompression(MVD) which gently moves the compressing blood vessel away from the nerve. Says Dr Kon: MVD directly addresses the underlying root cause of trigeminal neuralgia and is associated with long-term, medication-free recovery. Performed under general anaesthesia, MVD involves a small incision behind the ear. Using a keyhole approach, the neurosurgeon places a small pad between the nerve and the blood vessel pressing on it. Although every surgical procedure carries risks, MVD is well established and generally safe, says Dr Kon. He notes possible post-surgery side effects such as temporary facial numbness or mild balance problems but they usually resolve with time. By removing the pressure, the nerve can stop sending abnormal pain signals. For most patients, relief is almost immediate, says Dr Kon. For the small group of people who do not experience full relief immediately, the pain is often much milder and easier to manage than before, sometimes requiring only minimal medication. According to Dr Kon, MVD is most suitable for patients with classic TN and clear MRI evidence of a blood vessel compressing the nerve. It may not be ideal for those with medical conditions that make general anaesthesia risky or patients with atypical symptoms. Patients should discuss their personal risk factors with their neurosurgeon to find the safest and most effective path forward, he says.

Over $50 million invested for a network-wide transformational vision,"Jan 07, 2026, 04:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 04:00 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1f17f420ac2897d35c601b9cc6c030fb6e226e44fc7cbcff774d26eb6d59695f,Cycle & Carriage is spending more than $50 million to enhance the customer experience across its network of brands.PHOTO: CYCLE & CARRIAGE,"['Cars', 'Automobile sector', 'Branded content']","Amidst Singapores dynamic and evolving automotive landscape, creating a meaningful customer experience is now more important than ever. This is why Cycle & Carriage is investing over $50 million to refurbish its facilities across its entire network in Singapore, a process that began in 2023 and will continue to 2027. This transformation will be seen in showrooms, service centres and infrastructure with three clear design priorities: hospitality, efficiency and sustainability. Mr Wilfrid Foo, managing director of Cycle & Carriage, says customers in Singapore now expect more than just a vehicle purchase. They expect a seamless, sustainable and digitally-enabled experience end-to-end. Our transformation agenda brings together a diversified brand portfolio, elevated facilities and a clear sustainability road map to meet these expectations, he explains. On the hospitality front, Cycle & Carriage points to lounges with clear sightlines to vehicles. There are also cafe-style engagement zones, offering customers a relaxed and comfortable space to browse catalogues or have discussions with their sales representatives. At the Mercedes-Benz Center, for example, customers can enjoy phygital consultation spaces in semi-private or private settings. This allows customers to explore the physical vehicle while accessing a range of digital customisation options, together with Mercedes-Benz sales consultants providing personalised guidance and expertise. Various upgrades will be progressively rolled out across all of Cycle & Carriages locations, including the Mercedes-Benz Center, the Multi-Brand Complex at 239 Alexandra Road, the Eunos Service Centre, Pandan Loop Service Centre and Pandan Gardens Complex. Over at the Eunos Service Centre, there will be new customer lounges, modernised service bays and streamlined vehicle drop-off and collection, to enhance the overall customer experience and journey. As part of its evolution, Cycle & Carriage plans to progressively achieve Green Mark certification for four of its largest facilities: the Mercedes-Benz Center, Eunos Service Centre, 239 Alexandra Road and Pandan Loop Service Centre by end-2027. In a significant enhancement, 2,252 rooftop solar panels across 6,700 sq m have been installed at Cycle & Carriages Pandan Loop Service Centre. The solar panels will also be installed in the Mercedes-Benz Center later this year. The aim? Generating truly sustainable power and reducing operational carbon footprint. To accelerate its electric vehicle (EV) presence, four new EV DC chargers have been added for owners of Mercedes-Benz cars. For an EV-curious customer, chargers and energy choices affect both convenience and confidence. For fleet buyers, practicality in everyday operations matters even more. To this end, Cycle & Carriages commercial vehicle leasing arm has already moved 100 per cent of its Light Goods Vehicle fleet to fully electric vans. Even its 100 per cent EV last-mile delivery service, myCourier, is racking up wins, with 120,000 kgCO₂e in greenhouse gas emissions saved for partners in 2024 – a number that speaks directly to business customers trying to decarbonise without compromising delivery performance. Addressing the idea that consumers today are spoilt for choice, yet appreciate the familiarity of a trusted hand, Cycle & Carriage has expanded its multi-brand portfolio while keeping the experience consistent. Its newer additions include EV brands such as Ora, Smart, Gogoro and Leapmotor, and a range of commercial vehicle solutions. Ora, Smart and Leapmotor offer a selection of compact to family-sized vehicles designed to meet diverse city and everyday mobility needs. Gogoro, on the other hand, offers electric two-wheelers with the worlds first two-wheel battery-swopping system. Cycle & Carriage is also investing in the physical spaces that reflect its multi-brand strategy. The Multi-Brand Complex at 239 Alexandra Road, for instance, houses Kia, Ora, Maxus, Peugeot, Leapmotor and Citroen, alongside the groups headquarters, with updates including a new Leapmotor showroom and refreshed showcase areas for Kia, Ora and Maxus. Says Mr Foo: The Cycle & Carriage brand and product portfolio aims to continually address different segments and needs across passenger and commercial mobility. Our brands are complementary by design. They enable choice, advance electrification and deliver value across private and commercial segments. This is how we aim to meet the diverse needs of Singapores mobility ecosystem. While $50 million may be a big number, the intent is clearly bigger: ensuring Cycle & Carriage remains relevant, even while electrification accelerates, sustainability expectations rise and customers judge brands as much by service experience as they do by specification sheets.

They are accused of committing their offences between 2017 and 2022. Suriamoorthy Subakaran, 47, who was a project manager at Bharath Electrical Engineering at the time of the alleged offences, was handed the most charges – six. He is accused of offences including engaging in a conspiracy with Sundarraj Manikandan, then a project engineer at ALSG, to falsify invoices. Sundarraj also operated a company called Voltz Engineering Works, said the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). On two separate occasions between June and August 2021, the pair allegedly worked together to falsify two invoices amounting to around $130,000 as payments to Voltz for jobs purportedly provided by Bharath Electrical. In reality, these works were not performed. These payments represented benefits from criminal conduct of another individual, and they were allegedly found to be in Suriamoorthys possession, CPIB said. During the same period, Suriamoorthy also allegedly conspired with Vedaiyan Raja Mohan, 46, to falsify two invoices amounting to $113,200 as payments to Bharath Electrical for works purportedly provided by Zhan Tech which were, in fact, never performed. Vedaiyan was a director of Zhan Tech at the time. He was handed two counts each of falsifying an invoice and dealing with the benefits of alleged criminal conduct by Upadhyay Abhishekumar Rajendrabhai, then a former senior procurement engineer of ALSG. Lim Siew Hock, 60, and Ng Teck Leng, 61, were each handed three charges for offences including graft. Both of them were directors at LDC General Construction at the time of the alleged offences. CPIB said that in 2020, Lim allegedly conspired with Ng to give bribes of up to $125,000 to Sundarrajto further the business interests of LDC with ALSG. Separately, between December 2019 and September 2022, Lim allegedly conspired with Ng and Sundarraj to falsify two invoices amounting to $179,570 as payment for works purportedly provided by LDC and Voltz, which were, in fact, never performed.

The appeal followed aDec 26, 2025, High Court decisiondismissing the companys application for temporary protection from creditors. Collectively, the group of companies owed creditors more than $300 million, a significant part of which was for hire-purchase of motor vehicles. In a statement to The Straits Times on Jan 6, Mr Clarence Lun of law firm Fervent Chambers, which represents Autobahn Rent A Car and its associated companies, said: Our client has decided to pause business due to operational constraints and insurance cancellation. Our client will continue to work with hirers and creditors to return the vehicles for a seamless transition. Mr Lun added that Autobahn had already notified its creditors about the withdrawal of the appeal. At least two creditors confirmed to ST that they were informed on the afternoon of Jan 6. Autobahns creditors include major banks and finance companies. Among them,DBS Bank is owed $103 million, UOB $17 million and OCBC Bank $12.5 million. The debt relates to hire-purchase agreements, business loans, mortgages and fees. Collectively, Autobahn and its group of related companies have 1,700 vehicles, mainly rented out for ride-hailing services. This development follows Shariots announcement on Dec 31, 2025,that it was pausing its vehicle rental servicesuntil further notice. On Dec 29, accounting and business advisory firm Baker Tilly was appointed by one of the banks as the receiver of 58 cars, which were supplied to Autobahn Rent A Car. These vehicles, registered between 2022 and 2025, include models such as the BMW 116i, Honda Step Wgn, Toyota Alphard, Toyota Sienta and Suzuki Landy. Mr Timothy Reid, a principal at Baker Tilly, told ST that the firm has been unable to locate these vehicles. He said the cars cannot be legally driven on the road as they lack motor insurance, and many do not have valid road tax. Every registered vehicle in Singapore must have valid road tax and insurance coverage to be on the road. Mr Reid did not disclose which bank appointed Baker Tilly when asked, but said that the firm reached out to Autobahn in late December 2025 regarding the vehicles whereabouts. On the evening of Jan 6, 2026, Baker Tilly posted the registration numbers of the cars on itswebsiteand appealed to drivers to contact it immediately. The firm advised that vehicles should not be returned to any entity or location without the receivers instruction. We want the drivers to get in touch with us so that we can work out how they can continue to use the cars, said Mr Reid. The fallout has already impacted drivers. Mr Ivan Seah, 52, who had been renting a Toyota Alphard from Autobahn Rent A Car for six months, returned the luxury multi-purpose vehicle to financing company Teck Wei Credit in late December 2025. He did so after learning about the High Court dismissing Autobahns application for protection. The limousine driver said that Teck Wei Credit did not have details of the vehicle hirers and was grateful that he volunteered to return the car. Mr Seah has since rented a vehicle from another leasing company. He does not expect to recover his $1,280 rental deposit from Autobahn, adding: With so many big banks owed so much money, we (drivers) are only the small fish. We just have to move on. On Jan 5, the National Private Hire Vehicles Association, which represents private-hire drivers, said on its Facebook page that it had met affected drivers to address ongoing rental-related issues, vehicle repossessions linked to financial difficulties at rental companies. Besides offering guidelines on how to handle such situations, the association, which is an affiliate of the National Trades Union Congress, also encouraged affected members to reach out for assistance, adding that it is also working with alternative rental companies to help these members.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/autobahn-rent-a-car-suspends-business-at-least-one-bank-moves-to-locate-cars-under-finance

The photo has since been removed from his Instagram account. Im now not a member of any party, he said on Jan 6. Dr Haresh, a family physician at National University Polyclinics, added that he had archived the photo as part of a clean-up of the Instagram account to protect the identities of the people in the pictures, as he had made the account public. In the post, he said he received queries about his political affiliation after the photo surfaced. He added that he had previously told the South China Morning Post that the activity he was volunteering at was run by the Peoples Association (PA), and clarified that it did not involve the PA, which is a statutory board. Dr Haresh did not respond to queries from The Straits Times on when he left the PAP, or if he had held leadership positions in grassroots organisations in Tampines. A check of his profile on networking site LinkedIn on Jan 6 showed that he has been a grassroots leader since January 2023. ST has contacted the PAP for comment. The photo of Dr Haresh in a PAP T-shirt has resurfaced questions about the non-partisan nature of the NMP scheme, which came under scrutiny in February 2025 after two sitting NMPs resigned with the intention of joining a political party. Lawyer Raj Joshua Thomas and psychiatrist Syed Harun Alhabsyisubmitted their resignations to the Speaker of Parliament on Feb 14,and Dr Syed Harun later ran in the May 2025 General Election. He was elected as an MP for Nee Soon GRC under the PAP banner and later appointed Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education and National Development. It was the first time since the scheme was mooted in 1990 that any NMP had resigned before the end of their 2½-year term. Past NMPs linked to political parties include banker Tan Su Shan, who left the PAP in 2011 to become an NMP. Entrepreneur Calvin Cheng, whose membership in Young PAP was revealed after he was announced as an NMP in 2009, also quit the party. Former National Kidney Foundation chairman Gerard Ee remained in the PAP after becoming an NMP in 1997, saying then that he would not be subject to the party whip in the role. The NMP scheme is meant to ensure a wide representation of views in Parliament. Nominees should have performed distinguished public service, brought honour to Singapore or distinguished themselves in their respective fields. Dr Haresh is one ofnine people selected to enter Parliament as NMPs earlier in January. The other eight comprise academics and business and union leaders. President Tharman Shanmugaratnam will present them with the instruments of appointment at the Istana on Jan 8, and they will then take their oaths and affirmations at the next sitting of Parliament on Jan 12.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/incoming-nmp-haresh-singaraju-says-hes-no-longer-a-party-member-after-photo-in-pap-shirt-surfaces

Chong Jun Keong, 21, was caught on July 11, 2025, when Health Sciences Authority (HSA) officers raided one of the warehouses, located in an industrial building in Jalan Pemimpin in Bishan. The Malaysian was charged on July 14 withdistributing about 2,915kg of vapes and components. On Jan 6, 2026, he was sentenced to 41 weeks jail after he pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of vapes and related components for sale. Another two similar charges were considered for his sentencing. The court heard that officers found Chong exiting the warehouse during the July 11 raid. He claimed that he was alone and had been assigned to pack orders. A total of 17,955 vapes and 29,522 related components were seized from the warehouse at Jalan Pemimpin. Officers then checked Chongs mobile phone and found the address of a second warehouse located at another industrial building in Ubi Avenue 3. The keys to the warehouse were found in Chongs vehicle. HSA officers went to the second warehouse at about 4.20pm on the same day and seized 5,564 vapes and 13,412 related components. HSA prosecutor Vishnu Aditya Naidu told the court that Chong was working as a sales assistant at a mobile phone shop in Johor Bahru, which also sold vapes, and earned about RM6,000 (S$1,900) a month. In July 2024, he became acquainted with one of his customers, identified in court documents as John. In April 2025, John asked Chong if he wanted to work as a packer for vapes in Singapore for $100 a day. Chong began working for John twice a week some time in May 2025. His job scope included packing parcels according to Johns instructions and handing them over to delivery drivers once he was done. He would also receive new stocks and restock both warehouses. Occasionally, he would help John transport vapes and their components from the warehouse in Bishan to Ubi. In sentencing, Deputy Principal District Judge Kessler Soh said a custodial sentence was warranted in view of the need for deterrence. For each charge of selling or distributing vapes, an offender can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.",https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/41-weeks-for-packer-caught-in-vape-warehouse-with-over-40000-vapes-and-components

Andy Wong/Pool via REUTERS","['Beef', 'Ireland', 'China']","BEIJING, Jan 6 - China wants to deepen cooperation with Ireland and broaden trade in sectors including aircraft leasing and healthcare, according to a Chinese state media readout on Tuesday following Premier Li Qiangs meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, who is in Beijing to push for agriculture talks. Martins meeting with Li came a day after his summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, part of a five-day visit that the Irish leader said would have a significant economic dimension including talks on beef and dairy. The visit reflects Beijings bid to strengthen ties with individual European nations amid strained China-EU relations. Tuesdays Chinese readout also listed green energy and artificial intelligence as areas for enhanced cooperation but made no mention of beef or dairy. Li described the two economies as highly complementary and called for upholding multilateralism and free trade, according to state broadcaster CCTV late Tuesday. In a clip posted earlier on Martins X account, the prime minister said he pressed Chinese officials for the reopening of the Chinese market to Irish beef products, and raised issues related to Chinas new dairy tariffs. China-EU ties have been tense since the EU imposed levies on Chinese EV imports in 2024, prompting Chinese retaliation including tariffs on EU dairy products. Ireland will always be constructive on trading matters. Weve always been in the school within the European Union that has favoured open trade, Martin said on Irish radio. BEEF EXPORTS Ireland exports the bulk of its output from its beef and dairy industries, which are major employers in the country. It is among Europes largest exporters of dairy, shipping about 6 billion euros ($7.04 billion) annually. Irish beef exports to China have been suspended since 2024 after a mad cow disease case. On a visit to China in November, Junior Minister for Agriculture Timmy Dooley said Dublin was making progress in persuading Beijing that Irish beef was safe but that there was a way to go to clear the resumption of exports. Irish beef, which the country markets as a premium commodity in the UK and Europe, also faces competition from cheaper South American imports. Last week, China also set import quotas and extra tariffs on beef imports from this year, hitting global suppliers. Martin, the first Taoiseach to visit China since 2012, has recently downplayed Irish intelligence warnings portraying China as a hostile state actor, preferring instead to adopt a long-term and strategic understanding of China.

But at South Korean President Lee Jae Myungs request, Mr Xi gamelyposed for one with Mr Leeat the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after a state banquet held in the latters honour on Jan 5. He then posed for another shot with Mr Lee and their spouses. Mr Xi even quipped after the selfie was taken: The photo-taking skill is not bad! The phone Mr Lee used is a Xiaomi modelgifted by Mr Xi during their first summiton the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting on Nov 1, 2025, in the South Korean city of Gyeongju. On Jan 6, the selfie of the two presidents trended on Chinese social media platform Weibo, with many netizens praising Mr Lees use of the Chinese smartphone. One of them joked: Xiaomi now has a new brand ambassador! This second summitwas held just over nine weeks after their first meeting – an unusually short interval given the recent history of frosty bilateral relations between both countries. Mr Lee hailed 2026 as the year for full-scale restoration of South Korea-China relations, while Mr Xi pledged to conduct more frequent exchanges and closer communication. Beyond the show of new-found chumminess between the two leaders, analysts said the summit also underscores a wider strategic calculus by Beijing, which is shaped byChinas ongoing tensions with Japan, as well as its growing rivalry with the United States. Dr Lee Seong-hyon, a senior fellow at the Washington-based George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, said the timing of the second summit – coming so soon after the pair met at APEC – was no coincidence and unmistakably directed at Japan. He was referring to the ongoing spat between Beijing and Tokyo overJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichis Taiwan remarks. Ms Takaichi had suggested in November 2025 that any use of force by Beijing against Taiwan, which China claims as its own, could justify a military response by Japan. Mr Lees visit to China was announced on Dec 30, mere days before heflew to Beijing on Jan 4. The visit was also rather conveniently timed, taking place just before Mr Lees planned summit with Ms Takaichi in the Japanese city of Nara. Japanese media reported in mid-December that both leaders will meet on Jan 13 and 14, but there has been no official confirmation. Dr Lee said Mr Xi was employing a classic differentiation strategy.The message to Tokyo, and to the Japanese public, is deliberate: Engagement yields respect and tangible benefits, while containment leads to distance, he told The Straits Times. By showcasing Seouls pragmatism, Mr Xi aims to cast Tokyos approach as rigid, subtly shaping the atmosphere ahead of the Lee-Takaichi talks. Mr Lees four-day trip marks the first South Korean presidential visit to China since 2019. Seoul-Beijing ties had been frosty since Seouls deployment of the US THAAD missile defence system in 2017 despite Beijings protests. Relations remained fraught under the previous conservative Yoon Suk Yeol administration, which sought to align more closely with its US ally. By contrast, the new liberal administration helmed by Mr Lee traditionally adopts a more China-friendly approach. In a thinly veiled swipe at Japan during the Jan 5 meeting, Mr Xi referenced China and South Koreas shared struggle against Japanese militarism more than 80 years ago, urging Seoul to stand firmly with Beijing on the right side of history and make correct strategic choices. Mr Lee caught the drift, responding deftly that both countries had fought side by side to restore lost sovereignties during World War II, and that Seoul and Beijing have a mutually beneficial partnership that cannot be separated. Research fellow Lee Dong-gyu of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul told ST that Mr Xis comments are a clear indicator that China wants South Korea to support its position against Japan. However, he warned that despite the temptation to play a mediating role, Mr Lees administration should avoid being seen as representing Chinas position in its dialogue with Japan. Associate Professor Zhang Guangxin at Zhejiang Gongshang Universitys East Asian Institute in Hangzhou said China recognises South Koreas dilemma of being caught in a narrow space amid the China-US rivalry – relying on the US for security while being deeply intertwined with China economically. But he noted that Beijing also has clear expectations for China-South Korea relations as trade protectionism rises and the regional security environment becomes more volatile. Mr Xi had said during the summit that China and South Korea are both beneficiaries of globalisation, and should therefore work together to oppose protectionism and practise true multilateralism. If South Korea can adhere to a pragmatic path of not choosing sides and prioritising mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, Seoul may be able to achieve dual gains in both security and economic interests, noted Prof Zhang. During the summit, both countries signed 14 memorandums of understanding covering cooperation in industrial exchanges, technology and the environment. Mr Lee was accompanied on his visit by some 200 South Korean business leaders, including heads of major conglomerates such as Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor Group, SK Group and LG Group. The visit also saw the restoration of theKorea-China Business Forumafter a nine-year hiatus, which Mr Lee attended before his summit with Mr Xi. In his opening remarks at the forum, Mr Lee called for greater cooperation in the manufacturing sector and active exchanges in cultural content with China. China has been South Koreas largest trading partner for 21 consecutive years, with bilateral trade hovering around US$300 billion (S$384 billion) annually. The Washington-based Dr Lee believed that Mr Xi also timed the summit with Mr Lee ahead of US leader Donald Trumpsplanned visit to Beijing in April, and with the US midterm elections looming in November. In the context of the long-term, drawn-out US-China rivalry, Mr Xi wants his periphery stabilised before that moment arrives. By locking in 14 cooperation agreements now, particularly in supply chains, Mr Xi is effectively constructing a diplomatic firewall, said Dr Lee.The objective is to reduce Seouls manoeuvrability as a potential bargaining chip for Washington when Mr Trump enters the room, he added. From Beijings perspective, this is about securing what it sees as the critical pivot point in the US alliance network before the principal adversary engages directly. Despite promises of greater cooperation, there appeared to be little progress on Seouls other key priorities in meeting with Beijing: North Korea, andSouth Koreas dispute with Chinaover the latters structures in the West Sea, known as the Yellow Sea in China. Professor Leif-Eric Easley of the Ewha Womans University in Seoul said that despite Seouls diplomatic efforts, China has not adopted more internationally responsible policies on maritime disputes or Pyongyangs nuclear threats. While the Chinese Foreign Ministrys readout of the summit did not include references to North Korea nor the West Sea/Yellow Sea, South Koreas presidential office issued a written briefing on Jan 5, saying that both leaders had shared recognition for transforming the West Sea/Yellow Sea into a peaceful and co-prosperous sea and that China had assured Mr Lee of its willingness to play a constructive role in the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula. As part of his visit, Mr Lee also met Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Chinas top legislator, Mr Zhao Leji, on Jan 6, before heading to Shanghai where he will meet the citys party secretary, Mr Chen Jining. Mr Lee will also attend the Korea-China Venture Startup Summit before returning to Seoul on Jan 7.",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/xi-lee-summit-signals-thaw-in-relations-sends-strategic-message-to-japan-us-analysts

OAE secretary-general Piraphan Khorthong said Thai exporters face stronger competition from durian producers in Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia, alongside tighter Chinese screening requirements. Mr Piraphan said China would rigorously test durians for prohibited substances and contamination, including Basic Yellow 2 dye and cadmium. He added that exporters should source durians only from orchards that meet Good Agricultural Practice standards, while the cleaning and packing process must comply with Good Manufacturing Practice. As a result, he said, both durian orchards and export packing houses must be registered with the Department of Agriculture to obtain certification for exports to China. Mr Piraphan also advised exporters to consider using the Laos-China high-speed rail link instead of road transport, saying rail shipments can deliver durians to Kunming in just two days. However, he noted that rail transport costs are about 10 per cent to 15 per cent higher than road haulage. Even so, Mr Piraphan said rail transport allows better temperature control, helping to maintain fruit quality. Despite stronger competition, Mr Piraphan said durian production in 2026 is expected to rise by 15.71 per cent from 2025. The OAE estimates output at 1.781 million tonnes. In 2024, Thailand exported 859,157 tonnes of durian worth 134.85 billion baht (S$5.52 billion).

Thailand became the first country in Asia todecriminalise cannabis in 2022, but has since tightened its regulation in a series of policy changes. According to a draft of an amended Health Ministry regulation on controlled herbs, sales of cannabis will be allowed only at medical facilities, shops selling herbal products, pharmacies and through traditional medicine practitioners. Establishments must also have at least one practitioner who has completed training from the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine, on duty during operating hours, the draft regulation said. The changes are currently under legal review, after which it will be signed and implemented, according to local media reports citing Public Health Minister Pattana Promphat, who did not give further details on the timeline. He added that the changes will not affect patients who rely on cannabis for medical purposes. Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakuls Bhumjaithai Party spearheaded the decriminalisation of cannabis, but has toughened its policy in an attempt to court conservative voters ahead of Februarys election. The new rules will deepen uncertainty for the fledgling cannabis industry, which had grown to more than 18,000 dispensaries by the end of 2025. More than 7,000 are expected to close in 2026, as they did not seek to renew their licenses, Mr Pattana said. Mr Prasitchai Nunual, secretary-general of Writing Thailands Cannabis Future advocacy group, said the new rules will push small dispensaries out of business. If it has to be a medical facility, no one can do it, he said, adding that only stores backed by big business would be able to afford the changes. It is the latest in a series of policy changes after the landmark decriminalisation policy unleashed liberal uses of cannabis, including recreational smoking. Two subsequent administrations have sought to recriminalise cannabis and reel back recreational use that has flourished in popular tourist areas and even in Bangkoks business districts. There has also been a surge in cannabis smuggling across borders, the authorities have said. Since mid-2025, buyers must obtain medical prescriptions to buy cannabis and dispensaries are required to sell cannabis only produced by farms that have obtained the Good Agricultural and Collection Practices certifications issued by the government. Sales are capped at a 30-day supply per customer. BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailand-plans-new-cannabis-rules-to-rein-in-dispensary-boom
Climate-driven tree deaths speeding up in Australia: Study,"Jan 06, 2026, 06:30 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 06:30 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/79ee6f867287421922cddf13d9760bd0772b1201627e7fde4d4611cda161e874,"The research found that the deaths were not being matched by tree growth, so forest stock overall is declining.PHOTO: UNSPLASH","['Australia', 'Climate change', 'Trees']","BANGKOK - Australias forests are losing trees more rapidly as the climate warms, a new study examining decades of data said on Jan 6, warning that the trend was likely a widespread phenomenon. The research used forest inventory data from 2,700 plots across the country, ranging from cool moist forests to dry savanna. It excluded areas affected by logging, clearance or fires to examine how background tree mortality has changed in recent decades. What we found is that the mortality rate has consistently increased over time, in all of the different forest types, said Professor Belinda Medlyn from Western Sydney Universitys Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment. And this increase is very likely caused by the increase in temperature, she told AFP. The world has warmed by an average of nearly 1.2 deg C since the pre-industrial era. Most of this warming has occurred in the last 50 years. The rate at which trees die off in a forest can vary in response to different types of disturbances, or as forests grow thicker and there is greater competition for resources. But the research, published in the Nature Plants journal, excluded areas affected by fires or clearing, and also examined the stand basal area – the sum of the cross-sectional areas of all trees in an area. The (mortality) trend over time remains even after we correct for basal area, explained Prof Medlyn, who led the research. The scale of the increase varied across the four different biomes surveyed, with the sharpest rise in tropical savannas. There, the number of trees dying on average increased by 3.2 per cent a year, from close to 15 per 1,000 in 1996, to nearly double that number by 2017. The research found that the deaths were not being matched by tree growth, so forest stock overall is declining. That makes it very likely that the overall carbon storage capacity in the forests is declining over time, said Prof Medlyn. And given the trend was observed across four ecosystems – tropical savanna, cool temperate forest, warm temperate forest and tropical rainforest – it is likely to be a widespread phenomenon, not just an Australian thing, she added. The rising mortality rate tracks warming and drying linked to climate change, and the study found the fastest rise in hotter, dryer regions. The research comes months after a study found Australias tropical rainforests were among the first in the world to start emitting more carbon dioxide than they absorb. Taken together, the findings paint a worrying picture of our continued ability to rely on forests to absorb our emissions. Forests globally currently sequester about one-third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, said Prof Medlyn. Our study suggests their capacity to act as buffer will decline over time.AFP",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/climate-driven-tree-deaths-speeding-up-in-australia-study

Growing unease in Asia-Pacific as US strike on Venezuela challenges rules-based order,"Jan 06, 2026, 05:45 PM","Jan 06, 2026, 07:52 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/5a30b95b1e2af2fa3f70a4d88e6c9dac0ef66108847042365622781c32b6b360,Captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro being escorted to a courthouse in New York on Jan 5 for an initial appearance to face US. federal charges.PHOTO: REUTERS,"['Venezuela', 'Nicolas Maduro', 'United States', 'Philippines', 'Japan']","MANILA– While governments across the Asia-Pacific region have responded cautiously to theUS attack on Venezuela, lawmakers and former officials have hit out at Washingtons move, saying its actions risk accelerating the erosion of the rules-based international order. In particular, the episode has drawn pointed rebukes in countries that rely on international law to push back against stronger powers – a concern that resonates deeply in Asias contested security landscape. For Asian states facing flashpoints such as in the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula, the issue is less Venezuela itself than the precedent the recent US military action sets. Analysts warn that a further slide towards might-makes-right behaviour could leave smaller states more exposed in a world increasingly shaped by power rather than rules. In the Philippines, opposition lawmaker Leila de Lima stood apart from the governments more calibrated tone, as the Department of Foreign Affairs called on all parties to respect the UN Charter and exercise restraint to prevent escalation. Ms de Lima argued that the US military operation in Venezuela undermined the rules-based international order and weakened the Philippines moral position as it confronts Chinas assertiveness in the West Philippine Sea. The West Philippine Sea is the name used by Manila for parts of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone. As a US ally, this leaves the Philippines with a compromised moral ascendancy in opposing Chinese actions, she warned. Likewise, Japanese former defence minister Itsunori Onodera described the US move as the very definition of changing the status quo by force and warned it could undermine efforts to rally international opinion against China and Russia. Japanese media editorials were also broadly critical, with the Yomiuri daily cautioning that if major powers prioritise military force over international law, the international order itself would be at risk. In contrast, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi avoided commenting on whether the US violated international law, using carefully worded remarks that did not mention Washington or US President Donald Trump by name. Political scientist Aries Arugay, a visiting senior fellow at Singapores ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, said the Venezuela episode was significant for Asia because it appeared to confirm a shift in US behaviour under Mr Trump. The US has traditionally presented itself as a status quo power that upholds the rules-based international order, he said. What we are seeing under Trump 2.0 is much less interest in maintaining that order. That is bad news for us in Asia, he added, noting that countries such as the Philippines, Japan and South Korea have relied on the US as a stabiliser against Chinas hegemonic behaviour. Our precarity just got intensified. Dr Tosh Minohara, chair of Kobe-based think-tank Research Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said Washingtons action indicates that the rule of law, which used to be a big American thing, is malleable under Mr Trump. It proves the point that since the US is powerful, it gets to set the rules, he said. But what it does not realise is that this puts off a lot of countries and fuels anti-American resentment that manifests itself in a way that is not readily apparent. Meanwhile, Indonesia has emerged as one of the more forceful official voices in South-east Asia. It issued a carefully worded statement expressing deep concern over the use or threat of force, adding a warning that such actions risk setting a dangerous precedent in international relations. Indonesias Foreign Ministry stressed that respect for sovereignty, diplomacy and international humanitarian law was essential, particularly the protection of civilians, signalling unease over how quickly military force was deployed in the snatch-and-grab operation that whisked away Venezuelas sitting President Nicolas Maduro from a fortified compound in the heart of capital Caracas. India, which has sought to preserve strategic autonomy amid competing pressures, expressed deep concern without directly criticising Washington. Analysts noted that Indias stance is linked to New Delhis reluctance to antagonise the US amid ongoing trade tensions – especially with trade talks reaching the final stages – and its broader caution in conflicts involving its partners. It would be odd if India, which didnt condemn the invasion of Ukraine, had condemned the US invasion of Venezuela, said Dr Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at New Delhis Observer Research Foundation. In Singapore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said the Republicis gravely concerned by the US intervention in Venezuela. Singapore is deeply committed to international law and the principles of the UN Charter that safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, especially small states. Singapore has consistently opposed actions contrary to international law by any parties, including foreign military intervention in any country, MFA said in a statement on Jan 4. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who is on a state visit to China until Jan 7, did not directly comment on the US operation but instructed his Foreign Ministry to prepare to evacuate South Koreans in Venezuela if needed. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, meanwhile, urged all parties to support dialogue and diplomacy to prevent escalation, saying Canberra continued to support international law and a peaceful, democratic transition in Venezuela. He also noted longstanding concerns about Venezuelas democratic and human rights record. Taiwan stood out for its more bullish reading of recent events. In comments reported by Bloomberg, Taiwanese officials framed the Venezuela operation as a demonstration of US military capability and deterrence, arguing that Beijing was constrained less by precedent than by capacity. Online reaction in Taiwan, however, was divided, with some warning that the US operation could embolden China. For US partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the Venezuela episode has become a reminder of an uncomfortable reality, which is that while US military power remains central to regional deterrence, the credibility of the rules it once championed is no longer assured. So, what can we do? The other option really is that the burden of upholding the rules-based international order now falls into the hands of small to middle-sized countries, said Dr Arugay.

REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane/File Photo","['Greenland', 'Foreign policy', 'Arctic']","WASHINGTON, Jan 6 - U.S. President Donald Trump and his team are discussing options for acquiring Greenland and the use of the U.S. military in furtherance of the goal is always an option, the White House said on Tuesday. Trumps ambition of acquiring Greenland as a strategic U.S. hub in the Arctic, where there is growing interest from Russia and China, has been revived in recent days in the wake of the U.S. arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Greenland has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States. The White House said in a statement in response to queries from Reuters that Trump sees acquiring Greenland as a U.S. national security priority necessary to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chiefs disposal, the White House said. A senior U.S. official said discussions about ways to acquire Greenland are active in the Oval Office and that advisers are discussing a variety of options. Strong statements in support of Greenland from NATO leaders have not deterred Trump, the official said. Its not going away, the official said about the presidents drive to acquire Greenland during his remaining three years in office. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said options include the outright U.S. purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory. A COFA agreement would stop short of Trumps ambition to make the island of 57,000 people a part of the U.S. A potential purchase price was not provided. Diplomacy is always the presidents first option with anything, and dealmaking. He loves deals. So if a good deal can be struck to acquire Greenland, that would definitely be his first instinct, the official said. Administration officials argue the island is crucial to the U.S. due to its deposits of minerals with important high-tech and military applications. These resources remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and other challenges. Leaders from major European powers and Canada rallied behind Greenland on Tuesday, saying the Arctic island belongs to its people.

Picture taken October 5, 2017. REUTERS/Isaac Urrutia/File Photo","['Trade', 'United States']","HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, Jan 6 - Government officials in Caracas and Washington are discussing exporting Venezuelan crude to refiners in the United States, five government, industry and shipping sources told Reuters on Tuesday, a deal that could divert supplies away from China while helping state company PDVSA avoid deeper output cuts. Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump since mid-December. The blockade was part of rising U.S. pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him this weekend. A potential deal to sell the trapped crude to the U.S. could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources said. The Asian country has been Venezuelas top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020. The supply would increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the U.S., a flow that is currently controlled entirely by Chevron , PDVSAs main joint venture partner, under a U.S. authorization. Chevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the U.S., has emerged in recent weeks as the only company fluidly loading and shipping crude from the South American country amid the blockade. PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. If PDVSA does not find a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said. The White House, Venezuelan government officials and PDVSA did not immediately comment. Venezuelas oil ministry has said the U.S. wants to steal the countrys oil reserves and denounced Maduros capture as a kidnapping. U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuelas heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela. It was not immediately clear how sanctioned PDVSA would obtain proceeds from the oil sales. The officials have been in talks this week about possible sale mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested U.S. buyers to participate in cargo offers, and the issuance of U.S. licenses to PDVSAs business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources said. The parties have also discussed if the Venezuelan crude can refill the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said.

A year ago, artificial intelligence (AI) was dismissed as too dim-witted for the front lines of finance. But Mr David Yin, a partner at Informed Ventures, has now backed an outfit that runs bookkeeping, tax compliance and financial analysis for start-ups and small firms, powered by both generative agents and licensed professionals. Two young coders helm the start-up that provides end-to-end accounting at a fraction of the fees traditional firms charge for transaction sorting, bank reconciliation, book closing and analysis. As an investor, I have been shocked at how quickly companies are progressing in underlying technology, said Mr Yin, a 35-year-old Singaporean who has worked in the San Francisco Bay Area for around five years. A year ago, for instance, it was said that AI was too dumb to do finance, but over the last six months, people have started using AI assistants to do just that. Im not saying they are perfect, but they have started becoming very powerful. Mr Yins Menlo Park, California-based venture capital fund has poured around US$300 million (S$384 million) into early healthcare and fintech bets. The accounting start-up employs certified public accountants to vet the bots output, keeping the essential human oversight on taxes and audits. Still, Mr Yin spots the chill. Firms are not hiring – they are pruning. A lot of us underestimate how powerful AI is and how good the models could become in the next three to five years. Most of the companies Im talking to are trying not to hire people. They are trying to cut people, if anything. A ripple of unease is spreading across the US economy as the prospect of AI-related job losses conjures up dark scenarios like offices without young people because entry-level jobs are no longer open. And, maybe, even mass unemployment if the trend accelerates. Over a million jobs were lost in the US in 2025, the highest number since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused economic disruptions worldwide. AI was cited in at least 54,694 of those layoffs, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The numbers could be higher. As AI began to be more widely adopted across the economy, several influential corporate figures spoke in 2025 of its game-changing capabilities. AI will do nearly everything within a decade – making, moving and growing things – while humans choose to take on some jobs like playing professional baseball, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in an interview in March 2025. People will be free to choose to work only if they feel like it, said Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. In less than 20 years, maybe even as little as 10 or 15 years, the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional, Mr Musk said in a November 2025 podcast. Mr Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, whose AI can almost code like a human, predicted that half of all entry-level white-collar jobs would vanish within five years. The job of a CEO would not be immune from being assumed by AI either. What a CEO does is maybe one of the easier things… for an AI to do, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a November interview. Mr Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which took the world by a storm with its large language models like the GPT series, said: Shame on me if OpenAI is not the first big company run by an AI CEO. A prominent dissenter was Mr Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, which designs the advanced chips that power AI. Asked if AI could replace him, he shot down the idea. Absolutely not, he said during an October 2024 event,suggestingthat AI could do 20 per cent to 50 per cent of someones job a thousand times better, but could not do all of it. That may change. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researchers built a digital twin of the US labour market and counted jobs which AI could perform at a cost that is either competitive or cheaper than human labour. Their study, released in November 2025, found that one in nine jobs – across finance, healthcare, logistics, human resources and professional services – could already be done by AI. That is around 151 million workers, representing more than US$1 trillion in pay. Stanford Universitys Dr Erik Brynjolfsson and his co-authors of a report looking at labour market shifts following the widespread adoption of generative AI used the term canaries in the coal mine to describe what is happening to early-career workers, aged 22 to 25, in occupations highly exposed to AI, such as working in software development and as customer service representatives. Their professional demise would serve as an early warning of impending danger, just like the death of the birds in the expression alerted workers to evacuate the mine before toxic gases killed them, too. Young workers saw a 13 per cent dip in employment from late 2022 to mid-2025, the Stanford team documented in their November 2025 researchreport,and concluded that a structural transformation of the labour market was well under way. Mr Yin said he had observed that companies are trying not to hirenewbies. With AI handling basic work, who needs an intern anymore? Who needs a copywriter? Who needs a researcher? So that makes it very difficult for young people to find their first job, he said. Its a big change – it used to be almost a social contract that a company would invest in young people, even though its only after two or three years of apprenticeship and training that they start to add value, he added. The scale of the change and its impact on jobs are hotly debated. Experts at the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP) warn against sweeping predictions like the imminent loss of 100 million jobs, nearly half the US workforce. The non-partisan US think-tank and private foundation focused on technology and security was founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt in 2021. I would be very cautious about any predictions because we dont know the full scope of adoption or the rate of change. Whats also not really accounted for is how jobs can change in place versus automation away from jobs, said Mr Martijn Rasser, SCSPs senior director for economy. For example, youll still need accountants, but whataccountantsdo will change, he said. Dr Ryan Carpenter, a special adviser focusing on workforce issues at SCSP, said some uncertaintieshaveto be faced. Its like what we saw with the internet boom 25 years ago. Did certain jobs go away? Yes, thats every time theres broad technological adoption. So, we wont have nearly as many coders 20 years from now as we do today. But that does not mean these people will be unemployed for the rest of their lives; its a matter of reskilling. The bigger challenge is that the timeline for this transformation will probably be shorter than what we experienced, for example, in the industrial revolution. Thats probably whats causing more anxiety, Dr Carpenter added. But there would be a net jobs gain over time, he said. Where I see a particular opportunity is in manufacturing – because its a bipartisan priority for America to make things again. We dont have the workforce to be able to execute that now, so that will require new people moving into the manufacturing space. For widespread adoption of robotics, well need technicians able to work alongside these robots, to reprogram them, maintain them. Lawmakers, often criticised for being slow in regulating transformative tech, are trying to get a handle on the challenge. A new Bill introduced in the US Senate in October 2025 is seeking to compel companies to report to the government every quarter how many jobs were displaced due to AI, how many people were hired for AI jobs and how many retrained. Mr Yin said the government could alsolean into ensure that the education system produces AI natives. The Trump administrations AI Action Plan has made a start by roping in tech majors like Google and IBM to develop and support AI literacy programmes in schools and teacher training. The silver lining in these times, Mr Yin said, is that it is much easier to start companies now, using resources like cloud computing. These deliver on-demand computing services – like servers, storage and databases – without the need to own physical infrastructure. AI could enable solopreneurs and make it possible to service niche markets, he said. In the past, it didnt really make sense to build a tech app just for the Singapore market. But now, Ive been telling some Singaporean founders that its possible to create a lot more Singapore-only opportunities. Its not always jobs, but there are more opportunities, he said. A one-man shop, for instance, could create a mini app to order hawker food. You could charge a thousand people $5 a month, lets say, and youd be making $5,000 monthly.",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/as-ai-adoption-rises-job-fears-grow-across-the-united-states

Ultra-Orthodox seminary students have long been exempt from mandatory military service. Many Israelis criticize what they see as an unfair burden carried by the majority who serve. The ultra-Orthodox resistance to joining the military is based on their strong sense of religious identity, which religious leaders say they fear risks being weakened by army service.

Ludovic Marin/Pool via REUTERS","['United States', 'Ukraine']","PARIS, Jan 6 - The United States and European nations on Tuesday closed in on a set of legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine designed to shield it from further Russian aggression once an eventual peace deal is brokered. Here are key comments made after a meeting in Paris: STEVE WITKOFF, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY The president strongly stands behind security protocols. Those security protocols are meant to a) deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and b) if there are any attacks, theyre meant to defend, and they will do both. They are as strong as anyone has ever seen. Everyone on this panel on this stage up here has acknowledged that. We think were largely finished with security protocols, which are important so that the people of Ukraine know that when this ends, it ends forever. But we also think, critically, that we are very, very close to finishing up as robust a prosperity agreement as any country has ever seen coming out of conflicts like this. JARED KUSHNER, U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPS SON-IN-LAW I think today was a very, very big milestone. This does not mean that we will make peace, but peace would not be possible without the progress that was made here today... If Ukraine is going to make a final deal, they have to know that after a deal they are secure, they have, obviously, a robust deterrence, and theres real backstops to make sure that this will not happen again. KEIR STARMER, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER The signing of the declaration paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraines skies and seas and regenerating Ukraines armed forces for the future. I can say that following the ceasefire, the UK and France will establish military hubs across Ukraine and build protected facilities for weapons and military equipment to support Ukraines defensive needs. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT These security guarantees are key to ensuring that a peace agreement can never amount to a Ukrainian surrender, and that a peace agreement can never result in a new threat to Ukraine. We all want ... peace (in Ukraine) to be fair, lasting and clear-eyed ... we want this peace to have its guarantees. He later told France 2 TV: Weve expressed our availability to be deployed in this multinational force. These are not combat forces, I want to clarify that for our fellow countrymen. Its for the day after theres peace, offering a guarantee of peace and security. Thats potentially thousands of men. But its not, first of all, for right now. Second of all, it will be part of a plan. And finally it will be part of our existing foreign operations. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT It has been determined which countries are ready to take the lead in ensuring security on land, in the air, at sea, and in reconstruction. It has been determined what kind of forces are necessary. It has been determined how the forces will be managed and at what levels of command. We had very substantive discussions with the American team regarding monitoring to ensure that there are no violations of the peace. America is ready to work on this. We believe that documents on security guarantees are ready – bilateral, Ukraine-US, as well as trilateral documents. We expect that they may be signed in the near future. FRIEDRICH MERZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR Every partner in the coalition must, under its own domestic procedures, decide in due course what contribution it will make... Germany will continue to contribute politically, financially, and militarily. On the type and scope of a German contribution, the government and the German Bundestag must and will decide once the conditions (of the ceasefire) are clarified. That could include, for example, after a ceasefire, deploying forces for Ukraine on neighboring NATO territory. We basically rule nothing out. DONALD TUSK, POLISH PRIME MINISTER We all want to take advantage of this moment when Ukraine and all the countries that participated in this meeting today are demonstrating some good will.

REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt","['Donald Trump', 'Police']","WASHINGTON, Jan 6 - Five years after the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Democrats in Congress accused Republicans of a whitewash of history while President Donald Trump delivered an upbeat speech to Republican lawmakers that made little mention of the riot by his supporters. The contrasting events laid bare the balance of power in Washington. Democrats sought to revive memories of the attack, in which thousands of Trump supporters sent lawmakers scrambling for their lives in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Trump, meanwhile, delivered jokes and danced to his signature song, YMCA, at an iconic performing arts venue in Washington named for former President John F. Kennedy, which his administration has now renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center. In an 82-minute speech to House Republicans, he briefly mentioned the riot, criticizing a congressional investigation and news coverage of the attack. Trumps White House unveiled a website that blamed Capitol Police for turning a peaceful demonstration into chaos. Later on Tuesday, roughly 150 Trump supporters traded insults with counterprotesters as they marched to the Capitol, where they sang the national anthem and other songs to commemorate the event. The march was organized by Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group who was sentenced to 24 years in prison after being found guilty of helping to plan the attack. Tarrio was one of more than 1,500 January 6 participants who were pardoned by Trump when he returned to the White House last year. Trump faced broad bipartisan criticism following the January 6 attack and the House impeached him for a second time, though the Republican-controlled Senate failed to convict him. Trump also faced a federal criminal prosecution, which was derailed by the Supreme Court. The attack came after months of baseless claims by Trump that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Roughly 140 police officers were injured and four people died during the attack, including a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. One police officer, who was attacked by protesters, died the following day. Four other police officers subsequently died by suicide. Democrats warned that the threats to election integrity and the rule of law posed by Trump have not receded. Donald Trump and far-right extremists in Congress have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and whitewash the horrific events of January 6. We will not let that happen, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a forum to mark the anniversary of the attack. The Trump administration has sought states voter registration lists, leading to fears the information could be misused. Trump has urged states to abandon mail-in ballots and has hinted at running for a third presidential term in 2028, which would violate the U.S. Constitution. Trump warned that Democrats could impeach him for a third time if they win control of the House in the November congressional elections. Some Republicans blamed far-left activists for the attack, without any evidence, and party lawmakers set up a new committee to uncover the full truth from that day. True accountability requires focusing on facts, not selective storytelling for partisan gain, the chairman of the subcommittee, Barry Loudermilk, said ahead of the Democrats hearing. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a leader of the impeachment effort and the subsequent investigation into the attack, accused Republicans of doing exactly nothing to mark its fifth anniversary.

I said, But I did become president. The First Lady was not present at the event. Mr Trump often breaks out his signature moves at the end of his speeches as the song YMCA plays over the loudspeakers, extending his arms in a herky-jerky way while the rest of his body remains stiff.

She actually said, Could you imagine FDR dancing? She said that to me. I said theres a long history that perhaps she doesnt know, because he was an elegant fellow, even as a Democrat, Mr Trump said. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, known as FDR, was paralysed from the waist down due to polio but rarely photographed in a wheelchair while president. Mr Trump said the First Lady also did not like how he sometimes pretends to lift weights during his speeches to dramatise his efforts to prevent transgender people from competing in womens weightlifting competitions. The weightlifting is terrible, he quoted her as saying. The First Ladys press secretary did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Undeterred, Mr Trump repeated the weightlifting anecdote on Jan 6. And when his speech was over, he did a quick dance before exiting the stage.

US backs security guarantees for Ukraine at summit of Kyivs allies in Paris,"Jan 07, 2026, 04:11 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 04:44 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/09881708b00b9b73521a30b2fd327d1a9d95ae44311318f11ce19f57026f0060,"At the Coalition summit are (from left) German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US envoy Jared Kushner (just seen).PHOTO: EPA","['Ukraine', 'United States', 'France', 'Germany', 'Britain']","PARIS - The United States for the first time on Jan 6 backed a broad coalition of Ukraines allies in vowing to provide security guarantees that leaders said would include binding commitments to support the country if it is attacked by Russia again. The pledge came at a summit in Paris of the coalition of the willing of mainly European nations to firm up security guarantees to reassure Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, which invaded its neighbour in 2014 and again at full scale in 2022. US special envoy Steve Witkoff said after the summit that President Donald Trump strongly stands behind security protocols. Those security protocols are meant to... deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and... if there are any attacks, theyre meant to defend, and they will do both. They are as strong as anyone has ever seen. A statement by coalition leaders also said that allies will participate in a proposed US-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism. Talks to bring the almost four-year conflict to an end have accelerated since November. However, Moscow has yet to signal willingness to make concessions after Kyiv pushed for changes to a US proposal that initially backed Russias main demands. The text approved by the coalition on Jan 6 underscores how discussions on security guarantees have advanced in recent weeks, even though Moscow has given no public sign that it would accept such arrangements. Until recently, much of the focus was on pledges of military aid for Ukraines forces and possible contributions to an international reassurance force. But attention has now shifted to legally binding guarantees to come to Kyivs aid in the event of another attack by Moscow. The possibility of a military response is likely to trigger debate in many European countries, diplomats say. These commitments may include the use of military capabilities, intelligence and logistical support, diplomatic initiatives, adoption of additional sanctions, the leaders statement said, adding that they would now finalise binding commitments. We all want... peace (in Ukraine) to be fair, lasting and clear-eyed… we want this peace to have its guarantees, French President Emmanuel Macron told a news conference after the summit. European leaders present at the meeting, including Mr Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stressed that the statement showed renewed unity between Europe and the US on helping Ukraine. The leaders statement also pledged a European-led Multinational Force for Ukraine... to support the rebuilding of Ukraines armed forces and support deterrence with the proposed support of the US. Kyiv has long said it cannot be safe without guarantees that are comparable to the NATO alliances mutual defence agreement, to deter Russia from attacking again.

The 70-year-old right-wing leader fell while sleeping and hit his head on a piece of furniture, his wife Michelle Bolsonaro wrote on Instagram earlier in the day. Brazils federal police said in a statement that Bolsonaro received initial medical treatment on Tuesday morning, adding that a federal police doctor found minor injuries and saw no need for hospitalization. Any referral to a hospital depends on authorization from the Supreme Court, it added. Citing the police report, Moraes said in his decision that there is no need for Bolsonaro to be immediately taken to hospital. Moraes said that the defense has the right to request exams for Bolsonaro, but that lawyers must schedule them in advance and provide information justifying the procedures. The Supreme Court Justice also asked Bolsonaros legal defense to specify which exams the ex-president wants to take so the court can verify if the prison system can conduct them. Bolsonaro underwent a series of medical procedures in December to treat a hernia and hiccups. He was discharged from hospital on January 1 and taken back to the Federal Police Superintendency in Brasilia, where he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after losing the 2022 presidential election. The former president was stabbed in the abdomen during a 2018 campaign event and has a history of hospitalizations and surgeries related to the attack.

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth is a frequent critic of so-called woke policies – by companies, at universities, and in the military – that attempt to increase opportunities for minorities, and expressed opposition to women serving in combat before taking office. The review is being undertaken by the non-profit Institute for Defence Analyses (IDA) to ensure standards are met and the United States maintains the most lethal military, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in a statement. Our standards for combat arms positions will be elite, uniform, and sex neutral because the weight of a rucksack or a human being doesnt care if youre a man or a woman, Mr Wilson said, adding that the Pentagon will not compromise standards to satisfy quotas or an ideological agenda. US broadcaster NPR – which obtained a Pentagon memo on the review – reported that it would take six months and said Army and Marine Corps leaders were asked to provide data to the IDA, including on unit readiness, training and performance. Before his nomination to be defense secretary, Mr Hegseth said during an episode of the Shawn Ryan Show podcast that he was opposed to women serving in combat roles, though not their presence in the armed forces as a whole. But he sought to move away from those remarks in his Senate confirmation hearing in early 2025, telling lawmakers that women will have access to ground combat roles... given the standards remain high. In March, Mr Hegseth ordered the military to develop gender-neutral physical fitness standards for front-line troops, but did not raise the possibility of excluding women from combat roles.

Forum: Bring down CIQ costs for pleasure craft owners in Singapore,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:37 AM",,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'Travel and leisure', 'Singapore Customs']","I wish to highlight the high cost faced by owners of pleasure craft (boats used for sport, recreational or leisure purposes) when leaving and entering Singapore, and to urge the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to consider a more practical and affordable alternative. Pleasure craft can clear Customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) only at a few designated private marinas. These marinas typically charge about $300 per clearance, purportedly to cover armed guards and the maintenance of CIQ working space. Pleasure craft owners must also engage a licensed agent at a cost of about $200 per clearance, unless they furnish a bank bond of $5,000 to ICA to act as their own agent. As a result, a single outbound clearance costs about $500, and a simple weekend round trip to nearby destinations such as Batam or Bintan can cost up to $1,000 in clearance fees. This is prohibitively expensive. Countries such as Indonesia and Thailand allow pleasure craft owners to complete CIQ procedures themselves, without engaging agents or renting private marina facilities, at costs amounting to only tens of Singapore dollars. While ICA can conduct CIQ procedures at Marina South Pier (MSP), MPA does not permit pleasure craft to berth there for CIQ purposes, even though cruise ships are allowed to do so. Instead, pleasure craft owners who want to save on marina CIQ charges are required to charter water launches from private marinas to MSP, adding several hundred dollars to the process and nullifying the intended savings. I suggest MPA consider allowing pleasure craft to berth at MSP for CIQ purposes, and that ICA let pleasure craft owners submit CIQ documentation directly without requiring a large bank bond. This would remove the need for costly third-party agents and marina fees. Such changes would promote maritime tourism and benefit Singapore pleasure craft owners as well as visiting boats, and would bring Singapores CIQ practices in line with those of most other maritime nations.

Forum: Concerned over synchronised fee hikes at driving centres,"Jan 07, 2026, 05:00 AM",,,,"['Today\'s Letters', 'CCCS/Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore', 'Competition laws', 'Cars']","The decision by the three driving centres in Singapore – ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, Bukit Batok Driving Centre and Singapore Safety Driving Centre – to raise fees from Jan 1 for practical lessons, theory classes and simulator training bears the hallmarks of cartel-like behaviour that penalises consumers (Driving centres in Singapore hike learner fees in 2026, Jan 4). The fee hikes, ranging from 6.8 per cent to over 25.2 per cent for specific modules, are being implemented at a time when learners are already struggling with a bottlenecked system. The demand for learning slots now far outstrips supply. This chronic imbalance has created a market where driving centres have zero incentive to improve productivity or streamline operations. Instead, they operate in a sellers market where learners have no choice but to pay whatever is demanded just to secure a slot. When all players in a limited market raise prices at the same time, it suggests a lack of genuine competition. In a healthy, competitive landscape, at least one provider would maintain or lower prices to capture the massive overflow of demand. Instead, we see a coordinated upward trend that suggests the centres are comfortable increasing fees with impunity, knowing that their customer base is captive and desperate. The justifications provided – such as rising operational costs and instructor wages – must be scrutinised. If productivity is not being enhanced to offset these costs, the burden is simply shifted to the young Singaporeans and workers for whom a driving licence is a vital asset for employment. I urge the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singaporeto investigate the fee structures. We need to ensure that the price adjustments are a result of market forces and not a lack of competitive spirit among the only three providers in the country.

Fernandez from AWARE for raising the important issue of access to the employment dispute resolution process at the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) (Taking employers to task for discrimination: How easy is the legal process?, Dec 29). Transient Workers Count Too has, over the years, assisted many low-wage migrant workers throughout the ECT process –from initial filing to final resolution – pursuing salary and wrongful dismissal claims. As the article notes, the ECT process can be complex and intimidating, especially for migrant workers who lack community support or face language and cultural barriers. We also wish to highlight the increasing length of the ECT process. In early 2024, the typical interval between claim registration and the first case management conference was about three weeks. In 2025, this doubled to six weeks. We have also seen hearings involving Burmese-speaking employees postponed by a month due to interpreter shortages. These delays prolong stress and defer resolution, often worsening employees financial and emotional hardship. We hope the relevant authorities give due attention to these resourcing and scheduling challenges so the ECT process remains timely, accessible and fair, particularly for those already structurally disadvantaged. We also support the articles call to broaden support for employees navigating the ECT process in anticipation of its jurisdiction expansion under the Workplace Fairness Act and the Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Act, highlighting where the ECT and the authorities can improve accessibility and address power imbalances. One practical example is the Community Courts and Tribunals (CCT) Friend Scheme. With tribunal approval, an employee may be accompanied by a CCT Friend who provides emotional and administrative support. Most employees are unaware of this option until we advise them. While CCT Friends cannot advocate for employees, they help explain instructions, take notes and locate documents. Our experience shows that this support empowers employees to participate fully in the process, leading to more equitable outcomes. We support efforts to encourage more organisations to provide such assistance on a pro bono basis, and strongly urge that vulnerable employees be referred to appropriate organisations early in the process.

Stock quickly sold out on the website of its US distributor, providing the latest example ofwhat has become known as Swiftonomics– the ability of the 36-year-old billionaire to make or break brands with an endorsement. It is pretty mad. You cannot put a price on it, Mr Laurent Saget, who runs Terres Blanches, told AFP. Even if we had wanted to place one of our bottles in such a widely watched series, we could not have afforded it. It is nice to have a spotlight land on the appellation and on our domaine, he added. Mr Saget, 40, said he did not know Swifts music, but he would be happy to welcome the soon-to-be-married megastar to the small family-owned property in the village of Bue, which produces 80,000 to 120,000 bottles a year. Swift is known to be a wine fan, referencing the drink frequently in her lyrics as well as in photos posted to social media. When asked in 2018 by American talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres what she would bring to a dinner party, she showed no hesitation in replying white wine, before adding her preferences: Sancerre, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc. Sancerre is one of Frances most famous wine-making regions, located in the central Loire Valley, where its famously crisp whites are produced from 100 per cent Sauvignon Blanc and its reds with Pinot Noir. It has steadily built a following in the US, earning a reputation as a quintessential quality French white alongside others from Burgundy. Its popularity abroad means that around two out of three bottles of white Sancerre produced each year are exported, with about half crossing the Atlantic to the US, according to industry figures. New tariffs of 15 per cent imposed on French wine by US President Donald Trump are not expected to hit demand, said Mr Saget. Despite the tariffs, and perhaps not everyone would say the same way, but I do not think there has been a major impact on our appellation, he said, adding that Sancerre was positioned as a pricey but still accessible product. Other famous Sancerre fans include American basketball star LeBron James and Spanish singer Rosalia. Its fortunes differ sharply with Frances wine industry as a whole, which is struggling with overproduction, fierce competition internationally and declining domestic consumption. Even in some of the best-known regions such as Bordeaux, low-end producers are ripping up vines to plant other crops, including olives.

In a video uploaded to Instagram on Jan 2, the 46-year-old said: Its late on Jan 1. The first day of 2026. And Im entering into this new year, the Year of the Horse, with some bad news about my concussion. The actress, who played superhero scientist Hope van Dyne/Wasp in the Ant-Man superhero film trilogy (2015 to 2023) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), said she received results back from her brain scans and almost every area in my brain is functioning at a decreased capacity. So, I do have brain damage from the TBI (traumatic brain injury), and possibly other factors going on, she added. Now, my job is to get to the bottom of that with the doctors and then embark on the hard work of fixing it, which I dont look forward to because I feel like hard work is all I do. But thats okay. My cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finish to my 2025. Feeling extraordinarily grateful and blessed to be able to play one more day, one more year on this beautiful living planet, she said before thanking her followers for caring. Lilly, who has two children aged 14 and 10 with her production assistant partner Norman Kali, first revealed her injury in a blog post on digital publishing platform Substack in May 2025. Posting photos of her bloodied face, she explained how she had experienced fainting spells since she was a child, with doctors initially believing it was due to hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which was later ruled out. The star, who is also known for her roles in TV series Lost (2004 to 2010) and The Hobbit films (2013 to 2014), updated in an Instagram post in June 2025 that her concussion took a downturn. Several of Lillys celebrity friends, including her Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania (2023) co-star Michelle Pfeiffer, commented in Lillys recent Instagram post. You are a warrior. Nothing – not even this will defeat you my friend, wrote the 67-year-old American actress, adding a heart emoji. Thanks, Mama, replied Lilly, who played Pfeiffers onscreen daughter in the Marvel franchise.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/ant-man-actress-evangeline-lilly-reveals-she-has-brain-damage-after-hitting-her-head-on-rock

"For a Gen X music geek, closing MTVs music video channels marks the end of a chapter","Jan 06, 2026, 12:45 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:54 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/dfe5c34916a54039a61928bb1eaedac95f631437efc556d667638367d2296562,"MTV VJs (from left) Nadya Hutagalung, Jamie Aditya, Sarah Sechan, Mike Kasem and Sonia Couling.PHOTO: MTV","['Music', 'Television', 'Streaming - music/video/content']","SINGAPORE – As a Gen X music fan whose formative years came before the internet became ubiquitous, MTVs arrival in Singapore in the early 1990s was a pop-culture milestone. Suddenly, all those music videos by bands such as American rock groups Nirvana and R.E.M. that I had only read about in magazines and newspapers were right there on my living rooms television screen. My first proper introduction to the American channel was in 1992, when the then Singapore Broadcasting Corporations Channel 5 started airing two MTV programmes – MTVs Most Wanted and MTV Top Asian Top 20 – past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. Technically, it was not the real deal. MTVs 24/7 music video channel would make its official debut in Singapore on cable television only in 1995. Still, it was a watershed moment for music geeks like me. I would stay up late, one finger hovering over the record button on the VCR remote, ready to commit my favourite bands to tape so I could watch them again and again and again. So, when I read about howMTV officially ended its music video channels worldwide on Dec 31after 44 years – the brand itself is still around through its reality television and digital content – it felt like the end of a defining cultural run. But it also came as no surprise, as the channel had long ceased to be the primary vehicle for music videos. And honestly, who would want to sit in front of the television set waiting for ones favourite bands to come on, when music videos can now be watched on YouTube any time and anywhere? In an age of viral short-form videos on TikTok and Reels, snappy public conversations on X and Threads, and never-ending live streams, music videos do not have as much hold on mainstream pop culture as they did decades ago. That being said, the MTV brand will always hold a dear place in my heart. Watching the channel was a shared experience for a generation that grew up in a time when music discovery was a slow and communal experience. While the primary music listening experiences were audio-only mediums like cassettes, CDs and the radio, MTV played a big part in how genres – be it grunge, Britpop, hip-hop or pop – were enjoyed visually. From the cinematic drama of Guns N Roses November Rain (1992) and the raw, visceral energy of Nirvanas Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) to Michael and Janet Jacksons science-fiction epic Scream (1995) and Jamiroquais mind-bending Virtual Insanity (1996), watching a series of music videos on MTV back then felt like you were connected to the global youth culture. The VJs, or video jockeys, who hosted the local and regional MTV shows – such as Nadya Hutagalung, Jamie Aditya and Mike Kasem – became household names themselves. Starting in the late 1990s, MTVs presence went far beyond the television screen in Singapore, as the city-state was also MTV Asias operational base. In 2002, the inaugural MTV Asia Awards took place at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. While it was not populated with A-listers like the annual US-based MTV Video Music Awards, it did feature stars like American pop singer Pink, Irish boy band Westlife and J-pop queen Ayumi Hamasaki. The 2003 and 2004 editions were also held in Singapore, boasting global acts such as Mariah Carey and Linkin Park, as well as home-grown darling Stefanie Sun and Taiwans Jay Chou. Ironically, that was around the same time MTV in the US started to pivot away from music videos to focus more on wildly popular reality television shows such as Jackass (2000 to 2002), The Osbournes (2002 to 2005) and Pimp My Ride (2004 to 2007). In 2010, the channel officially dropped the words music television from its logo, marking the complete transition to a broader entertainment network focused on reality shows and pop culture. Closer to home, after years of reduced original programming, the main MTV Asia channel finally made its exit after StarHub TV discontinued it in 2022. The final music video that played when MTV pulled the plug on its music video channels on New Years Eve was The Buggles Video Killed The Radio Star (1979) – the same one used for the launch in 1981. A song about one medium replacing another, it reads more like a reminder that every innovation in how people consume music must eventually give way to something more contemporary.",https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/viewpoint-for-a-gen-x-music-geek-closing-mtvs-music-video-channels-marks-the-end-of-a-chapter

From sculpted lipsticks that look like art pieces to glassy lip tints that sell out overnight, C-Beauty is having a serious moment. What does C-Beauty mean? The rise of C-beauty How does C-Beauty differ from K-Beauty or J-Beauty? How do you know if the C-Beauty product is safe and authentic? What are popular C-Beauty brands? C-Beauty - short for Chinese beauty - refers to cosmetics and skincare brands born in China that blend cultural heritage, innovative formulas, and striking visual design. Merging cutting-edge technology with storytelling rooted in Chinese art, mythology, and modern aesthetics, the result is an emerging beauty identity thats proudly original, expressive, and globally relevant. In the past few years, Chinese makeup brands have exploded on social media, captivating users with collectible packaging, new-gen textures, and clever formulations. FromFlorasiss intricately carved lipsticks toInto Yous viral lip muds, these C-Beauty labels capture the spirit of modern Chinese creativity - sophisticated yet accessible, luxurious yet experimental. Singapores beauty scene has quickly caught on, with many of these cult names now available through local retailers, e-commerce platforms, and even physical stores. While K-Beauty (Korean beauty) popularised dewy, glass-skin minimalism and J-Beauty (Japanese beauty) built its reputation on purity and precision, C-Beauty stands out for its artistry, cultural depth, and storytelling. If youre wondering what is the difference between K-Beauty and C-Beauty, here is how you can tell them apart. K-Beautys strength lies in innovation and routine-driven skincare, while J-Beauty focuses on refined textures and long-term care. In contrast, C-Beauty places strong emphasis on design, symbolism, and mood - makeup as an art form rather than a utility. Youll find influences from ancient Chinese paintings, poetry, and architecture translated into packaging and colour stories. Where Korean and Japanese beauty brands tend to champion subtlety, Chinese makeup brands arent afraid of maximalism. Many C-Beauty brands thrive on bold palettes, ornate compacts, and a sense of narrative. The rise of C-Beauty has, inevitably, come with growing pains. Counterfeit products and unregulated sellers occasionally surface online, especially through third-party marketplaces. The good news: Chinas beauty manufacturing standards have improved significantly over the past decade. Now, many Chinese makeup brands operate under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certifications and are subject to stricter oversight under Chinas Cosmetic Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR) implemented in 2021. Still, vigilance is key. Heres how to shop C-Beauty products safely in Singapore: Buy from official stores or verified platforms.Stick to official Shopee Mall, LazMall, or dedicated brand sites likeJoocyee SingaporeorPerfect Diarys Official Store. Check packaging details and batch codes.Authentic C-Beauty products usually include brand-verified seals or serial numbers you can cross-check online. Avoid prices that seem too good to be true.Counterfeits often undercut by large margins. Read reviews and ingredient lists.Many top C-Beauty brands now provide full INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) listings and safety documentation in English. When in doubt, purchase from authorised local retailers such asWatsons, Guardian, or beauty specialty stores that list their partnerships directly on brand websites.

He ended up studying materials science and engineering in university, but it was his side hustle – watering, growing and selling plants – that held the most attraction. It turned out to be the best thing he did despite growing opportunities in other fields, and Mr Yap kept at it. Today, he manages his farm, Noi Gardens, in Singapore full time, and recently expanded to Johor Bahru, developing operations there. He has about 18 employees in both places. Mr Yap is among a growing number of younger workers, especially millennials and Gen Zs, who not only find a hands-on career rewarding, but are also enticed by the tangible fruits that come from entrepreneurship. Observers told The Straits Times that the growing interest in traditional skilled trades such as landscaping and plumbing can be attributed to younger workers hoping to become their own boss one day, with some considering it at least a part-time career. Licensed plumber Geraldine Goh, 31, who started her own plumbing business, Agraffe, in 2017 after a stint as a facilities management officer at a town council, said she has noticed a shift where younger people are attempting to enter the industry. Mr Shameer Khan, 22, said he joined BCA Academys plumbing and pipe-fitting course to widen his skills and expand his interior renovation companys service offerings. I chose plumbing over carpentry due to its wide coverage, including sewage systems, fire protection and water installation. Another student from the course, Mr Yeo Kai Xun, 23, wanted to leverage his architecture knowledge but hoped to pursue his passion for fixing things by obtaining a plumbing licence, building a practical, hands-on career in the built environment sector. Ms Goh, who is also a certified trainer running the basic domestic plumbing course at property management company Exceltec, said she envisions herself sharing her work experience with her juniors. Many experienced plumbers with decades of hands-on knowledge are retiring. If younger people dont step in to learn these skills now, we risk losing critical troubleshooting expertise that cant be replaced overnight. While there are project plumbers whose services are focused on large commercial projects, she is more passionate about maintenance work in peoples homes, including HDB, condominium and landed properties. Diagnosing real causes of issues like recurring leaks, concealed pipe failures, choked pipelines or poor water pressure requires deep understanding. Its the passion for helping others and solving problems, and whether you have the heart to help people. Mr Yap said of his experience: It was like this farming life chose me instead. Managing the business got him hooked, as he learnt new things daily, travelled to places like Thailand, Malaysia, Holland, Australia and Taiwan, and was able to see how people run their farms and sell produce in their own unique ways. Its almost like finding out the very things that make people happy across the world. When I started, I had to do all the watering and growing myself, and after a while, I set up systems in place to grow the plants. I am still working on improving the technical aspects of it, said Mr Yap, whose business focuses on wholesale and e-commerce. While he started out selling a lot of adeniums, commonly known as desert roses, and fruit plants, he kept changing the plants he sells – from succulents to ferns, caudex, aroids, bonsai and others. Mr Yap now has the whole range, offers landscaping services, and he recently started growing grass. Industry experts said that, in addition to passion, creating and being good at something tangible has resonated with people aged 25 to 44, the range covering millennials and Gen Zs. Its craftsmanship with a visible payoff, said Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) Institute chief executive Dominic Ng. Carpentry and woodworking are no longer perceived strictly as legal trades, but have been rediscovered as creative, resilient and future-ready skills, he said. The Artisan Academy of SFIC Institute has seen a clear and growing uptick in course participation from workers up to 35 years old, with many not only signing up for basic skills, but also pursuing advanced competencies to strengthen their career prospects. SFIC Institute business development manager Raymond Tuan, who oversees the professional craftsman programme, said there are mainly two groups of people who join the 21-day full-time course or its part-time variation. In the first group are those who are keen on home improvement, such as wanting to fix or repair their own cabinets, and in the second are people below 40 years old who are hoping to enter the gig economy or become their own boss one day. Those in the second group typically have full-time jobs and take up the course part-time after work or on weekends. Architecture graduate Shannon Tan, 26, said she joined the programme as craftsmanship is a growing industry. Its never boring. Compared with an office job, it might be better for young people to work with their hands and be on their feet while they still can, and it also helps young designers be creative. Dr Natt Srinara, a lecturer and consultant at EHL Hospitality Business School, said young people in the hospitality sector are noticing real vacancies and clear entry points in hotels, restaurants and attractions, especially for roles such as guest relations, kitchen, housekeeping, events and maintenance. This means the local hospitality and tourism sectors are still hiring, while many white-collar sectors are talking about headcount freezes, he noted. Besides, these jobs feel more resilient against artificial intelligence than a generic office role. Theres pride in craft, at being good at something tangible, whether thats plating desserts or receiving compliments from a high-net-worth guest, said Dr Srinara. Social media has also made these jobs more visible and aspirational, he said. Baristas, pastry chefs and horticulturists are showing their work online, and that changes how young people see trades. SFIC Institutes Mr Ng agreed, saying that social platforms such as TikTok spotlight the maker culture, where woodcraft becomes both a passion and a marketable product or service, enabling freelancers and boutique studios to thrive. Mr Yap uses social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Xiaohongshu to generate content and create new business opportunities. My content moved from memes to educational, to humour to care tips, to farm tours and more. And it seems people get better opportunities these days. Meanwhile, the local workforce in the lift and escalator industry is becoming younger and better paid, with a roughly 21 per cent increase in workers aged up to 35 from 2023 to 2025, said a spokesperson for the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). Over the past two years, the median age of local workers has also fallen, from 46 to 40 years old. Mr Muaaz Samat, 25, joined lift and escalator company Kone as a maintenance technician overseeing equipment operations at a hospital because it offered the perfect combination of hands-on engineering and career growth opportunities. Many people assume my job is like being a car mechanic. Its actually far more dynamic. One moment Im checking ropes, the next Im diagnosing error codes or fixing doors – all to keep passengers moving safely every day, he said. Mr Samat added that working in a hospital makes the job especially meaningful, as he gets to see how essential lifts are for patients. Nurses rely on them to move people who often have no other way to get around. Its humbling, and it reminds me why reliability matters. I was hospitalised once, too, so I understand how vulnerable these moments can feel. In 2023, theNational Trades Union Congress called for skilled trades to be professionalised, and started working with the Ministry of Manpower to develop a Career Progression Model with specific career and accreditation pathways. It also released a study that aims to establish a strong local core of skilled tradespeople in Singapore. The study showed that 57 per cent of respondents viewed skilled trade jobs with low status stigma. Another 57 per cent viewed them as jobs with low pay, while another 50 per cent cited the lack of career advancement opportunities. Despite signs of interest and openness among the youth towards skilled trades, analysts said the perception gap and stigma about such jobs still linger. Dr Issac Lim, founder of social science consultancy Anthro Insights, said these jobs are bounded by concerns around status, earnings, stability and job demands. The momentum is still fragile and unlikely to sustain unless two structural issues are addressed head-on: persistent stigma and the pay or career-value gap relative to degree pathways. Dr Srinara said: If rosters are brutal or pay progression is unclear, then no amount of funding or portals will convince a young person to stay. And theres still a perception gap, as many parents and teachers still see skilled trades as a fallback, not a first choice, unlike professional, managerial, executive and technical jobs. As part of ongoing efforts to create more opportunities for Singaporeans to succeed, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon had said in Parliament in September 2025 that the Government will work with employers, the labour movement, trade associations and institutes of higher learning todevelop pathways for progression for those inclined towards hands-on and heart jobs. He did not provide a specific timeline for this initiative. While government efforts like Graduate Industry Traineeships and Careers and Skills Passport have been set in place to help young people secure traineeships and transit into trade jobs, analysts said more can be done to shift public perception. (Such initiatives) work best when employers redesign roles to be more sustainable and aspirational, and when schools and career counsellors start talking about hospitality trades as serious, future-proof careers, and not as fallbacks for those not so academically inclined, said Dr Srinara. We have to show that skilled trades are not dead ends. Concrete examples of how a room attendant becomes a floor supervisor, then an assistant executive housekeeper and eventually manages multiple properties, make a huge difference to parents and to the youth themselves. Dr Lim, who also teaches organisational behaviour at NUS Business School, added that young people are unlikely on their own to shift the underlying incentives and perceptions that keep many young locals away from the trades. Meanwhile, SFIC Institute hopes to build an ecosystem for its students and aspiring craftsmen professionals to turn to for support. We can help to accelerate this ecosystem development by forging deeper partnerships between training providers and industry clusters, and elevate woodworking careers through storytelling campaigns and success journeys, said the institutes Mr Ng. Said Dr Lim: If the goal is to grow local participation in 2026, the core test is simple: Can a tradesperson reliably achieve a decent middle-class living and social respect as a first-choice vocation?",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/farmer-plumber-lift-technician-more-young-people-in-singapore-drawn-to-skilled-trades

The STI gained 1.27 per cent or 59.47 points to finish at 4,739.97, after 1.71 billion securities worth $1.78 billion changed hands. OCBC Bank crossed $20 for the first time, closing at a new high of $20.18, while DBS jumped to a fresh high of $57.93. Investors cannot afford to ignore the Singapore stock market, said Ms Carmen Lee, head of equity research at OCBC Group Research, at OCBCs annual Premier Private Client Investment Seminar at the Ritz-Carlton on Jan 6. The STI outperformed the US S&P 500 in 2025 and closed the year up 22.7 per cent, after notching new highs for eight consecutive months, she noted in a Jan 5 research note. The last time this happened was in 2006-2007. Local stocks got a big boost from regulatory initiatives such as the Equity Market Development Programme (EQDP), which pooled $5 billion with selected fund managers to invest in locally listed companies. The second and latest batch of six asset managers has been appointed to oversee $2.85 billion under the EQDP, bringing the total allocation to $3.95 billion so far, with $1.05 billion still to be deployed. A lot of regional investors are in Singapore stocks. A number of small- and mid-cap stocks did exceptionally well (in 2025), and there will be more focus on this space in 2026, Ms Lee said. She added that the STI could rise further as valuations improve in 2026. (Local) banks will still see a good year. In the last two years, banks were driven by interest income. But in 2026 and 2027, capital market activity or new IPOs could provide a second wind. Despite market volatility, financial stocks closed 2025 with an average gain of 20.7 per cent, as banks surprised the market with stronger-than-expected earnings, Ms Lee said in her Jan 5 research note. The outlook for 2026 suggests that bank earnings should remain steady even as lending margins narrow, supported by strong growth in wealth management activity and healthy returns, she said. Bull markets usually last five to six years, with the market currently in its third year of the cycle, said Mr Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC. Even as concerns remain over inflation, tariff uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and the US Federal Reserves independence under the Trump administration, Mr Menon believes that the outlook is still benign and market pullbacks are opportunities to buy. On the impact of higher US tariffs, OCBC chief economist Selena Ling said the US bark has been worse than its bite. Despite the lingering threat of US semiconductor tariffs and pharmaceutical tariffs, she noted: We are not at risk of recession, but we will see a slowdown in many ASEAN countries including Singapore in 2026, mainly because the base growth was so high in 2025. Singapores manufacturing surged in the final quarter of 2025, driven by demand for artificial intelligence-related semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, which helped the economy achieve better-than-expected full-year growth of 4.8 per cent. Things could hold up if the AI boom continues, finance and insurance (sectors) continue to do well, and (tourists and MICE) visitors keep coming, she said. Local brokerage house UOB Kay Hian is also bullish on its outlook for Singapore stocks, citing continued tailwinds from the EQDP and a return to earnings growth for many local stocks. Following first-half results and third-quarter business updates in 2025, most companies saw upgrades to earnings expectations, and this momentum is likely to continue into 2026. On the back of this earnings growth, we forecast a year-end target of 5,000 for the STI in 2026, UOB Kay Hian analyst Adrian Loh said in a Jan 2 research note. The property, land transport, healthcare and plantation sectors are expected to see double-digit percentage increases in earnings. In particular, the property sector, which comprises CapitaLand Investment and City Developments, could benefit from improving operating conditions and recurring income growth, a recovery in key markets, as well as macro environment tailwinds, Mr Loh said. The financial and telecommunications sectors are also expected to post 1.2 per cent and 9.6 per cent earnings growth, respectively, in 2026. Despite fears of net interest margin compression, the local banking sectors earnings held up extremely well in 2025 and should continue to be buoyed by the wealth management industry, while the telecommunications sector should benefit from stabilisation of core services and improved operator profitability, Mr Loh said. Given the prevalence of blue-chip defensive stocks with strong cash flow generation and relatively high dividend yields, the Singapore market will continue to attract fund flows, he added. Undergirding the local markets strength, the Singapore economy grew surprisingly well in 2025, due to stronger contributions from the manufacturing, commerce and finance sectors, UOB Kay Hian said. For 2026, UOB Global Economics and Markets Research forecasts gross domestic product growth of 2.1 per cent, which is at the higher end of the Ministry of Trade and Industrys forecast of 1 per cent to 3 per cent.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/sti-hits-new-record-high-of-over-4700-points-may-reach-5000-in-2026
Singdollar could continue to strengthen against regional currencies in 2026: OCBC chief economist,"Jan 06, 2026, 04:54 PM","Jan 07, 2026, 05:46 AM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/7a654dc60c383f22bc641e32f9debf5e65f1dd3cd3c94cc2f5aa3e98381ae407,"Chief economist Selena Ling noted that The Republic is in a sweet spot in 2026, given strong economic growth, resilient domestic demand and a stable monetary environment.PHOTO: OCBC","['Banks and financial institutions', 'Singapore economy', 'Currencies']","SINGAPORE - The Singapore dollar could continue to appreciate modestly against regional currencies in 2026, which is a good sign for Singaporeans looking to travel overseas. Speaking at an investment seminar for OCBCs private clients on Jan 6, the banks chief economist Selena Ling said the low inflation seen in 2025 may creep up slightly in 2026, but there is no urgency for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to change its policy stance of allowing the Singdollar to gently appreciate. Its very likely they will keep it unchanged. That means that the slope of the S$NEER is going to be slightly positive, she said, referring to the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate. The Singapore dollar will appreciate modestly against regional currencies, and its good news for all of you because that means that the Singdollar will strengthen against, whether it is Japanese yen or some other countries, she added. Ms Ling noted that the Republic is in a sweet spot in 2026, given strong economic growth, resilient domestic demand and a stable monetary environment. The Singapore economy expanded 4.8 per cent in 2025 – topping the Governments forecast of 4 per cent. It was the economys best performance since 2021s 9.8 per cent, when it bounced back from the pandemic-induced 2020 recession. Calling 2025 a stunning year of growth, Ms Ling noted that there is a chance the Singapore economy may even exceed 3 per cent growth in 2026. If the artificial intelligence boom continues, if we continue to see finance and insurance do well, if we continue to see visitor arrivals, we may have a slightly better than even chance of exceeding the upper end of the official forecast of 1 per cent to 3 per cent year on year, she said. She noted that ASEAN performed well amid US tariff uncertainties in 2025, even as the market predicted that the front-loading of exports in the first half of the year would result in a payback in the second half. The payback never happened. If anything, the second half was even stronger than the first half. The whole AI-related boom, data centre boom, has benefited a lot of countries. But I think, in general, we also saw that interest rates were coming down. Domestic consumption was relatively resilient, she said. However, many ASEAN countries, including Singapore, might see a slowdown in 2026 largely due to big surprises on the growth side in 2025, she added. In the US, OCBC expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least once in 2026. But whether there will be more than one cut this year or down the road, it depends on where inflation goes. The Fed is going to have a new chairman who is very likely to also be more dovish, she said. Mr Jerome Powells term as Fed chairmanis set to end in May. The US Federal Reserve cut rates three times in 2025 to a range of 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent while projecting one more cut for 2026 amid softening labour and persistent inflation. The rate cuts led the US dollar to underperform, said Ms Ling. In 2026, OCBC expects the US dollar to soften moderately. However, US policy uncertainties, as well as increasing US debt levels, could weigh on the US dollar, said Ms Ling. But if the Fed decides to pause rate cuts, it would give the US dollar some support, she noted, adding that the US dollar also tends to benefit whenever there is a big growth or geopolitical crisis. We have a very benign outlook. We dont think the US is really at risk of a recession this year. Within most of the major economies, we will see fairly stable growth.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/singdollar-could-continue-to-strengthen-against-regional-currencies-in-2026-ocbc-chief-economist

Investment banking fees rose 28.9 per cent in 2025 from a year agoto reach US$864.6 million (S$1.1 billion), the highest annual total since 2021, according to the London Stock Exchange Groups (LSEG) Deals Intelligence team. Advisory fees from completed M&A transactions amounted to US$265.1 million, up 55.3 per cent from 2024. Equity capital markets (ECM) underwriting fees more than doubled to US$210.9 million, the strongest showing since 2021. Debt capital markets fees also recorded a historic jump of 55.9 per cent to US$155.2 million, marking the highest level on record. By contrast, syndicated lending fees fell 24.1 per cent to US$233.4 million. Home-grown DBS Group retained its position as Singapores leading investment bank, generating US$72.9 million in fees to capture an 8.4 per cent market share of the total fee pool. Despite the robust fee performance, overall M&A activity involving Singapore slowed. The total value of deals reached US$70.4 billion in 2025, down 9.1 per cent from 2024. The number of announced transactions fell 22.1 per cent to a 10-year low. At least fifteen deals worth over US$1 billion were announced in 2025, with a combined value of US$27.8 billion, though activity tapered off towards the end of the year as only one mega-deal was unveiled in the fourth quarter. Deals targeting Singapore companies rose 8.4 per cent to US$26.9 billion, underpinned by foreign investor interest. Inbound M&A activity, where a foreign company buys a local one, jumped 16 per cent to US$19.2 billion. Domestic M&A activity slipped 6.7 per cent to US$7.8 billion. Outbound M&A, where a Singapore company targets a foreign one, fell 7.2 per cent to US$22.6 billion, the lowest level in a decade. From a sector perspective, energy and power was the most targeted industry, accounting for 17.4 per cent of the total deal value at US$12.2 billion, roughly double the level in 2024. Real estate ranked second with US$10.3 billion, down 4.2 per cent from 2024. High technology followed closely with US$9.8 billion, up 37.6 per cent from the preceding year. Swiss banking giant UBS topped the league table for M&A transactions involving Singapore, advising on deals worth US$8.3 billion and taking an 11.8 per cent market share. Singapores equity capital markets slowed in the final quarter of 2025, raising US$1.7 billion, a 33.2 per cent decline from the previous three months. Despite thelostmomentum in the fourth quarter, total ECM proceeds in 2025 reached US$7.4 billion, more than double the amount raised during 2024 and the best annual total since 2021. The number of issues also rose by 66.7 per cent compared to 2024. A total of 38 initial public offerings (IPOs) by Singaporean companies were issued in 2025, raising US$2.5 billion. Of these, 27 IPOs were listed offshore – two in Hong Kong and 25 in the United States– raising a combined US$662.1 million. Eleven issuers chose to list on the Singapore Exchange, generating US$1.9 billion in proceeds. Real estate players were the biggest contributors to ECM volumes, accounting for 42.7 per cent of proceeds, or US$3.2 billion, aided by capital raisings from listed real estate investment trusts. The high technology sector followed, securing a 33.2 per cent share worth US$2.5 billion, while healthcare issuers contributed 10.4 per cent of total proceeds. DBS Group secured the top spot in Singapores domestic equity and equity-linked underwriting league table for 2025, with US$983.6 million in related proceeds. Singapores debt capital markets staged a strong performance in 2025, with total bond issuance by local entities reaching US$41.3 billion.

Financial institutions dominated activity, capturing 64.8 per cent of the market and raising US$26.7 billion, a 47.5 per cent increase from 2024.

Samsung likely to flag 160% jump in Q4 profit as AI boom stokes chip prices,"Jan 06, 2026, 10:06 AM","Jan 06, 2026, 07:59 PM",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/af575bdcf08ca5b095d5a898144da8aafb67b1a0014a5a0d117df74b82e3ab16,"Chip prices have rocketed in recent months, as the industrys shift to AI-related chips has curbed production for traditional memory.PHOTO: REUTERS","['Samsung', 'Semiconductors', 'AI/artificial intelligence', 'Smartphones']","SEOUL-Samsung Electronics is expected to flag a 160 per cent jump in its fourth-quarter operating profit, spurred by a severe chip shortage that has sharply driven up memory prices as customers scramble to meet booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Semiconductor prices have rocketed in recent months, as the industrys shift to AI-related chips has curbed production for traditional memory, while demand has been surging for both conventional and advanced chips to train and run AI models. Samsung is likely to estimate an operating profit of 16.9 trillion won (S$14.9 billion) for the October to December period, according to LSEG SmartEstimate from 31 analysts. This compares with 6.49 trillion won from a year earlier, and would mark the highest quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2018, which was a record high of 17.6 trillion won. Some analysts have, in recent weeks, raised their estimates for Samsungs fourth-quarter operating profit to more than 20 trillion won on the back of stronger-than-expected prices of traditional chips. The worlds top memory chip maker is set to release its estimates for revenue and operating profit on Jan 8. Prices for a type of DDR5 DRAM chip jumped 314 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to data from market researcher TrendForce. It expects conventional DRAM contract prices to rise 55 per cent to 60 per cent in the current quarter, from the October to December period. As conventional DRAM prices continue to surge, Samsung – whose production capacity is largely concentrated in this segment – stands to gain relatively more from the current price upcycle, TrendForce analyst Avril Wu said. DRAM chips are used in servers, computers and smartphones to temporarily store data and help run programs and applications smoothly and swiftly. DDR5 DRAM, a conventional chip, is faster and more efficient than its predecessor. In December, Micron Technology forecast second-quarter adjusted profit at nearly double Wall Street estimates. Micron chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said he expects memory markets to remain tight past 2026, and that in the medium term, it expects to meet only half to two-thirds of demand from several key customers. Samsungs booming profit marks a dramatic turnaround, just over a year after CEO Jun Young-hyun apologised for the companys disappointing earnings and performance as it lagged its cross-town rival SK Hynix in supplying high-end chips to Nvidia, the dominant maker of AI processors. Samsung shares jumped 125 per cent in 2025, marking their biggest annual percentage gain in 26 years. On Jan 2, Mr Jun said Samsung customers have praised the competitive edge of its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, or HBM4, quoting them as saying Samsung is back, which helped extend a rally in Samsungs shares to record highs in recent sessions. He did not elaborate on those customers, but analysts said Samsung is making progress supplying chips to Nvidia, potentially gaining share against SK Hynix and Micron. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Jan 5 the companys next generation of chips is in full production. The Vera Rubin platform, which will incorporate HBM4 chips, is on track to arrive later in 2026, Nvidia said. Analysts said Samsungs operating profit is expected to more than double in 2026 to more than 100 trillion won, as the chip price rally would more than offset slowing profit for its mobile business. Mr Lee Min-hee, an analyst at BNK Investment & Securities, said he was wary of Samsungs valuations, as surging chip prices may sap demand for PCs and smartphones, and cited risks of a demand slowdown for AI data centres increasingly relying on debt to finance investments. While the global shortage of memory chips is a boon to Samsungs mainstay semiconductor business, soaring chip prices are squeezing margins in its smartphone division, its second-largest revenue source. As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact, Samsung co-CEO TM Roh, who oversees Samsungs mobile, TV and home appliance businesses, told Reuters, adding it is trying to minimise the impact, which looks inevitable.REUTERS",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/samsung-likely-to-flag-160-jump-in-q4-profit-as-ai-boom-stokes-chip-prices

This will raise the portfolio occupancy of the pure-play data centre real estate investment trust (Reit) to 98 per cent, up from 81 per cent, said the mainboard-listed Reit. The agreement for the 10.8MW facility is expected to generate about US$14.8 million (S$19 million) in annualised net property income, or US$13.3 million based on the Reits 90 per cent share of the property. This represents a 35 per cent increase over its previous net rent, the Reit manager said. The Reit previously reported a net property income of US$67.7 million for the nine months ended Sept 30. The agreement commences on Dec 1. From then, the annualised rent contribution from investment-grade customers will go up to 82 per cent, from 79 per cent. The total portfolio weighted average lease expiration will be extended to 5.7 years, from 4.7 years currently. Mr John Stewart, chief executive of Digital Core Reits manager, said in a media briefing that the deal excludes tenant improvements, brokers from either side, leasing commission, rent-free periods and break clauses. He pointed out that the tenant will bear all of the fit-out costs; the agreement also includes a 3 per cent annual rental escalation clause with a no-break option for the tenant over the 10-year term. Digital Core Reit will invest about US$40 million in capital expenditure for redevelopment, which adds 13 per cent to the facilitys sellable capacity to 10.8MW, he added. Describing the deal as a strategic reset, he noted that the Linton Hall facility would account for 10 per cent of the Reits revenue. The facility has been sitting vacant since the previous tenant moved out of the facility on June 30, he added. Responding to queries from The Business Times, Mr Stewart said that the Reit seeks to continue delivering organic growth, particularly through its two assets in Los Angeles, California. We have two co-location facilities in Los Angeles, where we have both some existing vacancy and some opportunity to replicate our model by densifying or investing in the facility and bringing on a little bit of additional sellable capacity, he said. Based on its portfolio summary, the weighted average occupancy of Digital Core Reits Los Angeles portfolio stood at 90.5 per cent as at Sept 30. However, the Reit is not ruling out inorganic growth through acquisitions. Mr Stewart pointed out that it has US$15 billion in its acquisition pipeline from its sponsor, Digital Realty. We certainly have opportunities to invest and acquire, generate inorganic growth through acquisitions, he said. The counter had announced a trading halt on Jan 2, before the announcement. Units of Digital Core Reit closed 1 US cent lower at 53.5 US cents on Jan 6,after rising 6.9 per cent to 54.5 US cents on Jan 5.THE BUSINESS TIMES",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/digital-core-reit-bags-10-year-lease-at-its-us-facility-portfolio-occupancy-rises-to-98-from-81

The flame began its journey across Italy from Rome a month ago and has been to the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, as well as the southern cities of Naples and Bari as part of a 12,000 kilometre (7,450 mile) journey that will end in Milans San Siro stadium on February 6. The relay on Tuesday took in the Formula One circuit in Imola, although its progress was slowed by snow that blanketed the Emilia-Romagna region. Teenage presenters from local broadcaster Radioimmaginaria, who helped to carry the torch across Bologna, dedicated their run to peers killed in a New Years Eve fire at the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana. Giovanni Tamburi, a 16-year-old from Bologna, was one of those who died in the blaze. The relay has been part of efforts to generate excitement across the country before the Games that will be staged at a variety of locations, with the financial capital Milan and the Alpine resort of Cortina dAmpezzo as the two main bases. MORE TICKETS GOING ON SALE As the Games approach, concerns over whether competition venues will be ready and accessible appear to be easing after weeks of uncertainty. Additional tickets will go on sale on Wednesday for the womens Alpine ski races in Cortina, local organisers said, indicating that some of the fears over transport issues had eased. Reuters reported in November that ticket sales for the Cortina venues had been capped because of worries over congestion and access to the Alpine resort. Johan Eliasch, president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, told Reuters on Tuesday that preparations were back on schedule, with snowmaking progressing well across the mountain venues after a slow start. In Milan, the main ice hockey venue will hold a first test event this coming weekend, leaving little time to iron out any teething troubles. The surface at the new Santagiulia ice hockey arena will be a little shorter than NHL specifications, which had raised some concerns over the risk of more high-speed collisions. Players from the elite North American NHL are due to return to the Olympics for the first time since 2014.

The Ivorians will face record seven-time winners Egypt in a heavyweight quarter-final in Agadir on Saturday, a colossal clash that is a repeat of the 2006 decider where the North African side triumphed on penalties after a 0-0 draw. Yan Diomande and Bazoumana Toure were also on target for coach Emerse Faes team as they dominated the contest against the out-gunned Burkinabe and might have won by a greater margin but for some excellent goalkeeping from Herve Koffi. Diallo, 23, will go back to a new manager at Manchester United after the finals in Morocco having been one of the stand-out players at the tournament so far with three goals and an assist, driving the Ivorians impressive title defence. Theres this understanding on the field, this closeness between us, which makes our game easier, Diallo said. There is a real connection, a kind of little twist in the way we play. No one is trying to be the hero or shine individually. Compared to how they stuttered to the title on home soil two years ago, the Ivorians have been hugely impressive in Morocco and this was arguably their most dominant display of the competition to date. They took the lead in the 20th minute thanks to a superb solo effort from Diallo, who danced his way past three defenders before a fortunate deflection allowed him to lift the ball over the goalkeeper and into the roof of the net. DIALLO TURNS PROVIDER It was 2-0 on 32 minutes and no more than the Ivorians deserved for their positive attacking play. This time Diallo was the creator as his trickery on the right wing ended with a low cross that was cleverly left by Franck Kessie and the ball reached Diomande, who side-footed into the net from 18 yards. The Burkinabe were inches away from pulling a goal back as Dango Ouattaras shot from a tight angle hit the post, but it proved a rare bright moment. The Ivorians kept pushing forward and would end with 21 shots at goal, with one of those leading to their third score on 87 minutes. Toure broke free on the left-hand side of the box and with Koffi perhaps expecting a cross, the teenage winger instead netted at the near post for his second of the campaign.

Roma, who suffered their fourth defeat in six league matches in a 1-0 loss at Atalanta on Saturday, did enough to see off a Lecce side which had held Juventus to a 1-1 draw at the weekend. We didnt have much time to prepare the match after the Atalanta defeat, it was mostly video work, player-of-the-match Ferguson told Sky Sport. But it worked, we knew we had to win and we did it. The Roma forwards have been under fire of late. Roma had scored a disappointing 20 goals in 18 league games, with Ferguson and Dovbyk managing a mere two goals apiece before netting at Lecce. Its always great to score, the most important thing, however, was winning, Ferguson told DAZN. Now we have to reset immediately and think about the next one. We have a good relationship (with Dovbyk), we give each other advice. The visitors took the lead in the 14th minute when Paulo Dybalas pass found Ferguson just inside the area who found space between two markers to drill his shot into the far bottom corner. Lecce spurned a gilt-edged chance to equalise after the break. Konan NDri played a perfect ball across to the unmarked Santiago Pierotti who fluffed his shot from almost on the penalty spot, sending his effort well wide. Dovbyk replaced Ferguson on the hour mark, and 11 minutes later he wrapped up the win with the goal coming from a corner kick. A headed clearance fell to Niccolo Pisilli, whose attempted shot was diverted on target by Dovbyk.

Just as the round-of-16 tie was headed to a penalty shootout, Boulbina cut in off the left wing before unleashing a dipping shot that flew in, clipping the underside of the crossbar on the way. It was as much as the more enterprising Algerians deserved, having created more opportunities throughout the toughly contested encounter. Algeria will now be up against Nigeria in their Jan 10 quarter-final tie in Marrakesh. Algeria dominated the early stages at the Stade Moulay El Hassan as the Congolese adopted a cautious approach, and flying fullback Rafik Belghali caused panic when he whipped in a 21st-minute cross that DR Congo captain Chancel Mbemba, in his effort to clear, almost turned into his own net. But by the midway point of the half, DR Congo had forged a good chance of their own with a breakaway from Cedric Bakambu that forced a save from Algeria goalkeeper Luca Zidane. The resultant corner was headed narrowly wide by Axel Tuanzebe. Both sides traded rare chances as Ibrahima Maza went close to the target three minutes before halftime, and Mbemba had a back-post effort from a corner blocked in the 59th minute. Algeria captain Riyad Mahrez made little contribution but, before being taken off in the 70th minute, drove his free kick narrowly over the Congolese crossbar. His teammates, however, probed in the closing stages and saw Mohamed Amoura strike an effort from an angle straight at the Congolese goalkeeper Lionel Mpasi, who made another smart stop to deny substitute Anis Hadj Moussa in the 86th minute. In extra time, substitute Baghdad Bounedjah miscued a chance, and when he did connect properly soon after, forced a fumble out of Mpasi, but the goalkeeper recovered quickly. Mpasi, a reserve at Ligue 1s Le Havre, then kept his side in the contest with two sharp saves from Fares Chaibi in the final 10 minutes of extra time but there was nothing he could do to stop Boulbinas piledriver. I believe we deserved to win based on what our players delivered, said Algeria coach Vladimir Petkovic. We controlled two-thirds of the match and played good football, even though we faced some challenges during the game. I think we managed the match professionally. For DR Congo coach Sebastien Desabre it was a disappointing outcome. Unfortunately, luck wasnt on our side, but I have no complaints about the players. We must hold our heads high because we gave everything we had, he added.

At the Milano Cortina Games, however, she will not carry that burden alone. The 30-year-old American is the most successful skier in history with a record 106 World Cup victories. Her medal count, World Cup wins and discipline-spanning dominance place her in a league of her own. Yet statistics alone fail to explain why she shapes the Olympic conversation. What sets Shiffrin apart is her mix of technical mastery and emotional candour. In a sport that has long celebrated stoicism, she has spoken openly about pressure, anxiety and loss, particularly following the death of her father in 2020. That openness has changed perceptions of what greatness looks like under Olympic scrutiny, where failure is amplified. The Olympics have never been straightforward for Shiffrin. She has two gold medals, in slalom in 2014 and giant slalom in 2018, which sit alongside eight world championship titles. Yet the Games have also delivered disappointment, most notably at Beijing 2022 where she failed to finish her two strongest events. Rather than erode her standing, those setbacks made her more relatable as she addressed them head-on. This time, however, the spotlight on U.S. Alpine skiing has shifted. While Shiffrin remains the sports dominant competitive force and leads the overall World Cup standings, Lindsey Vonns return to racing has diverted attention. Vonns comeback has reshaped the media landscape around the Games. Long retired before resuming her career, Vonn once again commands attention, reviving familiar narratives around legacy and longevity, and creating a parallel storyline that eases the singular focus on Shiffrin. For Shiffrin, that matters. Vonn previously carried the same expectations - to deliver medals, to dominate headlines and to personify American Alpine skiing on the Olympic stage. With Vonn back on the start list, that symbolic weight is no longer Shiffrins alone. The presence of Vonn allows Shiffrin to retreat slightly from the noise and focus on skiing. In Cortina dAmpezzo, she will face stern competition from Switzerlands Camille Rast, who recently claimed back-to-back wins in giant slalom and slalom after Shiffrin opened the season with five straight slalom victories. If Olympic greatness is defined as much by resilience as by medals, Shiffrin arrives as the complete package, and when the Games turn their gaze to Alpine skiing, they will still find the American as the central focus - but this time, with space to breathe.

Its all happened so quickly, all my concentration and efforts and thoughts are going into Burnley. I know that sounds like a generic answer, but it is what it is, added the Scot.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY SportsREUTERS","['Jordan', 'NBA', 'Media']","Jan 6 - NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps has decided to resign from the stock car racing circuit less than a year after taking on the role, the company said on Tuesday. The decision by Phelps comes one month after NASCAR settled a contentious federal antitrust case filed by two teams, including one co-owned by NBA legend Michael Jordan and driver Denny Hamlin. During the discovery phase of the lawsuit, it was revealed that Phelps had sent inflammatory text messages regarding NASCAR Hall of Fame team owner Richard Childress. Phelps joined NASCAR in 2005 and moved up the ranks, eventually being named its first commissioner last March after serving as president since 2018. He will transition out of the company by the end of the month. As a lifelong race fan, it gives me immense pride to have served as NASCARs first commissioner and to lead our great sport through so many incredible challenges, opportunities and firsts over my 20 years, Phelps said in a press release. NASCAR said there are no immediate plans to replace Phelps and that his departure comes during a time of stability with an exceptional leadership team in place. The stock car racing circuit called Phelps one of NASCARs most impactful leaders given the role he played in transforming its annual schedule, expanding its international footprint, securing long-term media rights and charter agreements.

REUTERS/Claudia Greco","['Olympics', 'History']","Jan 6 - NBCUniversal has sold out advertising spots for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy a month before the start of the Games in early February, the Comcast-owned company said on Tuesday. More than 100 new advertisers have signed on for the Milano Cortina Games, making it the biggest broadcast and digital revenue earner in Winter Olympics history and the highest grossing Winter Olympics of all time, NBCUniversal said. The Games kick off a packed sports broadcasting schedule for NBCUniversal in February, which also includes the 60th Super Bowl and the National Basketball Associations All‑Star weekend. NBCUniversal said ad slots across all three events have sold out and the programming is expected to reach nearly two‑thirds of Americans over the course of the month. For the first time in our companys history, we have seen such unprecedented demand that we are officially sold out of our inventory this far in advance, said Peter Lazarus, executive vice president of NBC Sports & Olympics, Advertising and Partnerships. Live sports have been a key draw for advertisers at a time when overall marketing budgets for media firms have been under pressure, sparking a rush in the sector for rights to big events. The Milano Cortina Games will run from February 6 to 22, with events planned in Milan, Cortina dAmpezzo and other venues. The opening ceremony will feature performances by artists such as Mariah Carey and Laura Pausini. More than 85% of NBCUniversals Olympic brand partners are investing digitally. The adoption of streaming platform Peacocks ad innovations has grown 31% from the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics to Milano Cortina, the company said. In November 2025, the broadcaster launched the NBC Sports Network in a move to tap entrenched pay-TV audiences and expand its sports content distribution.
