After about five to 10 minutes on the tracks, he left the vicinity and uploaded the clip to Instagram. He was caught after an SMRT employee saw the video and alerted the police. On Jan 6, the 17-year-old offender, who cannot be named due to a gag order, was sentenced to 18 months probation. He must remain indoors from 10pm to 6am every day and perform 80 hours of community service.His parents were bonded for $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour. The teen must also attend all psychiatric and psychological assessments and treatments. He had earlier pleaded guilty to endangering the safety of others who were travelling along the railway. He also admitted to an unrelated criminal trespass charge. Deputy Public Prosecutor Xu Sijia told the court that in January 2025, the offender noticed two scaffolding structures leading up to the train tracks in Upper Changi Road. He then hatched a plan to explore the train tracks by accessing them via the scaffolding. In the evening of March 27, 2025, he went to the scaffolding area and waited for the people working there to leave. He then removed his shirt and wore it around his face to conceal his identity, before entering the area through a gap in a fence. He ducked down to avoid detection and moved towards the scaffolding structure. After that, the teenager lay down and squeezed through a gap between a gate and the ground. The DPP said: He then climbed up a staircase behind the gate which led to the train tracks. He paused halfway on the staircase and ducked down when he saw two people walking along a footpath. When he heard an approaching train, he lay down beside the train track to avoid detection and recorded a video of the passing train with his phone. After the train passed, he crossed to the opposite side while still recording the video. The teenager then snapped a photo and took another video of the train tracks before leaving through the same scaffolding. He later told investigators that he was on the train tracks for about five to 10 minutes, and saw between four and six trains passing by. Soon after, he uploaded the video of the passing train online via the Instagram Story function, making it viewable only to account holders in his close friends list. On June 9, 2025, he uploaded the video on his second Instagram account using the same function. But the next day, he found out that the video had been reposted on another partys Instagram account. Noticing that the video was becoming viral, the teenager deleted his second Instagram account to try and avoid detection. DPP Xu said: The accuseds actions endangered the safety of the commuters travelling on the trains… and himself, and also posed a real risk of disruption to train operations. In a separate incident, the teenager was at home at around 11pm on May 16, 2025 when he felt the urge to do some climbing. Clad in only his underwear and shoes, he left his home and took a lift to the 14th floor of a block of Housing Board flats. After that, he walked up a flight of stairs to the 16th floor, and went to the end of a corridor. A 27-year-old man was in his own flat when he heard noises nearby. He went to the corridor and saw the teenager leaning on a parapet ledge. The DPP said: The complainant felt scared and returned to his unit to call the police for assistance. While making the call, the complainant noticed that the accused was on the parapet ledge attempting to climb onto the roof of the HDB block. The offender made his way to the rooftop where he sat down, listened to music and made video calls before police arrived at the scene. When he heard some officers shouting for him, he walked to the opposite end of the rooftop, and made use of some ledges and laundry racks toclimb down. He then noticed bystanders and police officers on the ground floor looking for him. In a bid to evade arrest, he entered an 86-year-old womans unit through an openwindow. It is not stated where the window was located. He thentried to open the windows near the front door. When the teenager heard police officers approaching, he entered the victims bedroom and hid under her bed. The DPP said that the elderly woman was sleeping and did not notice the offenders presence. He decided to surrender himself to the authorities about 30 minutes later, and found the womans key on her bed. He opened the front door and surrendered to the officers, who woke the woman up and told her about the incident.', 'url': 'https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/probation-for-teen-who-entered-mrt-tracks-during-operational-hours-and-filmed-train'}\n",

Four other charges relating to the remaining amount were considered during his sentencing. He has not made any restitution to MDR. At the time of the offences, Siua was also the chief executive and director of several of MDRs subsidiaries – 3 Mobile Telecom, Handphoneshop and A-Mobile. These subsidiaries were collectively referred to as the group in court documents, and a search with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority revealed that he no longer holds these positions with them. Deputy Public Prosecutor Louis Ngia said that the group was in the business of distributing and selling mobile handsets and accessories. The prosecutor added that as the CEO of MDRs subsidiaries, Siua had the authority to instruct his staff to withdraw and deliver to him the firms mobile devices from warehouses for legitimate business purposes. However, he started misappropriating these company assets from November 2020 and sold them for his own financial gain. The DPP said: The accused started on this course of offending conduct as he had become addicted to gambling, and he wanted the monies to fund his gambling bets. He also realised that his staff trusted him to use the assets to the benefit of the company, and did not monitor his use of them or question his instructions. According to court documents, Siua sold these company assets with the help of his friend, one Tan Yeow Kian, then the director of a firm called Next Telecom, which dealt with mobile phones and accessories. The case involving Tan, 54, whom the DPP referred to as Freddy, is still pending. The DPP said that Siua, who was facing financial difficulties, had taken personal loans from Tan. He added: The accused acquired Freddys assistance to sell the company assets on his behalf. Freddy did not buy the (goods) directly from the accused but would act as a dealer by helping the accused look for buyers. After securing a buyer for those goods, Freddy would take a cut of the sale proceeds as his own profit. On occasions, the remainder of the sale proceeds was used to offset the amount that the accused owed Freddy. In 2020 and 2021, Siua misappropriated a total of 4,057 units of company assets worth over $2.5 million, the court heard. His offences first came to MDRs attention in December 2021. After using up almost all the subsidiaries marketing funds that he was handling, Siua approached the CEO of MDR for a company loan. Suspecting that Siua was facing financial woes, the CEO asked MDRs finance department to conduct a check on his use of the groups finances. The department then discovered a sharp spike in the groups marketing expenditure for 2021 compared with previous years. It also found that Siua had requested for numerous mobile devices to be released. The DPP told the court that these were unusual circumstances and MDRs CEO confronted Siua about the matter during a meeting. Siua came clean about what he had done, and MDRs chief financial officer alerted the police on Dec 15, 2021. Siua surrendered himself to the police soon after.', 'url': 'https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-man-who-misappropriated-over-2-5m-in-company-assets-while-he-was-coo-of-sgx-listed-firm'}\n",

Rizqins punch briefly left one of the victims unconscious, and hepleaded guilty in November 2025 to an assault charge. In earlier proceedings, the court heard that Rizqin – then a midfielder for Tanjong Pagar United – had taken part in a Singapore Premier League Under-21 League game on Feb 10, 2025. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thaddeus Tan had said that tensions between the two teams grew throughout the game. In one incident, Rizqin overheard a 17-year-old Albirex Niigata player taunting one of his teammates, said DPP Tan. Rizqins team eventually won with a score of 3-2. As players on both teams lined up on the field for the customary post-game handshakes,Rizqin punched the teenage Albirex Niigataplayerin the face. The victim cannot be named as those below 18 are protected under the Children and Young Persons Act. The melee led to interventions from players and staff of both teams, who tried to pull Rizqin away from the field.

Mr Chan Tuck Cheong sued Madam Sin Wee Hiong, claiming that she still owes him $222,000 out of the $495,000 he had lent her. Madam Sin denied that she owed him money. Instead, she contended in a counterclaim that she had lent him more than $1 million, of which $578,000 remains unpaid. She said she first lent $800,000 to Mr Chan in 2013 after she and her then husband remortgaged their matrimonial home in Serangoon Gardens for $1.26 million. Madam Sin said Mr Chan had asked her to do so because he needed the funds to redevelop his landed property in Bedok. In a written judgment on Jan 5, Senior Judge Chan Seng Onn dismissed Mr Chans claim for $222,000 and allowed Madam Sins counterclaim for $578,000. The lynchpin of Madam Sins case was a document signed by Mr Chan acknowledging the $800,000 loan, the judge noted. Mr Chan admitted that he had signed the document but claimed he did not receive the money. He said Madam Sin had asked him to sign the document so that she could show it to her husband. Mr Chan suggested that she needed money for gambling, which prompted her to hatch a plan to get her husband to agree to take a bank loan by deceiving him into believing that the money was to be lent to Mr Chan. But the judge said Mr Chan failed to prove that the signed acknowledgement was created as a sham document. As a long time had passed since then, neither party could provide bank records to help determine whether $800,000 had in fact been received by Mr Chan. The judge said the burden was on the claimant to prove that there was an intention to mislead Madam Sins husband, and the court required more cogent and forceful evidence to make such a finding. Justice Chan found that Madam Sin had indeed lent Mr Chan $800,000 in 2013, as reflected in the document. The judge concluded that the transfers from Mr Chan to Madam Sin between 2017 and 2021 were partial repayments of the loan. The judge also found that 12 further transfers from Madam Sin to Mr Chan between 2018 and 2019 were fresh loans. Justice Chansaid Madam Sin had given some substantiation that Mr Chan needed funds for one of his companies and his daughters overseas education. Mr Chan, a professional engineer, and Madam Sin are business partners in TC Sin & Associates, a firm that provides engineering consultancy services. The firm was started by Madam Sins father in 1972. Mr Chan joined the firm in 1990 and became a partner in 1994. He later set up other companies, including one named ICPH International. Mr Chanand Madam Sin were married to their respective spouses when they began their affair in 1993, though she divorced her husband in 2017. According to the judgment, the lovers were heavy gamblers and frequented the Resorts World Sentosa casino together. Madam Sin became a partner of TC Sin & Associates in 2019. She was also a director or shareholder in Mr Chans companies at various times. Her former husband, Mr Chow Kwong Wah, worked at TC Sin & Associates as a clerk of works. From 2013 to 2015, he was employed as a project manager at ICPH. When giving his testimony, Mr Chow said that he had treated Mr Chan as a colleague and family friend. He added that he was not wealthy, and that Madam Sins parents not only financed their honeymoon but also a large part of the cost of their matrimonial property. Justice Chan said that, against this backdrop, it was perfectly understandable why Mr Chow would be deferential to Madam Sins management of the finances, as he was fully cognisant that he did not contribute much towards their property. During the couples divorce, the unpaid balance of the $800,000 loan was not listed as a matrimonial asset because Mr Chow said he was not thinking about money at the time. He added that he had consented to Madam Sins request for a simplified track divorce in exchange for her promise to stay with him and the children for three years after the divorce,ashe still loved her and did not wish to hurt their children and grandchildren. The affair ended in 2022. In May 2023, Madam Sin sued Mr Chan forminority oppression, in response to his actions, such as removing her as a director of one of his companies. In July that year, ICPH sued Madam Sin, seeking recovery of more than $69,000 in outstanding loans. The following month, Mr Chan filed the current suit. The pair agreed to proceed with the current suit while keeping the two other cases on hold.', 'url': 'https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-lovers-fight-over-money-after-30-year-affair-ends-high-court-allows-womans-578000-claim'}\n",

Mr How, a veteran of 27 years, was appointed commissioner of police in a change of command ceremony at the Home Team Academy in Old Choa Chu Kang Road.

Those The Straits Times spoke to on Jan 5 also emphasised that their role will differ from that of elected MPs. This includes being able to examine Singapores longer-term challenges without being subjected to the pressures of electoral politics. Nine NMPs – consisting of eight new faces and one returning member – were announced by the Office of the Clerk of Parliament on Jan 2. This came after a Special Select Committee had deliberated on a list of 57 proposed names, the second-largest pool since the scheme was introduced in 1990. President Tharman Shanmugaratnam will present the instruments of appointment to the NMPs on Jan 8, before they take their oaths and affirmations at the next sitting of Parliament on Jan 12. The incoming NMPs are: Mr Azhar Othman, executive chairman of Enercon Asia Associate Professor Kenneth Goh Toh Chuan, Singapore Aquatics president Dr Haresh Singaraju, family physician at National University Polyclinics Associate Professor Terence Ho Wai Luen, academic and university administrator Ms Kuah Boon Theng, managing director of Legal Clinic LLC Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi, chief executive of Sing Lun Holdings Dr Neo Kok Beng, founder and chief executive of NEO Aeronautics Professor Kenneth Poon Kin Loong of the National Institute of Education Mr Sanjeev Kumar Tiwari, general secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees and National Trades Union Congress central committee member Jobs and economic development are a major theme for the incoming batch of NMPs, with an eye towards how Singapore should adjust its strategies and policies in the face of technological disruption. Prof Ho told ST he would like to focus on inclusive development, including how companies and workers can prepare for the future through human-centred work redesign, reskilling and lifelong learning. Prof Ho, who is deputy executive director at the Institute for Adult Learning at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said he hopes to draw on research insights from the academic community, including that of his colleagues from the institute. The economist said his maiden speech is likely to touch on the importance of learning agility, adaptation and innovation – both for individuals and the larger society. Ms Kuah, the sole female NMP in this cohort, said she intends to focus on issues such as technology transformation, the need to enhance workplace protections for healthcare workers, and attrition in the legal profession. The medical lawyer said she also wants to push for more adult daycare facilities to support the care of young adults with special needs after they complete their formal education, and for the fine-tuning of support schemes for the elderly and those with large medical bills. A director on the board of Assisi Hospice and honorary legal advisor to the Singapore Medical Association, Ms Kuah said her work made clear to her the cost of chronic illness and the burden on caregivers here. There is a need to always fine-tune the measures available to support those among us who are the most vulnerable and are facing the most challenges, she said. Dr Haresh said he will focus on supporting public healthcare workers by ensuring professional responsibility, workload and risks are better aligned, and on strengthening support for young families so parents feel more confident about starting and raising families. He said: As a family physician, healthcare leader and father of two young children, I see these pressures first-hand. I will bring these ground perspectives into Parliament in a constructive way. Mr Lee, the only second-term NMP this time around, said he intends to focus on business competitiveness, workforce resilience and regulatory agility, particularly as Singapore now operates in a more fragmented and volatile global economy. With decades of experience building and operating businesses across manufacturing and services, Mr Lee said he has seen how external shocks like tariffs, supply-chain disruptions, labour constraints and rising compliance costs translate into concrete pressures on companies cash flow, hiring decisions and long-term investment. These are not abstract issues; they shape whether firms expand, automate, or pull back, he said, adding that he will advocate for practical refinements such as upskilling that leads to job redesign and productivity – not just course attendance. Prof Goh, an academic researching and developing entrepreneurial talent, said he has seen first-hand how policy choices shape Singaporeans developmental pathways, career transitions, and outcomes. The former national swimmer said his maiden speech in Parliament will likely focus on how a broad, inclusive base of participation in sports can strengthen high performance, while articulating the wider societal outcomes of elite sport beyond medal tallies. At the heart of it, I hope to contribute to building a Singapore where people with diverse talents and passions can find their place, flourish, and contribute to our shared future, he added. Mr Tiwari said he hopes to focus on issues relating to workers well-being, fair employment practices, lifelong learning, and workplace relevancy, particularly for rank-and-file workers, professional, managerial, executive or technical workers, and mature workers navigating economic transitions. Having spent many years working closely with workers and employers, he said he has seen first-hand how national policies translate into real-life outcomes on the ground and intends to draw on this practical experience. Mr Azhar said he will contribute in the field of clean energy, sustainability, and local and international business concerns and growth, while Prof Poon said he plans to give a voice to those less heard, especially persons with disabilities. Dr Neo said the major themes of his NMP term will include economic vibrancy, national resilience, and developing a gracious and caring society. As a foster parent, he said he grieved over thetragic death of four-year-old Megan Khung,who died in 2020 after more than a year of suffering physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her mother and the womans boyfriend. While there were discussions on and measures implemented for physical abuse of children and youth in the aftermath of the case, Dr Neo also stressed the importance of looking at situations of mental abuse where physical signs are not detectable. He said: Our society should evolve from being considerate and kind, to active caring. We have to actively care for one another, looking out for one another and helping one another. On the role of NMPs, Ms Kuah said the members bring their own professional and life experiences to speak out on issues that they feel are important, unconstrained by party politics. Mr Tiwari said not representing a constituency allows NMPs to focus more deeply on specific policy areas and raise issues that may otherwise receive less attention by offering constructive feedback, highlighting ground realities and contributing thoughtfully to national discussions. Mr Lee said he sees the role of NMPs as complementing elected MPs and because they do not represent constituencies, they are empowered to focus on longer-term structural challenges, raise uncomfortable questions where necessary, and examine policy trade-offs without electoral pressures. The role (of NMPs) is not to oppose the Government, nor to replicate constituency work, he said. It is to stress-test policies, challenge assumptions, and improve outcomes through constructive engagement.', 'url': 'https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/from-jobs-to-healthcare-new-batch-of-nmps-hope-to-raise-range-of-issues-in-parliament'}\n",

Chubu Electric Powers Hamaoka plant – located in an area of central Japan at risk of a potential megaquake – is undergoing regulatory safety checks, with the aim of restarting two reactors. But the companys president said late on Jan 5 that the estimated maximum seismic ground motion that the plant could experience during a quake may have been underestimated. This incident could seriously affect the (safety) review process and undermine the trust of local communities and other stakeholders in our nuclear business, and potentially shake its very foundation, he told reporters during an emergency press conference. Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011. However, the resource-poor nation now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its heavy dependence on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence. The worlds biggest nuclear plant, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, is expected torestart operations laterin January, pending final approval from the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA). The estimate of maximum seismic ground motion is important for the earthquake-resistant design of nuclear plants. In September 2023 the NRA approved Chubu Electrics estimate of 1,200 gal, a unit of acceleration used to measure the intensity of quakes. But in February 2025 the NRA received information from a whistleblower that the utility may have used data different from what was presented to the nuclear watchdog, NRA official Keiichi Watanabe told AFP on Jan 6. Since then, the watchdog has been conducting its own probe, he said. The NRA suspended its safety review process for the Hamaoka plant in late December, and the issue will be discussed in meetings open to the public, the first of which will be held on Jan 7, he said. The Hamaoka plant is located in Omaezaki, Shizuoka prefecture, near a seismic fault line where a massive Pacific earthquake is expected to occur in the coming years or decades. In 2024, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first special advisory for a possible megaquake in the area, known as the Nankai Trough, before lifting it a week later. The government has said a quake in the 800km undersea trench and subsequent tsunamicould kill as many as 298,000 peopleand cause up to US$2 trillion (S$2.56 trillion) in damages. Chubu Electric said it had set up a panel of lawyers to look into the matter.

Phivolcs urged residents within the 6-km no-go zone to evacuate because of risks like lava flows, falling rocks, and other hazards. Mayon is the most active of 22 volcanoes in the Philippines, having erupted more than 50 times in the last four centuries. Its last magmatic eruption was in June 2023 when it spewed lava and noxious gases. The most destructive eruption came in February 1841 when lava flows buried an entire town and killed 1,200 people. The Philippines lies on the Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes. Phivolcs urged civil aviation authorities to advise pilots to avoid flying near Mayons summit because ash from a sudden eruption can be hazardous to aircraft. Since Jan 1, Phivolcs has recorded 346 rockfalls and 4 volcanic earthquakes, compared to 599 rockfalls in November to December 2025.

Martins scheduled meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang forms part of his five-day trip that he said would include a significant economic dimension, a clip posted on the Irish Taoiseachs X handle on Monday evening showed. The Irish leader was seen in the clip telling media that he would discuss with Li in greater detail trade issues such as beef exports and Chinas recently imposed tariffs on dairy, a day after a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. I discussed obviously the situation in terms of Irish beef exports into China, the tariff situation in respect of dairy products, Martin said, adding that Xi undertook to engage with Chinese officials in respect of those specific issues. Martin described his meeting with Xi on Monday as a warm and constructive engagement, covering a range of issues including bilateral and EU-China ties. On a broader level, I think the President was keen that Europe and China would have a broader framework to govern trade into the future, he said. Xi had told Martin during the meeting that China and the EU should bear the long-term picture in mind, according to state news agency Xinhua. Ties between China and the EU have been tense since the EU imposed levies on Chinese electric vehicle imports in 2024. China has since retaliated with a series of measures including the latest tariffs on EU dairy products. Last week, China also set import quotas and additional tariffs on beef imports from this year, a move affecting global exporters of the meat into the Asian country. The first Taoiseach to visit China since 2012, Martin has recently downplayed the Irish intelligence agencys portrayal of China as a hostile state actor, preferring instead to adopt a long-term and strategic understanding of China.

He doesnt reflexively rule for the government, said Mr Roger Stavis, the head of Mintz & Golds white collar defence practice, whos tried cases before Manhattan US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein. My test for a fair judge is: I could be disappointed in a ruling, but if I know the judge thought it was the right ruling, I cant complain. I complain if the judge knows the right ruling but doesnt rule that way for politics or some other reason. He passes that test. A Bronx native and Columbia Law School graduate, Judge Hellersteins shown an independent streak through a series of administrations since his 1998 appointment by former president Bill Clinton. Thats included siding against Mr Trump, whoordered the operation capturing the Venezuelan presidentwhos now a defendant in Judge Hellersteins courtroom. Mr Maduro pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation, and machine gun charges on Jan 5. Judge Hellerstein in April denied the Trump administrations bid to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, saying detainees facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act had to get notice and an opportunity to challenge their deportations before theyre flown out of the country. Hes a real believer in due process, said New York County Lawyers Association President Richard Swanson. Hes not going to be swayed by politics. If anything, Maduro should be glad he has a fair judge. Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan 4, Mr Trump said the judge is very respected. Well see how we do, adding were going to go through a slog of a trial. Judge Hellerstein, who declined an interview request on Jan 5, twice denied Mr Trumps bid to get the criminal hush money case against him into federal court. The judge said Mr Trump failed to show that payments to Stormy Daniels were part of his official duties as president. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the President – a cover-up of an embarrassing event, Judge Hellerstein ruled in 2023. That case is back before Judge Hellerstein now after the Second Circuit ruled the judge didnt properly consider the US Supreme Court ruling giving presidents broad immunity from criminal charges. Judge Hellersteins reputation as a judge was built partly through overseeing a trove of litigation against airlines and New York City related to the 9/11 attacks. In 2010, he rejected a settlement to resolve suits brought against the city by rescue and clean-up workers who said they were sickened at Ground Zero, saying the amount was too small. He later approved a US$712.5 million (S$914.5 million) settlement. Judge Hellerstein said in a Touro Law Review article that rejecting the settlement was a controversial move, and reflected on how his upbringing and religion have shaped him. Judge Hellerstein wrote that he would not want it to be said that I ruled in a certain way because I am an Orthodox Jew. But he said his rulings reflect all that influenced me, including my immigrant parents, my growing up in the Bronx, my public school education, service in the Judge Advocate General corps, and my Jewish education and my Jewish values. In a separate case, Judge Hellerstein ruled against families seeking to recover human remains from the 9/11 debris. Mr Norman Siegel, the former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who represented the families, said Judge Hellerstein impressed him by setting up a meeting in his chambers with the families to hear them out. Even though he didnt rule for us, he spent over an hour listening to them, and understanding their loss, their anger, and trying to explain to them the limits of the law, Mr Siegel said. Not many judges would do that. Judge Hellerstein ruled in Mr Siegels favour in a 1999 decision, later reversed by the Second Circuit, saying Ku Klux Klan members had a free expression right to march in masks. He believed in the rights of the quintessential, unpopular, controversial group, Mr Siegel said. Judge Hellerstein recently oversaw high-profile financial trials: the Charlie Javice case, the prosecution of Archegos founder Bill Hwang, and a trial against BNP Paribas. In those cases, Judge Hellerstein showed he likes to move things along and will let lawyers know. The jury looks like its bored to tears, Judge Hellerstein remarked to attorneys at the 2024 Archegos trial. I think you should stick to whats important, please. He wasnt having it at the BNP Paribas trial when an attorney took issue with Judge Hellersteins remembrance of Sept 11. That case, in which Sudanese refugees accused BNP Paribas of aiding human-right abuses, kicked off on Sept 11, 2025. The banks attorney, Mr Barry Berke, argued the judges invocation of the 9/11 attacks could bias jurors and, later in the day, moved for a mistrial. I heard nothing objectionable, Judge Hellerstein said. If you thought it was objectionable, you should have stood up. Judge Hellerstein showed another side of himself during Ms Javices September sentencing, seeming to take into account testimony concerning her good character. The government asked for 12 years after Ms Javice, then 33, was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase & Co in its US$175 million acquisition of her student-finance startup Frank. Judge Hellerstein gave her seven. The judge told Javice shed done a bad thing that required punishment, but added: Youre a good person.

We do not have US armed forces in Venezuela, and we are not occupying that country, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters after the classified session with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth and other senior officials. If anybody wants to use the term nation-building, or anything like that, it doesnt look like anything anybody has seen under President Trump, said Representative Brian Mast, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. They are not the protracted war administration, Mr Mast told reporters after the briefing, which lasted more than 2½ hours, when asked how he would reassure Americans they did not face another endless war, like the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. Mr Trump sent US troops into Caracas early on Jan 3 toseize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro,who pleaded not guilty earlier on Jan 5 to narcotics charges. Mr Maduros capture rattled world leaders, left officials in Caracas scrambling to regroup and angered some US Democrats, who said Mr Rubio and other Trump administration officials had lied to them by insisting they were not planning regime change in Venezuela. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senates Democratic leader, told reporters that the briefing on Jan 5 had been extensive, but posed more questions than it answered. Their plan for the US running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying, he said. Mr Schumer said he had not received assurances that Mr Trump would not do the same thing in other countries. Republicans also left open that possibility. Theres absolutely a continual plan to use the United States military to protect the homeland of the United States of America, Mr Mast said. The Senate is due to vote as soon as this week on whether to block further military action against Venezuela without congressional approval, a resolution co-sponsored by Mr Schumer. Republicans insist the weekend operation did not require congressional approval because it was very short and involved law enforcement to bring Mr Maduro to court in New York. Members of Congress, including some Republicans as well as Democrats, have long accused presidents of seeking to sidestep the Constitutions requirement that Congress, not the president, approve anything other than brief and limited military action needed to defend the US. Republicans have defeated repeated attempts to pass similar war powers resolutions since Mr Trump four months ago sent US forces to the Caribbean, where they have been firing missiles at vessels Washington says are carrying drugs. Mr Trumps administration accuses Mr Maduro of overseeing a cocaine-trafficking network that partnered with violent groups, including Mexicos Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombias FARC rebels and Venezuelas Tren de Aragua gang. Mr Maduro has long denied the allegations, saying they were a mask for imperialist designs on Venezuelas rich oil reserves. Mr Trump has made no secret of wanting to share in Venezuelas oil riches. US oil companies shares jumped on Jan 5, fuelled by the prospect of access to those vast reserves.

The video showed many security force members rushing to the palace after the shots.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be joined by more than 27 leaders in the French capital, along with senior US negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as part of broader efforts to put together a common Ukrainian, European and American position that could then be taken to Russia. Talks to bring the almost four-year conflict to an endhave accelerated since November. However, there have been few signals that Russia would be willing to accept current proposals on the table, with the issue of territory remaining a key obstacle to negotiations, and fighting between the two sides showing no signs of abating. Ahead of the Jan 6 meeting, diplomats said military officials, including the head of Ukraines general staff, were in Paris to put concrete commitments on paper so that leaders could provide political backing. Until now, military pledges have largely been vague. According to a note sent to the 35 invited delegations and reviewed by Reuters, the meeting will focus on securing contributions to a multinational force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, in coordination with Ukraine and with US support. The hosts also aim to agree on contributions for a wider set of security guarantees for Ukraine, including binding commitments if it is attacked again. Efforts will be made to ensure that planning by the so-called Coalition of the Willing contributing countries will be coordinated with the negotiating positions of Ukraine, the US and Europe. The note also suggests agreeing on next steps to increase support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia should Moscow refuse to engage in meaningful negotiations. We have reached agreement on the operational details of the security guarantees, a French presidency official told reporters ahead of the summit. We will explain how they are structured and the need for a long-term commitment from everyone involved. A senior European official said the hope was that firming up the coalitions guarantees would also help cement US commitments, which have been broadly outlined in bilateral discussions with Ukraine. In his evening address to the nation on Jan 4, Mr Zelensky said the meetings in Europe should become another contribution to Ukraines defence and bring closer efforts to end the war. Ukraine will prepare for both scenarios: diplomacy, which we are pursuing, or further active defence if pressure from partners on Russia proves insufficient. Ukraine wants peace, he said.

When everything else breaks down, defence is the final insurance policy a country has. Many of us believe strongly in international law, diplomacy and global cooperation. These ideals matter, and they should continue to guide how nations behave. But we should not kid ourselves. When interests collide and rules are stretched or ignored, military strength still decides what a country can protect and what it cannot. This is why Singapore has made a clear and deliberate choice to spend the most on defence in its national budget, over $23 billion or 3 per cent of gross domestic product. A small country with no natural resources, but possessing significant wealth and strategic importance, cannot rely on goodwill alone to stay safe. Venezuela sits on the worlds largest oil reserves, yet without effective governance and a strong national defence, that wealth has become a vulnerability rather than a shield. Resources can be pressured, constrained or taken when a state lacks the ability to protect its own interests. For Singapore, the lesson is straightforward. Everything we have built – our economy, our infrastructure, our way of life – is secure only because it is defended. Defence is about ensuring that peace remains the most rational choice.

While imperfect, this framework provided a measure ofpredictability, restraint and a shared language for managing disputes. Recent events –including the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the United States – have brought this underlying shift into sharper focus. Regardless of ones views of the individual involved, the episode raises broader questions about sovereignty and the extent to which power, rather than multilateral process, now shapes international outcomes. This does not represent a sudden collapse of international law or a descent into global anarchy. Rather, it signals a gradual recalibration. Rules continue to exist, but their application appears increasingly selective and contingent. For small and middle powers, this evolution is especially consequential. A rules-based order offered protection through predictability; a power-based environment demands resilience through adaptability. This transition is also reshaping perceptions of risk. Investors, boards and policymakers now incorporate geopolitics more explicitly into decisions once governed primarily by economics. Importantly, this is not simply a binary contest between rival blocs. Many countries are choosing neither alignment nor confrontation, but pragmatic hedging. For Singapore, the implications are nuanced. Our longstanding support for multilateralism and international law remains vital – not as ideology, but as national interest. At the same time, realism requires recognising that institutions alone cannot guarantee outcomes. Capability, credibility and consistency matter more than ever. We may not be witnessing the end of the rules-based order, but we are clearly seeing the end of the assumption that rules operate independently of power. Navigating this environment will require clear-eyed realism and sustained effort to ensure that strength ultimately serves stability.

Fernandez from AWARE for raising the important issue of access to the employment dispute resolution process at the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) (Taking employers to task for discrimination: How easy is the legal process?, Dec 29). Transient Workers Count Too has, over the years, assisted many low-wage migrant workers throughout the ECT process –from initial filing to final resolution – pursuing salary and wrongful dismissal claims. As the article notes, the ECT process can be complex and intimidating, especially for migrant workers who lack community support or face language and cultural barriers. We also wish to highlight the increasing length of the ECT process. In early 2024, the typical interval between claim registration and the first case management conference was about three weeks. In 2025, this doubled to six weeks. We have also seen hearings involving Burmese-speaking employees postponed by a month due to interpreter shortages. These delays prolong stress and defer resolution, often worsening employees financial and emotional hardship. We hope the relevant authorities give due attention to these resourcing and scheduling challenges so the ECT process remains timely, accessible and fair, particularly for those already structurally disadvantaged. We also support the articles call to broaden support for employees navigating the ECT process in anticipation of its jurisdiction expansion under the Workplace Fairness Act and the Workplace Fairness (Dispute Resolution) Act, highlighting where the ECT and the authorities can improve accessibility and address power imbalances. One practical example is the Community Courts and Tribunals (CCT) Friend Scheme. With tribunal approval, an employee may be accompanied by a CCT Friend who provides emotional and administrative support. Most employees are unaware of this option until we advise them. While CCT Friends cannot advocate for employees, they help explain instructions, take notes and locate documents. Our experience shows that this support empowers employees to participate fully in the process, leading to more equitable outcomes. We support efforts to encourage more organisations to provide such assistance on a pro bono basis, and strongly urge that vulnerable employees be referred to appropriate organisations early in the process.

Suddenly, all those music videos by bands such as American rock groups Nirvana and R.E.M. that I had only read about in magazines and newspapers were right there on my living rooms television screen. My first proper introduction to the American channel was in 1992, when the then Singapore Broadcasting Corporations Channel 5 started airing two MTV programmes – MTVs Most Wanted and MTV Top Asian Top 20 – past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. Technically, it was not the real deal.MTVs 24/7 music video channel would make its official debut in Singapore on cable television only in 1995. Still, it was a watershed moment for music geeks like me. I would stay up late, one finger hovering over the record button on the VCR remote, ready to commit my favourite bands to tape so I could watch them again and again and again. So, when I read about how MTV officially ended its music video channels worldwide on Dec 31 after 44 years – the brand itself is still around through its reality television and digital content – it felt like the end of a defining cultural run. But it also came as no surprise, as the channel had long ceased to be the primary vehicle for music videos. And honestly, who would want to sit in front of thetelevision set waiting for ones favourite bands to come on, when music videos can now be watched on YouTube anytime and anywhere? In an age of viral short-form videos on TikTok and Reels, snappy public conversations on X and Threads, and never-ending live streams, music videos do not have as much hold on mainstream pop culture as they did decades ago. That being said, the MTV brand will always hold a dear place in my heart. Watching the channel was a shared experience for a generation that grew up in a time when music discovery was a slow and communal experience. While the primary music listening experiences were audio-only mediums like cassettes, CDs and the radio, MTV played a big part in how genres – be it grunge, Britpop, hip-hop or pop – were enjoyed visually. From the cinematic drama of Guns N Roses November Rain (1992) and the raw, visceral energy of Nirvanas Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) to Michael and Janet Jacksons sci-fi epic Scream (1995) and Jamiroquais mind-bending Virtual Insanity (1996), watching a series of music videos on MTV back then made you feel like you were connected to the global youth culture. The VJs, or video jockeys,whohosted the local and regional MTV shows – such as Nadya Hutagalung, Jamie Aditya and Mike Kasem – became household names themselves. Starting in the late 1990s, MTVs presence went far beyond the television screen here in Singapore, as the city-state was also MTV Asias operational base. In 2002, the inaugural MTV Asia Awards took place at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. While it was not exactly populated with A-listers like the annual US-based MTV Video Music Awards, it did feature stars like American pop singer Pink, Irish boy band Westlife and J-pop queen Ayumi Hamasaki. The next two editions in 2003 and 2004 were also held in Singapore, boasting global acts such as Mariah Carey and Linkin Park, as well as home-grown darling Stefanie Sun and Taiwans Jay Chou. Ironically, that was around the same time MTV in the US started to pivot away from music videos to focus more on wildly popular reality television shows such as Jackass (2000 to 2002), The Osbournes (2002 to 2005) and Pimp My Ride (2004 to 2007). In 2010, the channel officially dropped the words music television from its logo, marking the complete transition to a broader entertainment network focused on reality shows and pop culture. Closer to home, after years of reduced original programming, the main MTV Asia channel finally made its exit after StarHub TV discontinued it in 2022. The final music video that played when MTV pulled the plug on its music video channels on New Years Eve was The Buggles Video Killed The Radio Star (1979) – the same one used for the launch back in 1981. A song about one medium replacing another, it reads more like a reminder that every innovation in how people consume music must eventually give way to something more contemporary.', 'url': 'https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/viewpoint-for-a-gen-x-music-geek-closing-mtvs-music-video-channels-marks-the-end-of-a-chapter'}\n",

It also stars home-grown actor-comedians Xixi Lim, Wang Weiliang, Liu Lingling, Patricia Mok and Henry Thia. Directed by Singaporean Jason Lee and opening in Singapore cinemas on Jan 29, the Chinese-language dramedy revolves around local influencer Kai Xin (Lim), who flees to Malaysia to avoid loan sharks. She unexpectedly reunites with Zi Hao (Wang), a former classmate who once stood up for her. Together, the pair participate in a pineapple tart baking competition, hoping to win the million-dollar grand prize and a pineapple plantation. Lee, making his feature film debut, reportedly went to Thailand to invite Usha, 79, to star in A Good Fortune. She earned the nickname Everyones Grandma with her acting debut as the beloved titular matriarch Amah in the popular tear-jerker How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies. A Good Fortune is made for audiences to laugh and relax during the festive period, said Lee, 29, in a press statement about his fully independent, self-funded passion project.

From sculpted lipsticks that look like art pieces to glassy lip tints that sell out overnight, C-Beauty is having a serious moment. What does C-Beauty mean? The rise of C-beauty How does C-Beauty differ from K-Beauty or J-Beauty? How do you know if the C-Beauty product is safe and authentic? What are popular C-Beauty brands? C-Beauty - short for Chinese beauty - refers to cosmetics and skincare brands born in China that blend cultural heritage, innovative formulas, and striking visual design. Merging cutting-edge technology with storytelling rooted in Chinese art, mythology, and modern aesthetics, the result is an emerging beauty identity thats proudly original, expressive, and globally relevant. In the past few years, Chinese makeup brands have exploded on social media, captivating users with collectible packaging, new-gen textures, and clever formulations. FromFlorasiss intricately carved lipsticks toInto Yous viral lip muds, these C-Beauty labels capture the spirit of modern Chinese creativity - sophisticated yet accessible, luxurious yet experimental. Singapores beauty scene has quickly caught on, with many of these cult names now available through local retailers, e-commerce platforms, and even physical stores. While K-Beauty (Korean beauty) popularised dewy, glass-skin minimalism and J-Beauty (Japanese beauty) built its reputation on purity and precision, C-Beauty stands out for its artistry, cultural depth, and storytelling. If youre wondering what is the difference between K-Beauty and C-Beauty, here is how you can tell them apart. K-Beautys strength lies in innovation and routine-driven skincare, while J-Beauty focuses on refined textures and long-term care. In contrast, C-Beauty places strong emphasis on design, symbolism, and mood - makeup as an art form rather than a utility. Youll find influences from ancient Chinese paintings, poetry, and architecture translated into packaging and colour stories. Where Korean and Japanese beauty brands tend to champion subtlety, Chinese makeup brands arent afraid of maximalism. Many C-Beauty brands thrive on bold palettes, ornate compacts, and a sense of narrative. The rise of C-Beauty has, inevitably, come with growing pains. Counterfeit products and unregulated sellers occasionally surface online, especially through third-party marketplaces. The good news: Chinas beauty manufacturing standards have improved significantly over the past decade. Now, many Chinese makeup brands operate under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certifications and are subject to stricter oversight under Chinas Cosmetic Supervision and Administration Regulation (CSAR) implemented in 2021. Still, vigilance is key. Heres how to shop C-Beauty products safely in Singapore: Buy from official stores or verified platforms.Stick to official Shopee Mall, LazMall, or dedicated brand sites likeJoocyee SingaporeorPerfect Diarys Official Store. Check packaging details and batch codes.Authentic C-Beauty products usually include brand-verified seals or serial numbers you can cross-check online. Avoid prices that seem too good to be true.Counterfeits often undercut by large margins. Read reviews and ingredient lists.Many top C-Beauty brands now provide full INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) listings and safety documentation in English. When in doubt, purchase from authorised local retailers such asWatsons, Guardian, or beauty specialty stores that list their partnerships directly on brand websites.

The first overseas-produced animated feature centred on K-pop idols prevailed over fellow contenders including Zootopia 2, Elio, In Your Dreams and Arco. The triumph over traditional animation powerhouses such as Disney and Pixar has fuelled expectations that KPop Demon Hunters could post a strong showing at the Academy Awards on March 15. The 2026 Oscar nominations are set to be announced on Jan 22. Meanwhile, Squid Game continued its dominant Critics Choice streak with a third best foreign language series win for its third season. Squid Game first made history at the 2022 Critics Choice Awards, becoming the first South Korean drama to win best foreign language series. At the same ceremony, star Lee Jung-jae broke barriers as the first South Korean actor to win best actor in a drama series. The series repeated its success at the February 2025 ceremony, once again taking home the best foreign language series trophy following the second season. American-French actor Timothee Chalamets Oscars campaign earned a major boost as he scooped the best actor prize for Marty Supreme. He defeated American rival Leonardo DiCaprio, whose raucous political thriller One Battle After Another took the nights top prize for best picture, as well as best director and best adapted screenplay for American film-maker Paul Thomas Anderson. In Marty Supreme, Chalamet plays a 1950s table tennis champion consumed by grand ambitions. Loosely based on the life of table tennis star Marty Reisman, a man driven by the belief that he can achieve fame and fortune through a sport little known in the United States, the film directed by American Josh Safdie has become an unlikely global hit. Josh, you made a story about a flawed man with a relatable dream, said Chalamet, who rigorously trained in table tennis for the role, in his acceptance speech. And you didnt preach to the audience about whats right and wrong, and I think we should all be telling stories like that, so thank you for this dream. The 30-year-old two-time Oscar nominee has in the past made no secret of his ambitions to win multiple Academy Awards, and will now be the front-runner. Irish actress Jessie Buckley won best actress for her tragic role as the wife of William Shakespeare in the period drama Hamnet. Australian actor Jacob Elordi won best supporting actor for his portrayal of the Monster in Frankenstein, which also picked up three technical awards. American actress Amy Madigan won supporting actress for a villainous turn in horror flick Weapons. Among the television prizes, hospital saga The Pitt won best drama, Hollywood satire The Studio won best comedy and teen murder drama Adolescence won best limited series. Best talk-show winner Jimmy Kimmel of Jimmy Kimmel Live! joked about his 2025spat with US President Donald Trump, which saw the late-night host briefly taken off the air. Thank you, Mr President, for all the many ridiculous things you do each and every day, said the American TV host. A Fifa Peace Prize would have been better, but this is nice too. The acclaimed Critics Choice Awards are presented annually by the American Critics Choice Association, an organisation comprising roughly 600 broadcast, film and TV critics and journalists from the US and Canada. Held early each year, the ceremony recognises outstanding achievements across film and television, and is often viewed as an early indicator of momentum heading into major awards races, including the Emmys.

Advisory fees from completed M&A transactions amounted to US$265.1 million, up 55.3 per cent from 2024. Equity capital markets (ECM) underwriting fees more than doubled to US$210.9 million, the strongest showing since 2021. Debt capital markets fees also recorded a historic jump of 55.9 per cent to US$155.2 million, marking the highest level on record. By contrast, syndicated lending fees fell 24.1 per cent to US$233.4 million. Home-grown DBS Group retained its position as Singapores leading investment bank, generating US$72.9 million in fees to capture an 8.4 per cent market share of the total fee pool. Despite the robust fee performance, overall M&A activity involving Singapore slowed. The total value of deals reached US$70.4 billion in 2025, down 9.1 per cent from 2024. The number of announced transactions fell 22.1 per cent to a 10-year low. At least fifteen deals worth over US$1 billion were announced in 2025, with a combined value of US$27.8 billion, though activity tapered off towards the end of the year as only one mega-deal was unveiled in the fourth quarter. Deals targeting Singapore companies rose 8.4 per cent to US$26.9 billion, underpinned by foreign investor interest. Inbound M&A activity, where a foreign company buys a local one, jumped 16 per cent to US$19.2 billion. Domestic M&A activity slipped 6.7 per cent to US$7.8 billion. Outbound M&A, where a Singapore company targets a foreign one, fell 7.2 per cent to US$22.6 billion, the lowest level in a decade. From a sector perspective, energy and power was the most targeted industry, accounting for 17.4 per cent of the total deal value at US$12.2 billion, roughly double the level in 2024. Real estate ranked second with US$10.3 billion, down 4.2 per cent from 2024. High technology followed closely with US$9.8 billion, up 37.6 per cent from the preceding year. Swiss banking giant UBS topped the league table for M&A transactions involving Singapore, advising on deals worth US$8.3 billion and taking an 11.8 per cent market share. Singapores equity capital markets slowed in the final quarter of 2025, raising US$1.7 billion, a 33.2 per cent decline from the previous three months. Despite the lost in momentum in the fourth quarter, totalECMproceeds in 2025 reached US$7.4 billion, more than double the amount raised during 2024 and the best annual total since 2021. The number of issues also rose by 66.7 per cent compared to 2024. A total of 38 initial public offerings (IPOs) by Singaporean companies were issuedin 2025, raising US$2.5 billion. Of these, 27 IPOs were listed offshore - two in Hong Kong and 25 in theUnited States -raising a combined US$662.1 million. Eleven issuers chose to list on the Singapore Exchange, generating US$1.9 billion in proceeds. Real estate players were the biggest contributors to ECM volumes, accounting for 42.7 per cent of proceeds, or US$3.2 billion, aided by capital raisings from listed real estate investment trusts. The high technology sector followed, securing a 33.2 per cent share worth US$2.5 billion, while healthcare issuers contributed 10.4 per cent of total proceeds. DBS Group secured the top spot in Singapores domestic equity and equity-linked underwriting league table for 2025, with US$983.6 million in related proceeds. Singapores debt capital markets staged a strong performance in 2025, with total bond issuance by local entities reaching US$41.3 billion.

Semiconductor prices have rocketed in recent months, as the industrys shift to AI-related chips has curbed production for traditional memory, while demand has been surging for both conventional and advanced chips to train and run AI models. Samsung is likely to estimate an operating profit of 16.9 trillion won (S$14.9 billion) for the October to December period, according to LSEG SmartEstimate from 31 analysts. This compares with 6.49 trillion won from a year earlier, and would mark the highest quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2018, which was a record high of 17.6 trillion won. Some analysts have in recent weeks raised their estimates for Samsungs fourth-quarter operating profit to more than 20 trillion won on the back of stronger-than-expected prices of traditional chips. The worlds top memory chip maker is set to release its estimates for revenue and operating profit on Jan 8. Prices for a type of DDR5 DRAM chip jumped 314 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to data from market researcher TrendForce. It expects conventional DRAM contract prices to rise 55 per cent to 60 per cent in the current quarter, from the October to December period. As conventional DRAM prices continue to surge, Samsung – whose production capacity is largely concentrated in this segment – stands to gain relatively more from the current price upcycle, TrendForce analyst Avril Wu said. DRAM chips are used in servers, computers and smartphones to temporarily store data and help run programs and applications smoothly and swiftly. DDR5 DRAM, a conventional chip, is faster and more efficient than its predecessor. In December, Micron Technology forecast second-quarter adjusted profit at nearly double Wall Street estimates. Micron chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said he expects memory markets to remain tight past 2026, and that in the medium term, it expects to meet only half to two-thirds of demand from several key customers. Samsungs booming profit marks a dramatic turnaround, just over a year after CEO Jun Young-hyun apologised for the companys disappointing earnings and performance as it lagged its cross-town rival SK Hynix in supplying high-end chips to Nvidia, the dominant maker of AI processors. Samsung shares jumped 125 per cent in 2025, marking their biggest annual percentage gain in 26 years. On Jan 2, Mr Jun said Samsung customers have praised the competitive edge of its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, or HBM4, quoting them as saying Samsung is back, which helped extend a rally in Samsungs shares to record highs in recent sessions. He did not elaborate on those customers, but analysts said Samsung is making progress supplying chips to Nvidia, potentially gaining share against SK Hynix and Micron. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Jan 5 the companys next generation of chips is in full production. The Vera Rubin platform, which will incorporate HBM4 chips, is on track to arrive later in 2026, Nvidia said. Analysts said Samsungs operating profit is expected to more than double in 2026 to more than 100 trillion won, as the chip price rally would more than offset slowing profit for its mobile business. Mr Lee Min-hee, an analyst at BNK Investment & Securities, said he was wary of Samsungs valuations, as surging chip prices may sap demand for PCs and smartphones, and cited risks of a demand slowdown for AI data centres increasingly relying on debt to finance investments. While the global shortage of memory chips is a boon to Samsungs mainstay semiconductor business, soaring chip prices are squeezing margins in its smartphone division, its second-largest revenue source. As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact, Samsung co-CEO TM Roh, who oversees Samsungs mobile, TV and home appliance businesses, told Reuters, adding it is trying to minimise the impact, which looks inevitable.REUTERS', 'url': 'https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/samsung-likely-to-flag-160-jump-in-q4-profit-as-ai-boom-stokes-chip-prices'}\n",

This will raise the portfolio occupancy of the pure-play data centre real estate investment trust (REIT) to 98 per cent, up from 81 per cent, said the mainboard-listed REIT. The agreement for the 10.8MW facility is expected to generate about US$14.8 million (S$19 million) in annualised net property income, or US$13.3 million based on the REITs 90 per cent share of the property. This represents a 35 per cent increase over its previous net rent, the REIT manager said. The REIT previously reported a net property income of US$67.7 million for the nine months ended Sept 30. The agreement commences on Dec 1. From then, the annualised rent contribution from investment-grade customers will go up to 82 per cent, from 79 per cent. The total portfolio weighted average lease expiration will be extended to 5.7 years, from 4.7 years currently. Mr John Stewart, chief executive of Digital Core REITs manager, said in a media briefing that the deal excludes tenant improvements, brokers from either side, leasing commission, rent-free periods and break clauses. He pointed out that the tenant will bear all of the fit-out costs; the agreement also includes a 3 per cent annual rental escalation clause with a no-break option for the tenant over the 10-year term. Digital Core REIT will invest about US$40 million in capital expenditure for redevelopment, which adds 13 per cent to the facilitys sellable capacity to 10.8MW, he added. Describing the deal as a strategic reset, he noted that the Linton Hall facility would account for 10 per cent of the REITs revenue. The facility has been sitting vacant since the previous tenant moved out of the facility on June 30, he added. Responding to queries from The Business Times, Mr Stewart said that the REIT seeks to continue delivering organic growth, particularly through its two assets in Los Angeles, California. We have two co-location facilities in Los Angeles, where we have both some existing vacancy and some opportunity to replicate our model by densifying or investing in the facility and bringing on a little bit of additional sellable capacity, he said. Based on its portfolio summary, the weighted average occupancy of Digital Core REITs Los Angeles portfolio stood at 90.5 per cent as at Sept 30. However, the REIT is not ruling out inorganic growth through acquisitions. Mr Stewart pointed out that it has US$15 billion in its acquisition pipeline from its sponsor, Digital Realty. We certainly have opportunities to invest and acquire, generate inorganic growth through acquisitions, he said. The counter had announced a trading halt on Jan 2, before the announcement.

The traders account on Polymarket built up positions in contracts tied to Mr Maduros removal on terms that implied long odds before the weekend raid. Those wagers, which were worth about US$34,000 prior to Mr Maduros capture, surged in value after news of the US military operation on the Venezuelan leader emerged, Polymarket data shows. The mystery trade is likely to attract scrutiny from US lawmakers who have been pushing for stricter insider trading rules, including a bipartisan effort to potentially ban trading of stocks by lawmakers. After news of the Maduro trades emerged on Jan 5, Democratic congressman Ritchie Torres said he plans to introduce a Bill this week that would bar elected officials, lawmakers and federal employees from placing bets on prediction market platforms where they could potentially access material non-public information. The anonymous account was created in December, with the trader buying up US$96 worth of contracts on Dec 27 that would pay off if the US invaded Venezuela by Jan 31. The trader then made several more similar bets in the following days. Prediction markets like Polymarket offer tradable yes-or-no contracts that allow users to bet on a wide range of real-world events, ranging from outcomes across sports, entertainment, politics and the economy. When a contract priced at a few cents pays out at US$1, traders who have access to non-public information tied to such contracts can rake in massive profits within hours or days. In September, Polymarket secured approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to relaunch its operations in the country, following its US$112 million acquisition of QCEX, a CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange and clearinghouse. The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it was looking into trades related to Mr Maduros capture. Polymarket has previously faced scrutiny on potential insider trading on the platform. While Americans at present do not have access to the main betting platform, many traders use VPNs to get around the ban. Polymarket did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Major stock indexes jumped and oil prices gained earlier on Jan 5, while energy shares notched big gains after Mr Maduro was captured by the US military during the weekend. The countrys default-hit government bonds also surged, buoyed by expectations of a large and complex sovereign debt restructuring. Bonds issued by the government and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, jumped as much as 10 cents on the dollar, or almost 30 per cent, as bullish investors swooped on the developments.

All six of the new Rubin chips are back from manufacturing partners, and they have already passed some of the milestone tests that show they are on track for deployment by customers, Nvidia said. Chief executive Jensen Huang touted the products during a keynote presentation at the CES 2026 trade show in Las Vegas on Jan 5. The race is on for AI, he said. Everybodys trying to get to the next level. Mr Huangs remarks signal that Nvidia is maintaining its edge as the leading maker of AI accelerators, the chips used by data centre operators to develop and run AI models. Rubin is Nvidias latest accelerator and is 3.5 times better at training and five times better at running AI software than its predecessor, Blackwell, the company said. A new central processing unit has 88 cores – the key data-crunching elements – and provides twice the performance of the component that it is replacing. The company is giving details of its new products earlier in the year than it typically does – part of a push to keep the industry hooked on its hardware, which has underpinned an explosion in AI use. Nvidia usually dives into product details at its spring GTC event in San Jose, California. For Mr Huang, CES is yet another stop on his marathon run of appearances at events, where he has announced products, tie-ups and investments all aimed at adding momentum to the deployment of AI systems. Some on Wall Street have expressed concern that competition is mounting for Nvidia – and that AI spending cannot continue at its current pace. Data centre operators also are developing their own AI accelerators. But Nvidia has maintained bullish long-term forecasts that point to a total market in the trillions of dollars. The new hardware, which also includes networking and connectivity components, will be part of its DGX SuperPod supercomputer while also being available as individual products for customers to use in a more modular way. The step-up in performance is needed because AI has shifted to more specialised networks of models that not only sift through massive amounts of inputs, but need to solve particular problems through multistage processes. The company emphasised that Rubin-based systems will be cheaper to run than Blackwell versions because they will return the same results using smaller numbers of components. Microsoft and other large providers of remote computing will be among the first to deploy the new hardware in the second half of the year, Nvidia said. For now, the majority of spending on Nvidia-based computers is coming from the capital expenditure budgets of a handful of customers, including Microsoft, Alphabets Google Cloud and Amazon.coms AWS. Nvidia is pushing software and hardware aimed at broadening the adoption of AI across the economy, including robotics, healthcare and heavy industry. As part of that effort, Nvidia announced a group of tools designed to accelerate development of autonomous vehicles and robots.BLOOMBERG', 'url': 'https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/nvidia-ceo-says-new-rubin-chips-on-track-helping-speed-ai'}\n",

Current CEO Campbell Wilson, whose contract expires in mid-2027, will not be offered an extension, the people said. Tata chairman N. Chandrasekaran has had initial discussions with potential CEO candidates who have experience running large airlines, including those with sizeable domestic operations, one of the people said. Air India is 25.1 per cent owned by Singapore Airlines, which has seen its net income pulled down by the Indian carriers woes. The Singapore carrier is helping Air India transition aircraft maintenance services in-house as part of its restructuring plan, people familiar with the matter said in August. Tata Groups discussions to replace the top leadership at Air India was reported by local newspaper The Economic Times earlier on Jan 6. Air India is unlikely to meet a target date of March 31 to break even operationally, a key factor in Mr Wilsons ouster, the people said. The carriers turnaround plan was dealt a blow when a Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed in Ahmedabad in June, the cause of which is still not definitively known. Representatives for Air India and Tata Group did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comments. Mr Wilson also did not respond to an e-mailed query. Announcement of a new CEO will likely come after the crash report on the tragedy is released, sometime by June. The agencies typically have a year after the incident to close their findings. There is instability at both of Indias top airlines right now, as larger rival IndiGo awaits the regulatory fallout after mass cancellation of its flights in December – triggered by pilot shortages and software glitches – stranded half a million passengers. The troubles at the two carriers, which together account for nearly nine in 10 domestic seats in the worlds third-largest domestic aviation market, is raising concern that Indias infrastructure and regulatory apparatus is not ready for rapid growth in air travel. External challenges – like supply chain issues that are affecting aircraft deliveries, and Pakistans closure of airspace to Indian carriers that has meant longer flying routes – have also impacted Air Indias financial performance.

Already 3-1 up in the series with the urn secured for another 18 months, Australia finished the day on 518 for seven with Smith 129 not out and Beau Webster unbeaten on 42. Heads century, brought up off 105 balls, was his third of the series, while skipper Smith hit the hundred mark for the 13th time in his 41 Ashes contests. There was disappointment, however, for Usman Khawaja, who received a rapturous reception from the Sydney Cricket Ground crowd as he came out to bat in his final test before retirement but managed only 17 runs before falling to a full toss. Sydney has offered the most bat-friendly surface of the series and it was heavy work in blazing sunshine for the England bowlers, especially in the final session when the shine had worn off the second new ball. England seamer Matthew Potts came in for particularly heavy punishment from the Australian batsmen in his first match in the series, going for 141 runs from 25 overs. Head made the most of the old ball at the start of the day when, resuming on 91 with Australia 166-2, he attacked with a relish that has become his trademark since moving to the top of the order in Perth. He hammered a four through the covers for his 12th test century before raising his helmet aloft on the handle of his bat and taking Australia to lunch at 281-3. Brydon Carse (3-108) had finally dismissed Michael Neser for 24 but only after the nightwatchman had faced 90 balls and England had burned their final DRS review in a failed attempt to remove him. That brought Smith to the crease and he put on 54 for the fourth wicket with Head before the opener, who had been dropped cold on the boundary by Will Jacks on 121, perished attempting to sweep Jacob Bethells occasional spin. Khawaja and Alex Carey, who scored 16, came and went as England got something out of the new ball but Smith batted on, firing a four past the bowler to reach the 50-mark for the 45th time. Australia were just seven runs behind Englands tally of 384 at tea and quickly overhauled it after the break. All-rounder Cameron Green put on 71 for the seventh wicket with Smith before departing for 37 courtesy of an ill-judged shot that ballooned to Ben Duckett at square leg. Smith, fidgeting and adjusting his equipment in customary fashion between deliveries, moved inexorably towards the century mark, however, getting over the line by scurrying for three runs. The 46,161-strong crowd, clad in pink for the annual Jane McGrath charity day, rose to their feet as one to celebrate a 37th test hundred from one Australias greatest batters. The 36-year-old had already passed Jack Hobbs on the list of highest run scorers in Ashes tests, his tally of 3,683 against England now trailing only the great Donald Bradman (5,028).

Kilde, who won a silver and a bronze at the 2022 Beijing Games, sustained serious injuries to his shoulder and leg, as well as a subsequent infection, after he crashed in Wengen, Switzerland in January 2024 during a downhill race. The 33-year-old raced his first World Cup speed event since the crash in November at Copper Mountain, Colorado, in Super G and was warmly welcomed back by the skiing community, posing for pictures with world number one Marco Odermatt. After 22 months away from racing, Kilde was understandably emotional after coming through the race unscathed. That emotion was matched by his fiancée, American ski star Mikaela Shiffrin, who watched from the sidelines with her mother as Kilde pushed past the finish line after months of uncertainty. Weve been a rock for each other, Kilde, who has 21 World Cup victories, told Olympics.com in October. Were always supporting each other. Shiffrin, who had been by his side in the hospital after the crash and rushed to embrace him after the finish, said she could not believe what was happening when she saw Kilde in the start gate. Im so proud of him, she told Swiss public broadcaster SRF after the race. While Kilde tied for 24th in the Super G race at Copper Mountain, the speed star managed to snatch 11th in his downhill return at Beaver Creek, Colorado in December. In both 2021 and 2022, Kilde had won gold in the back-to-back downhill and Super G races of the Birds of Prey event. This time around he started but did not finish the second of the races, which was shortened due to poor weather conditions. Norway has no shortage of elite Alpine skiers and it is unclear whether Kilde will get back to the Olympic stage in February. First, I have to make it there, he told the International Ski and Snowboard Federation in a podcast interview from December. Were not talking about medals, were not talking about trying to win it. Right now its all about me getting back into the game and thats number one priority. The official Olympic qualification period ends on January 18 and there are still a few key World Cup races to be held, including those in Wengen, Switzerland and Kitzbühel, Austria.

REUTERS/Pavel Mikheyev/File Photo', 'tags_list': \"['Candidates', 'Chess', 'World Cup']\", 'full_article': 'Jan 6 - Hikaru Nakamura split the chess world this year by reaching the Candidates Tournament after thrashing minnows at a series of low-tier events but the grandmaster is unrepentant and says any player would make the same moves as him under the circumstances. The world number two capitalised on a regulation that awards a Candidates place to the highest-rated eligible player, provided they have played at least 40 FIDE-rated games during the qualification period. With world number one Magnus Carlsen opting out of the world championship cycle entirely, Nakamura became the highest-rated eligible player by default and met the activity requirement, later describing his route to the Candidates as a Mickey Mouse path to the event that determines the challenger for the world title. Nakamuras peers took the more conventional route, competing at elite events such as the World Cup, Grand Swiss or the year-long FIDE Circuit, where grandmasters fought tooth and nail for one of the other seven spots at the Candidates. Nakamura documented his journey on social media, posting videos and photos of his opponents, who were stunned at getting the chance to play a super grandmaster - players rated above 2,700 ELO - at events such as the Louisiana State Championship and the Iowa Open. The controversy is complete nonsense, Nakamura told Reuters via a virtual call from the Global Chess League, where he was playing with the Fyers American Gambits. Any chess player, they know the game. Theyll do whatever they can to ensure the optimal outcome, just like they do when they actually play chess over the board. I think the vast majority of people did not have an issue with it. I dont see any issue with it, because I know that any player in my situation would have done the exact same thing. Nakamura said other players had gamed the system in the past to reach the Candidates, though his strategy was not well received by the governing FIDE, which introduced a rule mid-cycle aimed at preventing elite players from gaining points for beating weaker opponents. While FIDE told Reuters the adjustment was a technical necessity, Nakamura said it was a reactive strike against him after negative social media coverage. Its very much motivated by personal views and issues as opposed to whats good for the game, Nakamura added. I think FIDE are very susceptible to seeing comments on Reddit and Twitter. They have these knee-jerk reactions to what they view public sentiment as. When policy is dictated by a very loud and vocal minority versus the actual silent majority, you make decisions that are not in the best interest of the game. GAME THE SYSTEM FIDE said the rule was aimed at preventing elite players from earning similar points for beating an International Master-level opponent and a much lower-rated club player. If a super grandmaster starts playing dozens of such games annually, it obviously distorts the meaning of the rating system, FIDE said. With this in mind, we corrected this anomaly to protect the rating systems accuracy for the future. FIDE said its decisions respected current regulations and were not knee-jerk reactions to block specific individuals. Nakamura said the outrage on social media was unnecessary but added that FIDE should probably take steps to prevent anyone else from doing it. I would say that going forward, there probably should not be a rating spot at all, because I think its too easy to game it, he added. Chess players will game the system. The Candidates Tournament will take place between March 28 and April 16 in Cyprus and the winner will take on reigning world champion Dommaraju Gukesh of India.

Amorim was the latest manager unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford, which has witnessed more than a decade of decline since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The veteran Scot stood down after winning the clubs 20th English league crown following two decades of domestic dominance gilded by European success. Since then, United have not seriously competed to win the English Premier League or Champions League, despite a succession of big-name managers. Amorim, 40, is the first boss to be hired and axed since Ratcliffe took control of the clubs football operations after acquiring a minority stake in the Red Devils. He was sacked with the club sixth in the English Premier League, two days before United face Burnley away on Jan 7. The British billionaires arrival in February 2024 was greeted with glee by supporters desperate to see a new face at the helm after years of underachievement under the Glazer family, who still own a majority stake. Yet hopes that the boyhood United fan could make United competitive again at home and in Europe have so far been dashed. Just a few months ago, Ratcliffe, 73, said Amorim had three years to prove himself despite a tough start at United, adding that the club would not be drawn into knee-jerk reactions. But United have continued to drift, winning just one of their past five home games in the league. An apparent rift with the clubs director of football Jason Wilcox over tactics and transfer targets appears to have increased the pressure on Amorim, who was dismissed on Jan 5 after 14 months in charge. Wilcox moved into his current position in June 2025, taking over the main role held by Dan Ashworth, who lasted just five months at the club in an early embarrassment for the new regime. Ratcliffe has so far done little to suggest he can deliver on his desire to restore a club he admitted has become mediocre to former glories. The clubs ambition to win a 21st league title by the time of their 150th anniversary in 2028 looks less realistic with every passing season. United finished the 2024-25 campaign in 15th spot – the clubs lowest top-flight finish since they were relegated in 1974 – and missed out on European football for only the second time in 35 years. Despite a marginal improvement this season, Amorim departed with his side 17 points adrift of leaders Arsenal after 20 games. The club are still within striking distance of the top four but cannot afford to lose further ground. Ratcliffe has been publicly scathing of some of Uniteds transfer dealings before his arrival but the jury is still out on incomings on his watch. Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte have largely been peripheral figures since being signed under the managerial regime of Erik ten Hag, Amorims predecessor. Amorim was armed with an expensive new front three of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the recent summer transfer window but they have scored just 12 Premier League goals between them so far. Uniteds ability to spend their way out of their troubles is beginning to be squeezed by financial sustainability rules. The clubs desperate need to return to the lucrative Champions League will have been a factor in their decision to axe Amorim, who arrived in November 2024 feted as one of the games leading young managerial talents. To compound matters for United fans starved of success, Ratcliffe is asking them to pay more to attend games. At the same time, he has been criticised for swingeing job cuts as he tries to restore order to the clubs finances. In 2025 United set out plans for a 100,000-seater stadium to replace their historic but creaking Old Trafford ground. Ratcliffe said the club planned to have the worlds greatest football stadium, with hopes it could be finished within five years, though there is major uncertainty over the timescale. Plans on and off the pitch are undoubtedly ambitious, but they are a long way from being realised.

Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher has been put in temporary charge, with the club reportedly keen to appoint a caretaker manager for the rest of the season. Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville has called on the club to stop experimenting with managers and appoint someone who fits their traditional style.

The club has to find a manager who has experience and is willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking football. AFP Sport looks at potential appointments as United search for their seventh permanent manager since the departure of Alex Ferguson in 2013. Oliver Glasner guided Crystal Palace to their first major trophy by lifting the FA Cup last season. The 51-year-old Austrian, whose Palace contract expires at the end of the current campaign, has been linked with several clubs. Glasner, like Amorim, has mostly used a three-man defence with wingbacks at Palace, but in 2025 he told Sky Sports that his favourite formation is 4-4-2. Enzo Maresca parted ways with Chelsea last week after falling out with the clubs hierarchy. The 45-year-old Italian won the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup in his first season at Stamford Bridge and has been linked with the Manchester City job should Pep Guardiola quit at the end of the season. Former England manager Gareth Southgate, 55, is reportedly admired by the Old Trafford hierarchy and has been linked with the United job in the past. But it is unclear whether the former Middlesbrough boss would favour a return to club management after stepping down from England duty following Euro 2024. Unai Emery has transformed Aston Villas fortunes since taking over three years ago. The 54-year-old Spaniard masterminded a thrilling Champions League campaign last season and his side are now pushing Arsenal and Manchester City hard at the top of the Premier League. If Darren Fletcher, 41, hits the ground running during his interim spell, could he be a candidate for the full-time job at United? The former Red Devils midfielder has never managed a senior side but has a huge chance to impress. He may hope to follow in the footsteps of former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who landed the job permanently after impressing as caretaker boss. Thomas Tuchel has one job at the moment – to win the World Cup with England in 2026. The German, 52, has hinted that he is open to prolonging his stay but the former Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich boss could be tempted by the Old Trafford hot seat. Manchester United have previously been linked with a move for former Tottenham, PSG and Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine, 53, is currently in charge of the United States national team, meaning he could be available to take over after the World Cup. Spains Andoni Iraola, 43, has impressed since taking over at Bournemouth in 2023, securing club-record Premier League points tallies in his first two seasons. His three visits to Old Trafford as Bournemouth boss have included two 3-0 wins and a dramatic 4-4 draw in December.
